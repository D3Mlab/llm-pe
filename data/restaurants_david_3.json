{"Caviar & Bananas": ["Awful business model it took forever to even figure out where to order. on top of that the workers actually are not professional at all. on top of THAT my other half sandwhich didn't even have sausage covering even half of the bread. easily worst place i've been in a while", "Free parking garage.  Eat in grocery store or deli type restaurant....everything is by the pound.", "Awesome healthy food and really nice staff :) Mike went above and beyond to make sure that I got the food that I wanted. Can't thank this place enough for providing me with some greens and healthy options while visiting town!"], "Trattoria Totaro": ["The best food in town hands down. Authentic Italian done right. Takes a little while to make food this good, so bring two bottles of wine and enjoy.  Striped bass w/ crab is on point!", "I went with a party of six (they take reservations, thankfully), and we did BYOB. It took about 20 minutes to even get the bottles opened though. The service was VERY slow, don't go if you're in a rush. That being said, the food was excellent, everyone enjoyed what they got. But they need to hire some more servers, and ones that don't seem annoyed to be serving you!", "Great food good atmosphere great desserts awesome BYOB! Fresh homemade true Italian food, staff made us feel at home, great place to dine out with friends and have a conversation we never felt rushed to leave, would definitely recommend and will definitely go back!"], "Sushi Wasabi": ["It's a family owned restaurant, the environment is good, food was not served very fast but they definitely taste good. One thing, it is really over priced, extremely pricey.............", "The food here was not bad - probably better than most of the Japanese restaurants in town. However, I've never been kicked out of a restaurant. My friend and I came here for lunch recently and after our meal were just talking and catching up when at around 1:30pm were told they are locking the doors and asked us to leave. We weren't there for that long, probably just under an hour.  Ive never been to a restaurant that has kicked me out before and it's not like we were lingerers, we had just paid when the waitress came back and told us to pack up.  Anyways, that just tainted the experience for me and I won't be going back.", "The best in the city. Surfclam tataki and sankai maki are amazing."], "Roma Pizza & Italian Eatery": ["wow good food but    lousy service,counter people rude and delivery is the worst.then they lie to you.   really bad bad bad bad", "Been going here for about 10 years. Their sandwiches are awesome. It's hard to find a pizza place that makes a good hoagie that's filled with meat. This place has it. I'm not crazy about the plain and pepperoni pizza but when it comes to speciality pizza it's very good compared to local pizza places. I've been to them all and Roma is the place I go to for a good sandwich/wrap with fries. I've never had one bad experience after all of these years.", "I don't really get why some 'locals' love this place so much. The 'pizza' is not really that great. The last time I was here, I ordered a buffalo pizza and was very disappointed. The slices are very thin and even the presentation of the toppings and sauce made it look like a frozen pizza. In fact, it tasted exactly like the pizza I bought from a stand in The Gallery food court a few weeks prior. Even the adjacent  Wegmans grocery store makes a much better pizza. May be okay for sandwiches, but if you are looking for a good pie, go somewhere else."], "The Cruisery": ["First off, this place is way better than the place before it. I can see myself coming here regularly in the future. Beer was surprisingly very good and reasonably priced. The ambiance is a little strange but in no offensive way. It's warm, they've got games and what not, but when I came (close to opening), the place was packed. \n\nService was a little disorganized but that's to be expected of a new restaurant. The seating is a bit of a mess on the long table which only compounds the service issue, but I'm not too concerned. Staff was friendly, and I could see no problems when we were actually ordering and what not.\n\nNow for the big thing: Food and drinks. The whole menu is very creative, and frankly I'm very thankful to have a bolder restaurant on State Street. Almost every restaurant on this street does the same old same old style of American. Even the nicer ones, while they taste great, are culinarily dull. The menu items and cocktails at Cruisery are just different enough to be refreshing. \n\nMy only problem was that when you finally tasted it, it either was a bit under seasoned, lacked depth, or just needed a little bit of a finishing touch conceptually. For example, I got the steak flatbread, and while the steak was great, bread was crisp, balsamic glaze great, but the amount of ingredients felt rather small, and combined with the lack of sufficient binding (like cheese), it just rolled around more or less. I felt like I was eating steak, and then bread, but never a steak flatbread. I also ordered a seared ahi tuna burger which came with pineapple in it. I loved the idea when reading all the ingredients, but when I tasted it I felt that the flavors dropped off quickly. \n\nI think the guys and girls running this place have a great head on their shoulders food and business wise, but it needs a little time to work out the kinks.", "Apps and beer, all delicious! Buffalo sauce is spot on! Beer variety makes it fun to come and test your palette.", "Okay, here's the deal. I'm a huge insane yelp taker but not a giver. I only review when it's insanely bad or insanely good and this place is unreal. I feel like I'm in a dream. Amazing cocktails, incredible food, unbelievable venue. What more adjectives do you need? Get up and get here!"], "The Royal Indian Cuisine": ["Finally, a great Indian restaurant in Rittenhouse. They just opened up and we ordered Chat Papri-excellant. Great onion nan. Loved the Baingan Bharta. The palak paneer was ordered medium spicy and came mild and that is my only complaint. We really loved the food and will most definitely order from them again.", "Chicken tikka masala was disappointing, cubes of over cooked chicken breast in a sauce. Pricey for what it is... Samosa chaat was more like a stew. Hoping the next time the dishes will seem more like \"home\" cooked.", "Wow a serious disappointment. In fairness my review is the product of one disappointing Caviar delivery for three. Absolutely no service issues or grievances unrelated to the food (ie packaging, presentation etc). Quite simply the worst Indian delivery meal I have had in my memory. Insipid entrees, overcooked flavorless meats. I won't be giving this place a second chance obviously others might be more forgiving."], "Rat's Restaurant": ["I absolutely adore Rats and Grounds for Sculpture. Coming here is just a magical escape from reality. The food is stunning, and therefore worth the price, in my opinion. I've always experienced excellent service here. I love their Happy Hour, which is Tuesday-Friday, 3-7 pm. They have discounted wine and beer and some delicious small plates! You need to try the poutine immediately. They will even give you your drinks in a to-go cup so you can imbibe while wandering the grounds.", "My fiance and I dined here for brunch on the Sunday morning of our four year anniversary. We've been to Grounds for Sculpture multiple times, and it is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL place. This was our first time, however, eating at Rat's. \n\nIt is located behind the grounds, but it isn't any less beautiful. I could feel myself getting overwhelmed with excitement by how gorgeous and bright the exterior was. The inside is just as classy. We were seated and we ordered a Blood Orange Pop (my fiance gave it a BIG thumbs up!), a mimosa (very strong but very good), and coffee (which was included with the brunch). After the set up was explained to us, we made our way to the buffet. \n\nThere is a LOT of options, especially if you're an omnivore. We, however, are vegetarians. There was still a ton for us to eat, but there was way more meat than there was non-meat. And that's okay! If you're a vegetarian, you will definitely find yummy food. Especially the pancakes, potatoes, omelettes, and pastry basket. All of it was A+ food. \n\nWe spent about two and a half hours there - eating and talking. This brings me to why one star was docked. While it was nice to relax before a long day of adventuring for our anniversary, we were on a schedule. The staff is VERY kind, but quite slow. We waited a long time for our check and a long time for them to process our payment. After our waiter brought out of finalized check, he also brought out another dish of desserts that said Happy Anniversary! in chocolate. Such a sweet touch! I would recommend brunch to anyone celebrating something special, because it IS pricey at 44 a person and extra for any drinks you may want (except the tap water, coffee, and tea).", "I went to Rats for the first time with a party of six recently for lunch.  The place is beautiful.  Although the waitress was initially charming and helpful, she all but ignored us after taking our order.  I ordered a salad as an entree as there are almost no vegetarian options.  The salad was overdressed and unimpressive.  Three of our party ordered burgers which they enjoyed but there wasn't anything special about them.  Although we did not order any of the things the restaurant seems well known for, I expected much more for the price point of Rats."], "The Parish": ["I love what they have done with the space and the ambiance is great!  I ordered the root-beer vodka ~ house infused specialty to my dismay they were OUT!   So I ordered up a lemon drop martini (awful) but moving on to the GUMBO, oh yea baby it  was the best thing I have had since having it at the FRENCH QTR years ago ( my understanding it is same owner). My hubby and I both love Gumbo and we can't wait to go back it was so delicious and the hush puppies on the side were absolutely oh so yummy!  happy hour pricing is great!", "Two friends and I stopped by The Parish tonight for happy hour. I started off with a lovely glass of $3 red wine and we shared the bacon popcorn appetizer. I couldn't stop licking my fingers, and grabbing any last bits of seasoning from the bowl. For the main course I had the French quarter gumbo. It came in a bowl with a cute mound of rice in the middle and a smattering of hush puppies on the side. The gumbo was delicious and the hush puppies crunchy and tasty. One friend had the Parish burger and fries - I would have helped her finish it but I was already stuffed. The small bite I had made me want more. Our server was friendly and attentive. The only downside was that the decor didn't match the hipness of the menu. The private booth behind us looked inviting but the main dining area is a little bland. Perhaps this is a starting point and they will upgrade in the future.", "The Parish is amazing!  Amazing people!  Amazing food!  If you like food that was actually made for YOU! This the place!  Drinking Angel is amazing!  The Chop!  Steak Salad!  BEST BURGER in Tucson!  I love this place!  Put it on your list!"], "The Lark": ["Larkellen is the definition of boutique!  Tucked away in the Arlington Gardens Mall, this adorable little shop has a variety of specialty items that you don't even know that you need/want.  The shop is family run and the owner, Meme, has a great style and flair that is clearly the inspiration behind the store.  If you are looking for a wedding or hostess gift, this would be the perfect spot to come.  Inside they have kitchen and home goods items, including inspirational hand towels, gourmet gluten-free cookie mixes, and super sleek ice cream scoops.  You can also find some clothing and accessory items such as snarky t-shirts, jewelry, beautiful leather wallets, and funky boots.  For the men in your lives, they have some shaving essentials, cool watches, and really unique barware.  Meme was very proud to show me around her store and gave me an explanation of how they work hard to stock as many fair trade, local items as possible, and if not local, at least small batch, made in the USA.  Awesome!  I ended up buying myself a new wallet/clutch as I couldn't resist walking out of this adorable new store without a little treat for myself.  The selection is limited and the prices are on the higher side, but the quality and uniqueness is certainly there!  I will be back for gifts (and hopefully avoid indulging in more presents for myself).", "Cute items, but so expensive. I can't bring myself to pay $24 for a canvas tote bag (the $1 bags you can find at any grocery store) just because it has Nevada on it, or spend $30+ for a candle. Cute store, way too pricey.", "Very neat store! It is a boutique store with reasonable prices and unique items.\n \nThey stock their store with items that are difficult to come by elsewhere instead of just selling items you can easily find around town for boutique prices. They make an effort to put locally/American made items in this store. Local supporting local makes the world go round. \n\nOn top of this, the owner is very nice. You can tell they are proud of the store, when I went there, they took the time to show me everything that makes them special. \n\nThe first time I went I had some difficultly finding it, and if I were better at directions I would give you some fantastic advice on how to get there... but really just use a Map app for directions and you're set! \n\nThis is  a great place to buy gifts for all occasions, don't forget Father's Day is coming up."], "Jane": ["I had a fabulous lunch here the other day - a great wine list, yummy sandwiches and a little something for everyone. The staff was friendly, the overall atmosphere was casual chic and it was a bit of a ways down State Street away from the crowded shops. I had a great time and would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Santa Barbara.", "First time at Jane.  All I can say is AMAZING!!  Our waitress, Mariah, was great, attentive, polite, and gave great suggestions, one of which was the appetizer.  A plate full of deliciousness, baby scallops on a plate with pesto sauce, fresh mozzarella, slices of tomatoe and avocado.  The scallops were to cooked to perfection.  My husband ordered the Texas burger and said it was the best burger he'd had in a long time.  I ordered the chicken and fried Brie sandwich and it was to die for.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and caramelized onions on the sandwich put the sandwich over the top.  Yummmmmm!!  We also ordered dessert.  I had the coconut cake, my husband ordered the lemon tart and I must say the coconut cake was delicious but after trying his lemon tart I would have preferred that, just my personal taste.  All in all, this was the best meal we had here in Santa Barbara on our four-day stay!", "10/15/2011\n\nService kind and prompt. Food very tasty.  Consilience wine offering (Syrah) was very good."], "Azul Restaurant and Lounge": ["Arrived here Friday night to dine with a friend, and what a treat! Excellent atmosphere. Excellent service. Excellent food. I haven't enjoyed a meal like this since an anniversary dinner at Jano's. Albeit, the company was outstanding, but everything about the Westin makes enjoying time with friends, that much richer. Thanks to the Westin, for an amazing evening, and to my friend Helen.", "They have redone their menu since I was here last summer and it was delicious!!! I was a little bit disappointed in the artichoke that we started off with, however, I had the steak for dinner and it was amazing!!!! Had the bacon wrapped shrimp also for an appetizer and it was delicious!! Excited for dinner tomorrow night!", "The deserts are amazing. The service was great. Very patient with the kids. Breakfast was Solid too.\nIn addition to the wonderful view of the mountains, the food is great"]}
