business model it took forever to even figure out where to order. on top of that the workers actually are not professional at all. on top of THAT my other half sandwhich didn't even have sausage covering even half of the bread. easily worst place i've been in a while","1":"The best food in Conshy hands down. Authentic Italian done right. Takes a little while to make food this good, so bring two bottles of wine and enjoy.  Striped bass w\/ crab is on point!","2":"I went with a party of six (they take reservations, thankfully), and we did BYOB. It took about 20 minutes to even get the bottles opened though. The service was VERY slow, don't go if you're in a rush. That being said, the food was excellent, everyone enjoyed what they got. But they need to hire some more servers, and ones that don't seem annoyed to be serving you!","3":"Great food good atmosphere great desserts awesome BYOB! Fresh homemade true Italian food, staff made us feel at home, great place to dine out with friends and have a conversation we never felt rushed to leave, would definitely recommend and will definitely go back!","4":"Free parking garage.  Eat in grocery store or deli type restaurant....everything is by the pound.","5":"Dined at the restaurant for the first time tonight.  The food was excellent.  The kitchen is most accommodating.  I ordered the roasted pear salad which was listed on the menu as being served with gorgonzola cheese and a red wine vinegrette.  I asked if they could substitute goat cheese and the apricot vinaigrette which was served on another salad - NO PROBLEM, \nOsso Bucco is my favorite veal dish and Trattoria Totaro's is one of the best I have ever had. It was served with risotto and broccoli rate - both excellent. My friend loved her Veal Vivian.  Portions are very generous and the food is served piping hot and plated well. The lemon cake we shared for dessert was delicious - very light and refreshing.  Our server Donna could not have been nicer.  Will certainly return very soon.","6":"Awesome healthy food and really nice staff :) Mike went above and beyond to make sure that I got the food that I wanted. Can't thank this place enough for providing me with some greens and healthy options while visiting Nashville!","7":"It's a family owned restaurant, the environment is good, food was not served very fast but they definitely taste good. One thing, it is really over priced, extremely pricey.............","8":"Our party of 4 had dinner here tonight for the first time and look forward to our next time! Great food, service and ambiance. The owners were onsite and took the time to ask us about our meal, which was wonderful. Highly recommend!","9":"I could go broke trying everything offered in this place. It's set up like a modern day cafeteria. You can chose where you want to eat whether its a salad bar, Wine and dessert bar, sandwich counter, or glass case with numerous tasty options. I opted for the salad and it was great. You can choose from their menu or create your own. I also sat at the bar and ordered ginger tea.\nThe ambience of this place is good and makes you feel you are in a mainstream city. Definitely check it out!","10":"The food here was not bad - probably better than most of the Japanese restaurants in Edmonton. However, I've never been kicked out of a restaurant. My friend and I came here for lunch recently and after our meal were just talking and catching up when at around 1:30pm were told they are locking the doors and asked us to leave. We weren't there for that long, probably just under an hour.  Ive never been to a restaurant that has kicked me out before and it's not like we were lingerers, we had just paid when the waitress came back and told us to pack up.  Anyways, that just tainted the experience for me and I won't be going back.","11":"This place is so yum! I came here while visiting Nashville and I really wish we had this place in Chicago.\n\nI ordered a Build Your Own Salad with arugula, chicken, goat cheese, strawberries, and vanilla-poached pears. Super fresh and healthy. They do cram the salad into this jam-packed plastic container, and when you open the container, your salad contents will likely overflow out of the container. Why is it not socially acceptable to eat salad out of a huge basin-like serving bowl?? :)\n\nThey also had this amazing-looking section of desserts. I ordered the peach carrot cake, which unfortunately was just okay. The frosting was buttercream; it probably would have been better with cream cheese frosting. It's a definite pass, so only deducting one star due to the sub-par dessert. But I would definitely return!","12":"GORGEOUS interior and upbeat atmosphere. Since I'm new to Nashville, I enjoy checking out some of the more popular places in town and Caviar & Bananas did not disappoint! \n\nAmple amounts of seating, large lattes that are actually large and everything you could imagine for satisfy your appetite. Wine? Check. Sweets? Check? Savory lunch sandwiches? CHECK!\n\nI ordered a large iced caramel latte with jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits and OH MY! Those grits soothes my soul.\n\nI love everything C&B has to offer and I cannot wait to become a regular!","13":"Visited twice. Great decor and vibe, and the quality of food to match. Had the Baja Salad with grilled shrimp. Great portion size for the cost. Only problem is that the shrimp on the salad were so freshly grilled that one wasn't fully cooked. Excellent selection of sparkling waters and sodas in the cooler as well. Quick check out process and good service overall. I'm glad they are here and will visit again!","14":"The best in the city. Surfclam tataki and sankai maki are amazing.","15":"I enjoy the vast selection of healthy food options at Caviar & Bananas. The atmosphere feels very L.A. The white and black decor is perfect. What I don't appreciate is the parking situation. My first time parking in the deck, I thought that I would get an hour free. I grabbed the ticket from the station and parked (it's very narrow and cramped FYI) on the 3rd floor. The parking spaces are not generous nor are the compact spaces truly *compact.* So, whomever your parking company is, however closely affiliated, there should be better customer service reps available to communicate that you HAVE TO VALIDATE your parking. Clear signage would be much appreciated. I'm a pretty observant person and there may have been one sign anywhere in the vicinity. Most places simply note that you've selected an hour and you don't have to reenter the ticket or it notes your \"in and out\" times and doesn't charge you for less than an hour. This is a fault that is easy to fix. Also, the attendant was less than friendly when I told him it was my first time parking there and if he could make this one exception since the place was right there - he said \"Nope. Nothing I can do\" and just waited for one of us, my co-worked or myself to pay $3.00 when we were there for 45 minutes. It wouldn't read my card w\/ a chip but did read hers which also had a chip. Attendants shouldn't be rude or unhelpful. \n\nTherefore, in busy places like Nashville, you are only as good as your parking. That gets more people to you on a regular basis and also return customers. If it is difficult to get to you - then you'll suffer. Regardless, this business will most likely flourish but the parking company may get replaced. I'll be back, but I doubt when I have to park there.","16":"Great atmosphere, awesome service, and specials that are out of this world! Byob and reasonable prices. Be sure get a reservation early there is limited seated.","17":"This restaurant is very cute and cozy. It's located in a strip mall near Southgate and easy to miss. The food is reasonably priced and their salmon sashimi is great - very fresh! Hard to find sashimi in this city that isn't partially frozen...","18":"Enjoyed a nice Sunday brunch with a tall caramel latte.  Jalapeno cheddar bacon grits where on point.","19":"The interior of the cafe is gorgeous. You can tell a lot of thought and detail went into designing it, and it's a lovely place to dine. However, the food simply seemed subpar. Almost like it doesn't quite match how nice of a place it is. Now, I've only been for breakfast so I cannot speak to their lunch and dinner options, but the BYO egg sandwich was just ok, and my latte definitely left something to be desired. I can make a better latte at home and wish I would have instead of spending $5 on this one. I felt like the quality of the food and coffee was about the same as Starbucks. Just ok. Nothing to rave about. And more expensive. I probably won't be recommending this place to others, and I definitely won't be back for breakfast.","20":"Very Cute French style market and restaurant. 3 different ordering areas...brunch\/breakfast, sandwiches\/hot food, and salads. Wine\/beer cooler area as well. Great options at all ordering areas and very stylish decor.  Very posh place! Wine on draft and fros\u00e8!! Brunch was very tasty as well! Enjoyed the B.E.L.T and breakfast sandwich! Cheese grits were so cheesy and delicious! All staff were very helpful and friendly! The pastry items also looked divine, but we were too full to indulge! They will validate your Parking garage ticket for 1 hour as well! They also have a lot of local items for sale (seasonings, drinks mixes, jams\/ jellies and sauces) that would make a great gift basket! You can dine in or order to go and I even plan on bringing my hubs here to get some yummy snacks to take on a picnic at Centennial park (when the weather is warmer!)","21":"This is a BYOB. Off the beaten track kind of place - good food, good prices - excellent wait staff.  The restaurant is kind of small, so calling ahead might be a good idea. \n\nNot opened Sundays - kind of a drag.","22":"I was invited for the soft opening for the restaurant over the weekend, so that needs to be taken into great consideration for this review.\n\nThe space: beautiful, clean, bright....very Dean & Deluca'esque. Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.\nThe prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)\nThe service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.\nThe food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.\n\nGrits were delish, but lacked any jalape\u00f1o spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.\nAnother friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.\n\nAlso, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well. \nI would imagine the night time wine bar is pretty nice as well - okay, I'd probably give another try for a special brunch or drink if I ever venture into Midtown.","23":"The food is out of this world. The sweet Italian sausage, the striped bass, the salmon. Delicious!  And Victoria is the best.waitress.ever. She took such great care of us. No one better.","24":"If you are ever in Conshohocken and are craving italian, this is the place to go. My god this place is delicious. \n\nI went on a double date during restaurant week, so I had a set menu to choose from. However, their menu compared to others during restaurant week was pretty large with several options. I even asked for no  mushrooms and they were able to accommodate. Not all places do that during restaurant week. \n\nThe restaurant is a quaint area with food to die for. Fresh pasta, bread, and BYO! They were a bit busy as it seemed like there was a large party, however, the waiters handled it with ease. My boyfriend and I are excited to go back and take a look at the whole menu.","25":"Perfect lunch place and great for vegetarians because there is a build-your-own salad and sandwich bar. I created a veggie sandwich which was very tasty. Since it's also a market there is a large selection of drinks and snacks.","26":"We really enjoyed the food at this BYOB!  It is a bit off the beaten track in a semi-residential area. We went with friends on a Tuesday night and were a little concerned that the place was empty, but we decided to give it a chance, and were very happy we did.  We split a couple of salads (nuts and berries salad and grilled pears salad) and were very happy with those.  There was plenty to share and it was tasty.  Two of us got a red snapper special (which, tho they didn't quote the price, turned out to be very much in line with the standard menu prices).  It was absolutely delicious, prepared perfectly, and came with a very flavorful risotto and some thin asparagus.  It was described as having a pear sauce which might be true but a pear flavor did not particularly stand out, tho it was indeed very light and flavorful. One of our friends got the gorgonzola chicken which was also quite delicious, with a slight, very pleasant smoky flavor atop the strong gorgonzola flavor. It also had some asparagus, My wife got the Osso Bucco (veal shank) which was very savory and tender.  Everybody was pleasantly surprised at the thorough enjoyment of the meal.  We topped it off by splitting an order of cannolis for dessert.  The atmosphere is casual and informal, but pleasant, very fitting of its name \"trattoria\",  The chef came out to check in with us briefly a couple of times and was warm and friendly without being overbearing.  The service was also very accommodating and attentive, though as the only customers, we would expect that.  The entrees all ran fairly expensive in the $25-$30 range but we were very pleased and satisfied with the meal.  As a BYOB we certainly saved money on drinks, and I don't recall being charged any corkage fee.  Overall with tax and tip the meal came to about $44 each. I would highly recommend this place and will be back.","27":"I travel quite a bit for work and I always seek out the hole in the wall places that always seem to hit the mark. This is definitely one of them. The fish was fresh, the warm sake was warm, and the staff was friendly. I also had the pleasure of trying a grilled shrimp head instead of the usual fried. I am a fan!! The head had all the flavor with no grease. I will definitely return the next time I am in Edmonton!","28":"Friendly service. The shrimp alfredo was quite tasty! We also enjoyed a special lobster ravioli and saccetti w grilled chicken. Kids are tweens. Next time I will try for something a little lighter. Maybe a salad, soup and a half portion of the pasta. Service attentive, we were there on a Monday night in May, so not too busy.  Other customers seemed to be regulars and they did a surprising amount of take out while we were there. From one of the dining rooms we were able to see into the kitchen. The chef smiled and waived. I always enjoy seeing the cook. Decor appears to be provincial\nItalian w costumer pictures and murals on the walls and ceramic tile on the floor white table cloths lighting was medium and music at good conversational volume. I bet this place could be pretty busy Thursday-Saturday.","29":"We chose Trattoria Totaro on the recommendation\/suggestion of my daughter who had dined here recently for a family dinner to celebrate our son and daughter-in-law moving.  There were five of us with one gluten free eater.  It is a BYO so we brought wine and our server took good care of opening and serving it.\nThere are quite a number of wonderful sounding dishes, most with home made pasta, We all loved our choices including appetizers of calimari and roasted pear salad.  The gluten free person was very happy with his vegetable lasagna layered with risotto instead of pasta and shrimp on top.  Shrimp Fra Diablo kept two more lifting their forks with pleasure and lastly the Rigatoni Alio Olio with home made pasta substituted for the riggies was wonderful.  Some came home with us from the generous portions,  The deserts were delish (canolis and blueberry crumble, home made and warm) and again generous portions.  We will be back.\nIt is an unassuming little corner place on quiet Spring Mill Ave,  Charming and comfortable. Give it a try.","30":"This is a really great intimate spot with incredible food and really great service! A hidden gem! Victoria was our server and she was really great as well. I highly recommend this spot!","31":"Make your own salad or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own sandwich or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own plate of food from various pre-made options like you're at Whole Foods (or Central Market, for my Texas friends - geez, I miss Central Market and HEB. Sorry, sidetracked)? Something for everyone. Healthy eaters? Options. Picky eaters? Options. \n\nI decided against their tasty sounding salads and sandwiches to try some of the pre-made options. I got some simply baked salmon, some kale salad, and some pesto grilled peaches. All of it was pretty good. They also have lots of options for snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. \n\nYou go order what you want, they give you a ticket (or tickets if you go to two different lines or if you're paying for more than one person), and then they ring you up at the registers closer to the entrance. \n\nThey also serve breakfast (I'll be back), and have a bar where you can order beer, wine, or coffee. (I got a cappuccino to go - very good.) \n\nC&B is another new Nashville spot that is trying really hard to be cool. High, high ceilings, white paint everywhere, so bright and airy you feel like you're in an aviary. Chairs that are beautiful but WILL leave a gorgeous geometric pattern in your legs and butt. I don't mind this as long as 1) the food is actually good, and 2) the prices aren't quadruple what they should be because you're paying for the decor. C&B isn't cheap. But overall, I liked the experience and the food.\n\nParking is rough, but there's a garage for the building just to the right of the entrance to C&B, and they validate for 1 hour (possibly during certain hours only, so I'd check that). I stayed for longer than an hour, so I paid $3 when I left the garage. \n\nEating at C&B felt like eating in a cafeteria at a fancy museum in NYC. That's good, right?","32":"This is my favorite BYOB restaurant. Get the Veal Vivian (I get extra homemade pasta) it's absolutely delicious. The specials are always on point too. The chef\/Most Interesting Man in the World has mastered the art of making sauces. I seriously can't say enough good things about this place. Just go and take plenty of wine. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you'll be eating. \n\nThe only turnoff is the pic of Hillary Clinton. Lol","33":"So excited for this new place! Everything is amazing and the food is always great! Only suggestion - anything you might get heated (hot\/warmed items) order toward the end of your wandering around - they should have a small microwave available for guests - as sometimes at lunch the line to pay moves quickly but many people at once, and food looses temperature while finding a spot to sit. Beautiful aesthetics - love that there is indoor and outdoor seating - even at busiest lunch times, i haven't had to \"wait\" for a table. Also great they offer soy \/ almond and coconut milk product options for coffee, and lots of healthy and vegetarian \/ vegan options throughout! Also if you park in the garage next door - they validate for 1 hour ($3 saved max).","34":"So if you ever wanted to know what the Philadelphia area is all about by exploring it's people and food and only have 90 minutes to do so? Well, you have found its best possibility. \nDonna and Vince started this place about 20 years ago as take out and 10 years ago started seating people and it's pure perfection. \nFamily run and operated, this hand crafted Italian restaurant is easily the Top 5 Italian places in Philadelphia. \nBYOB, the bread is freshly made 1 block away and Heavenly, Vince takes the reigns from there and you'll be glad he does with such quality and obvious love put into his dishes from appetizer to entr\u00e9e. \nI have grown up in the Philly area and have been lucky enough to dine at such praised locations like Victors, Four Seasons, Tre Scalini, Le Bec-Fin ect, ect...\nGreat atmosphere, warm and friendly staff with wonderful food, and BYOB to boot.","35":"40 of us descended on the place after a workout. Was absolutely excellent. The food was perfect and well prepared. It would make any alterations you requested in the menu. The service was terrific. There was a bit of a wait but really 40 of us what would you expect. I don't know what's going on in the neighborhood. Its a breath of fresh air. The food portions were perfect to keep one in line with a good healthy meal. bar was refilled and refilled and refilled.\nAlso the cost wasn't much more than they paid for at a fast establishment like Starbucks. And the quality was Immaculately superbly better..\nThis may be our go-to place after a hard workout.\nYMMV... BUT OURS WAS SUPERB","36":"Cool new and shiny building, good atmosphere and pretty good for kids. Sitting was a little rough especially at the lunch hour. The whole cafeteria layout was confusing. It was hard to figure out where to sit, what to get and where to pay.  I had he chicken wrap and my partner had the duck sand which. Both were okay. But for 10.50 I'd like them bigger and with chips or a side. I want more than some thing I could get elsewhere. There was a whole coffee bar and dessert bar. It looked good but I was still underwhelmed by my lackluster sandwich I decided to go elsewhere. \n\nThe final kicker. No sign telling you to validate parking so on top of paying 22 bucks for two sandwiches I could have gotten at subway, I got stiffed for another 3 bucks. (I know they can't control the parking, but a sign or instructions to validate would have been nice)","37":"Excellent authentic Italian food. House-made pasta, flavorful authentic dishes... Fantastic! The desserts are worth saving room for (if you can)! The ambiance is so-so--the restaurant is small and somewhat cramped, but clean, functional, and adequately lit. It may take a while to get your food if it's busy, but they will keep you happy with freshly baked bread and house-made olive oil. Reservations are required to get into this gem. I highly recommend this restaurant.","38":"After seeing some seriously beautiful interior photos from Eater and Yelp, I was waiting for the right opportunity to give Caviar & Bananas a shot, and was happy I decided to come in on a Sunday for brunch. \nIt was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee\/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). \nHowever, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. \nWe had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.","39":"Went here last week for my Dad's surprise 60th birthday. My mom was very excited as the two of them have had great experiences there in the past and it's a BYOB (maybe that's what I was excited about?). My brothers and I showed up to ensure that everything was set up, wine\/beers were prepared, and our family members were greeted and parked discreetly. First, my brother and I had to scramble to find a marker and cross off the tacky price-per-person listed on the bottom of each pre-fixe menu (yes it was $50 a head but no you don't need know that is what we are paying for you to celebrate my dad's birthday). My 3 little nieces and nephews who can't drink and my grandpop who doesn't drink were not offered sodas\/juices which was weird to me - what 10 year old just wants water? \n\nThe menu said we would receive an antipasta plate with artichokes, and asparagus. No artichokes, no asparagus. Salad course was a fine option - fruit\/nut salad, Caesar, some other fruit\/nut combo salad (garden or Italian salad with gorgonzola lovers, look elsewhere). For dinner, I chose the salmon & crab scampi. The salmon was very good but the crab scampi\/pasta was swimming in oil. And not the good garlicky-buttery-oily sauce that we know and love with our scampi...just EVOO - drippy and...just not good. Lastly, the anticipated dessert course. I was going to have a custom made Phillies shirt cake for my Dad for his birthday but the menu listed the family style dessert as, \"Family Style dessert sampler featuring our homemade cakes, bread puddings, cannolies and other specialty desserts.\" so I though another cake would be way too much. Boy was I wrong. 3 \"samplers\" came out on regularly sized entree plates with 1 small slice (not a huge chunk I was expecting from back in the Viggiano's days) of chocolate cake, 1 very watery cannoli, and 3 cookies. Yes. Cookies. For adults. Not biscotti. Chocolate chip or sugar cookies. My 11 year old nephew was ecstatic - the rest of us? Underwhelmed and unsatisfied. \n\nI am wondering if Trattoria is too small to handle a large party (17 of us total) at one time - maybe going in small groups is the better way to go. Our servers were phenomenal and the chef poked his head out of the kitchen to say hello a few times and he was a genuinely nice man, but I can say I will not be bringing anyone back to Trattoria for a large group. My Father had a great time and surprised which is what was most important. However, when I am back in my hometown of Conshohocken, I'll stick to Pepperoncini's for my Italian upscale fix.","40":"The vibe of the space is great.  The food?  Meh.  I've eaten here three times now.  Omelets have been dry and uneventful.  The food (I've had) in general wasn't very good.  I think if they added a great chef and dialed in the training in the kitchen, this place would be amazing.  Also, don't serve your food on paper plates.","41":"Excellent!!!   We went without a reservation and they found a table for us in their tiny, no frills restaurant.    They make up for it with amazing food!!!    The homemade dipping oil-so good! I had alfredo with shrimp and Sun dried tomatoes.  He had a veal dish.   Honestly you won't be disappointed!","42":"A quick walk from my office at Vandy Caviar & Bananas has a very fine selection of fare that apparently switches up from time to time based on the chef(s) call for.  I highly recommend this place for a lunch meeting!","43":"Best place for sushi.  The chop chop cones and the California rolls are amazing!!  One of our go to places for sushi in Edmonton for sure.  Try to make your reservations early.  The restaurant gets full early.","44":"I absolutely love this BYO. Working near by I get takeout delivered to my office all of the time! Their sandwiches are the best in the area. For dinner, their Veal chop is incredible. Also, we just held a cocktail party here. For $15 per person the food was to die for! A fav for sure!","45":"wow good food but    lousy service,counter people rude and delivery is the worst.then they lie to you.   really bad bad bad bad","46":"The decor is beautiful and I could spend hours with coffee working here. However, the servers all seem confused, the flow for ordering is a bit awkward, and the brunch food isn't great. \nWe ordered biscuits and Tasso gravy, the sweet potato and kale hash, pancakes, and coffee. Conceptually, the entire menu sounds fantastic. In reality, the execution isn't there. With a stronger kitchen crew, real plates and forks (it's all paper and plastic - hugely wasteful), and some team leadership in the front of house, I think it could be a huge hit!","47":"Been going to this place for years. Quality of sushi is always consistent. The best sushi in town! Although sometimes they turn away take out orders cause they are so busy. But I will always continue to go back.","48":"Only giving four stars solely for the price. If you're a boujie Nashvillian who can afford a $15 salad, go there every day. All the ingredients are delicious and fresh, which I assume is why it's so expensive. It's the perfect little place to meet for coffee, a lunch meeting or just get some work done while enjoying a latte or glass of wine. \n\nI wouldn't use the \"market\" of it as much as I use the bakery and salad\/sandwich bar. Food is great, employees are nice and it seems well run. The manager is always visible, polite and helping out where is needed. I will be back many times, but have to budget around pay day ;)","49":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! The staff and service was amazing! There's a great selection of dishes to choose from and desserts were delicious as well! I can't wait to go back again!! It is a small place but worth it for a night out with friends or a date night to take advantage in bringing your own wine to go with great food!","50":"I've only eaten here for lunch, as I work in the area, but live in NYC.  The food here is great (They could make a killing up in NYC), service is great.  D\u00e9cor is a bit rustic, and a step \"down\" from the few Michelin 3 stars I've eaten at, but I prefer it that way (you don't eat the d\u00e9cor - and you don't need a jacket and tie) \n\nWhat would I change?  Not a  thing (unless you could figure out how to deliver to Bayside Queens in 45 minutes or less)   \n\nYes, they can get busy.  If you try and place a lunch special at 2:00pm, you might get a \"let me check with the kitchen if we have that left\" if they had a run on a particular special\n\nAt the office, we have a saying, if in doubt, order the Ciabatta special.  They are THAT good, every day","51":"We had a funeral dinner planned and there was a miscommunication about the date. But the restaurant really stepped up and did a fantastic job serving us. Will definitely be back!","52":"Great food and atmosphere. The staff is wonderful and friendly. Had the pork chop and risotto. Dessert was a lemon cake that was awesome. I'd definitely dine here again!","53":"My usual sushi spot is on Whyte, but with Sushi Wasabi closer to home and the winter weather so cold, we decided to give this place a try.\n\nI have driven past this place many times so it was nice to finally stop in for dinner.  I was surprised at how busy it was.  Sure it was during the xmas holidays, but it was also a monday night - and the joint was almost filled to capacity.  \n\nThe waitress was super friendly and attentive which was great.  We ordered what we thought would be enough, but after the initial meal added another round - so was great that she was on top of it.\n\nThe rice was well done - a bit sticky and perfect for rolls.  The fish was flavourful, tasty and fresh.  I'd say it was a bit pricey, but if you need a sushi fix and on the southside, it is well worth checking out Sushi Wasabi.","54":"I went in today and tried the make your own Sandwich Bar. The sandwich was delicious I got the pork belly the only thing I needed was some salt otherwise an excellent sandwich a little pricey but sometimes I'm worth it. Nice selection of gourmet food and wine a much-needed addition to Nashville.  Very friendly staff","55":"my girlfriend and I were right outside Philly for a wedding. Neither of us are big fans of urban sprawl or the food that comes with it so for dinner friday night we took to yelp. I found trattoria and liked what other reviewers had said and the photos of the food looked great so we checked it out. \n\nUnfortunately its BYOB and not being from the area we didn't really know where to go to grab a bottle of wine. So... that sucked. What is up with PA liquor laws?! \n\nIn anycase, the restaurant is small and unassuming in a kind of obscure feeling part of town. But thats good in my opinion. It was loud and had a lot of energy in there which immediately makes me feel like its authentic italian. \n\nThe staff was pretty friendly and relatively attentive. I think the lack of wine made us feel like we were waiting longer than we were in-between someone coming to check on the table. \n\nThe kitchen is small so between sitting down and actually eating we had to wait a whole hour. Thats really the only negative mark I'd give this place. And honestly, if we had wine it wouldn't have been a big deal. Sitting, talking, drinking... thats all good. but we did start to feel like it was a bit long of a wait. \n\nThe food however, wow. It was amazing. I got a shrimp and crab lump pasta, and she got a ravioli and they were both on point. True homemade italian. I've never had any better. \nI've also never had a better cannoli. really really good food all the way around. \n\nSo overall, if we find ourselves back in philly we will be sure to pick up a nice bottle of wine and on a night where we can sit and relax and not be rushed we will head over to this place for the best italian food we've ever found.","56":"Have been wanting to come here for a long time, finally got around to it and was a little disappointed. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was nice but it took over an hour to get our appetizer.  Must have been a off night.","57":"Just moved to Edmonton after living in San Francisco Bay Area for 4 years. Was looking for some good sushi hat might compare, but was skeptical. After a bit of research (reddit mostly), tried this place out. It did not disappoint. Japanese-owned. Wow best sushi rice I've had... ever? Great tasting fish. \nWe had: tekka don w\/ tuna, veggie and shrimp tempura, hamachi & toro nigiri, and #7 combo. \nNo complaints all around. Definitely will be back.","58":"A little pricey, but damn fine food. I went here on an afternoon with a couple of dogs (They are pet friendly as long as you are outside!). They take their time crafting the cuisine they serve. The bread is always fresh.\n\nI had a steak with caramelized onions and blue cheese. It was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. My girlfriend had a cheese ravioli which was immaculate and my dad had mussels and clams with spaghetti he would not stop raving about.\n\nIt is a bit out of the way from 76, but there is plenty of street parking. If you're looking for a quaint little restaurant that treats you like family, come here.","59":"Hummmm.......can't decide if I will return here or not. Parked in parking garage and paid $9 for 2 hrs. , so there's that. Line for brunch food was long and moved very slow, very slow.  We had a group of 8 and had to sit in the hot humidity outdoors to find enough tables to pull together. When the crowd thinned out, and sweat was pouring, we all moved inside. It was so noisy inside that we could only visit with the person right beside us.  The iced tea was good (but refills cost and again you have to wait in a long line to pay for that!) as were the sandwiches and chips. The Frose was  basically frozen Rose wine and was nice but small and expensive for what you get.  So, I'm on the fence....sad that I have to choose a not busy time to want to come back!","60":"Really enjoying this new find for breakfast. While it is rapidly becoming our new \"go to\" for breakfast, it does not come without some flaws. \n\nThe French Press coffee for 2 works well. Good flavor while being nice and hot. Enjoyed  the hash with a poached egg on it. My husband loves the breakfast burrito with avocado, egg, chorizo, cheese and potato.\n\nWe strive to find dog friendly, outside areas with shade and this is about as good as it gets in town. Rarely do we have to wait for a table and all outside tables are shaded. \n\nThe downsides- paper plates and plastic utensils..... I am not a prude but this just makes less formal and delish-- also we talked to the manager about the coffee mugs. There is absolutely no way to carry this mug OR drink from it without burning your fingers. We even had the manager try it.  He absolutely agreed and said he would replace them immediately. Nope--- nothing yet and we now wrap our fingers in napkins to protect them.","61":"Okay, I have stopped eating right now, just to write a review. You have to come here. Amazing food and a BYOB? You should be here tonight. I have been here twice in the same week. Yes, you have to wait for your food, it takes time to make a wonderful meal, so sit back, enjoy the wine you brought and actually talk to the person you are sitting next to. Enjoy the evening and your company and come to this place. Comfort food! By the by, eating the vegetable lasagna with crab. Really.... Amazing.","62":"I live right around the corner, literally, and I went for the first time tonight. I had a great meal and wonderful time. I got the vegetarian lasagna with crab and my boyfriend got the veal special. Both were delicious. For me the real highlight was the appetizer. We got the eggplant with the duck in it (can't remember the name for the life of me) but I would make a meal out of that if I could! BYO was a nice option and I would highly recommend this place to anyone!","63":"Came on a Sunday for brunch. First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.\n\nOrdered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty.  While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.\n\nThe chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. \n\nParking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal. Just be prepared to drop some cash. $13\/pound under 3 lbs of purchase for the prepared foods. $11\/lb if over 3 lbs. Whole foods and Turnip Truck is almost half this price for the prepared foods. \n\nMaybe dinner would be a better experience?","64":"The store itself was beautiful, clean, and spacious. We ordered at the sandwich station and the gentlemen told us where to go to pay, which was so helpful as first timers. The turkey\/apricot sandwich and Cuban sandwich were delicious. The dessert, charcuterie selection and wine area were awesome. \n\nThe zucchini sandwich, however, was really disappointing. As (I believe) the only vegetarian sandwich on the menu it should consist of more than just zucchini and cheese on thin bread. I would equate it to a \"tea sandwich\" or finger sandwich. It absolutely needs something else on it or at least heartier bread. \n\nI agree with a prior comment that all the sandwiches are on the small side and should come with a deli side or chips considering the cost.","65":"Decided to go see the new C & B.  I have been to the one in Charleston.  Beautiful interior.  A little confusing as to \"what is where\".  Did not eat but bought some pastries.  My only real complaint is the parking.  There is none.  You have to park in the garage set aside for the apartments.  The apartments are not yet occupied, but I still had to drive to the 3rd floor and try to fit into a parking space that was designed for a Mini Cooper.  There was one small elevator which never arrived, so I walked the three levels.  I can't imagine how parking will be once the apartments, hotel and other retail stores are open.  This is not a knock on the restaurant but getting in to eat or buy food is not going to be easy.  It's just another example of the unchecked Nashville growth getting in the way of good planning.","66":"Been going here for about 10 years. Their sandwiches are awesome. It's hard to find a pizza place that makes a good hoagie that's filled with meat. This place has it. I'm not crazy about the plain and pepperoni pizza but when it comes to speciality pizza it's very good compared to local pizza places. I've been to them all and Roma is the place I go to for a good sandwich\/wrap with fries. I've never had one bad experience after all of these years.","67":"Really neat concept!  There is a small gourmet grocery. A soup and sandwich station, a salad station and a combination beer, wine and coffee bar.  Loved the frozen rose! They also have caviar plates and cheese plates to share.","68":"As I sit on my couch, a little more than 12 hours after consuming a simple meal of assorted tempura, spicy octopus maki and spicy tuna maki with my husband, my insides are expressing displeasure and defiance after ingesting this meal.\nThe place is quaint, clean, and our waitress was very friendly.  We requested to \"start\" with the assorted tempura....didn't happen.  The rolls were brought out first and my husband made the comment \"boy, do these ever smell fishy.\"  Granted we were in a sushi restaurant, fish isn't supposed to smell as fishy as it did, indicating to me that it may not have been as fresh as it should be for sushi.  We ate it anyways...and I'm sure the spices in the mix camouflaged any distaste I would have otherwise experienced.\nThe tempura arrived when we were already halfway through our makis, but whatever, it arrived hot.  The shrimp tempura could have been cooked slightly longer as it wasn't very crispy and almost a bit soggy.  The oil needed to be changed as well...  I was up a lot in the night with reflux and heartburn from the tempura, something which I rarely ever have\nFor drinks, I had green tea and my husband had the hot sake.\nUnfortunately, we will not be returning to this restaurant.\nI wish I could have given it a better review, but I'd rather be honest than not...","69":"So we came here on a whim around 7pm on a Thursday evening and because we didn't have a reservation we wound up sitting at the bar.  This place is hopping - make reservations!\n\nThe bar was totally fine and service was super fast and friendly.  The food is great value for what you pay for and their sashimi was fantastic!  Their rolls are your basic sushi rolls, no attempts at recreating new\/modernized rolls. The veggies were all super fresh too.  Our teapot was always full so that was really nice too - despite how busy they were they were def taking care of their customers.\n\nTotally worth checking out!","70":"FROZEN ROS\u00c9 | PERFECT FOR INSTAGRAMS | FREE WATER @ ENTRANCE | MANY OPTIONS | AVERAGE FOOD | \nCaviar & Bananas has a very urban feel. They have a design your own salad counter, a soups and sandwiches counter, and a bakery\/coffee counter, as well as many shelves around the restaurant with a plethora of drink options. Then you get a ticket, and take it to the bakery\/coffee counter to pay. I ordered the French Dip Sandwich and was fairly unhappy with my sandwich. I got a bottled water from the refrigerated shelves, but found FREE WATER by the ENTRANCE!! All of the bakery items looked pretty good to me, but we didn't try any. There were a mix of college students and business men & women during lunch. This place was very aesthetically pleasing! Adorable gold chairs, mini cacti on each table, pretty art, and more. They also had many many wine options including a frozen ros\u00e9!","71":"Came here for lunch and loved how this cafe\/market is set up! It's perfect for any meal and looks to have a great take out option. Items are fairly priced and are super fresh. \n\nI had the toscana salad and it was wonderful! I am super intrigued by the frozen rose and will be back to try it. \n\nSuper happy about this addition in Nashville!","72":"Good food and good location in my opinion.  Tucked away in Conshy away from hustle and bustle of Fayette St.   Lobster Ravioli was on special as an appetizer and main course.  We (party of 8) got a few apps including the lobster rav and it was very good.  I got the Osso buco and it was fall-off-the-bone tender, perfect.  I also ordered a side of homemade pasta in Marinara.  The homemade pasta didn't blow me a way but was tasty nonetheless.  Service was excellent, I checked in on Yelp and got free canloli for the entire table!  BYOB so it was not too expensive.  I will be returning...","73":"Been here a few times but won't go back. Yes, the sushi is good (for Edmonton, which is a sad but necessary qualifier) but the service is so poor. \n \nYes, its a tiny restaurant, but there's no need to seat you next to the toilets or right next to another table, when the restaurant is empty and you've called ahead for a reservation.\n\nYou could try ordering take-out ... but be prepared to be quoted more than an hour for your order to be ready.\n\nAs a city, we need to stop accepting poor, pretentious and untimely service!!","74":"I've been to the C & B in Charleston, but last night was my first time in the Nashville location.  \nI will never go back.\n\nFirstly, the space is inconveniently laid out.   I had to go to three different stations to order what I wanted, and then go to yet a fourth station to pay.  Maybe it's possible to have some communication between the serving stations and the coffee bar, so I can order coffee from the food station, and go to the coffee station to pick it up, instead of having to wait in line again to order coffee?\n\nBut that is not the reason I will not go back.\nThe food I had was all very good, and it's a nice-looking, clean place.\nThe service, however, was the most insulting and rudest and hostile I've encountered in a long time.\n\nMany of the items in the cold prepared food section were not labeled, so I told the man behind the counter that I was a vegetarian, and wanted to make up a plate of a few items that didn't have meat, eggs, seafood, etc.     I asked him what items were vegetarian, and he growled at me and said \"just tell me what you want\" in an incredibly rude and hostile manner.   I assumed, thusly, that he would steer me away from any items that weren't vegetarian.   I pointed to one item, and asked if if were vegetarian.  He said \"how much you want,\" hostile and rudely, like I was wasting his time.   I said a spoon.  He put a spoon's worth on the plate.  I pointed to another item, and asked \"how about that?\" and he said, again, \"just tell me what you want\" in such a hostile way, I was really taken aback.  He was surly and beyond rude.  He made no effort to mask a nasty and rude temperament. Every time I tried to confirm that an item was vegetarian, he would just say \"tell me how much you want.\" I finally said to him that I thought he was being unnecessary hostile and rude and not helpful.    \n\nI left it at that, and went to pay.  One bite into my dish, however, I tasted shrimp.  I went back to the counter, and asked him what the salad was. He said shrimp salad.  I  asked him why he would give me that after I repeatedly told him that I was a vegetarian, and he just glared at me.    \n\nI asked to speak to the manager, who was the other man behind the food station.   I told the manager that his server was rude to me, and the manager said \"I don't think he was.\"\nWHAT?\nI was stunned.  \nYou know what, Mr Manager? I don't care what you think.  Your job is customer service, and to find out why the customer felt he had a terrible experience.\nDid you do that?\nNo. \nYou immediately sided with the server, without having any idea what transpired between us.  The restaurant was noisy, the server's back was to the manager, and there is no way on earth that the manager could have heard what his server said to me, or the tone in which he said it. \nNone.  \nYet, he sided with the server instead of finding out what happened?!?\nHe also did not offer to refund the cost of the shrimp salad that I asked him to remove from my plate.\n\nPerhaps non-vegetarians might not empathize with my anger, or think I'm overreacting, but if you are a vegetarian of long standing and mistakenly eat meat because of someone else's incompetence and hostility, I think you will understand how angry I was.\n\nI asked for the rude server's name, but the manager would not give it to me.  When he saw how angry I was, he finally tried to be friendly and very insincerely conciliatory,  but I told him it was too late.   He had a chance to find out what the problem was, but, instead, he quickly defended his worker and told me, essentially, that I was wrong.\nThe manager needs to learn to listen to all sides of a story, and to show some concern for a customer's complaints before telling the customer that he is wrong.  \nWhen he finally wanted to listen, it was too little, too late.\nAnd the server needs to understand that it is the customers' business that allows the corporation to pay his wages, and he best be polite to ensure that they come back.\nI will not ever be treated that badly and rudely.\n\nI recognize and can overlook that people are not always in the happiest mood, and I can overlook occasional surliness, but the manager's and the server's attitudes were both beyond the pale, and I can not condone a manager who told me that I was wrong, before he even knew what his server said and the manner in which he said it.\nI always thought the customer was right.  Apparently, that is not a lesson they teach at C & B.","75":"So awesome! Love the vibes and the food! \n\nI had an amazing matcha latte. I will be back!","76":"I don't really get why some 'locals' love this place so much. The 'pizza' is not really that great. The last time I was here, I ordered a buffalo pizza and was very disappointed. The slices are very thin and even the presentation of the toppings and sauce made it look like a frozen pizza. In fact, it tasted exactly like the pizza I bought from a stand in The Gallery food court a few weeks prior. Even the adjacent  Wegmans grocery store makes a much better pizza. May be okay for sandwiches, but if you are looking for a good pie, go somewhere else.","77":"I went here a while back in December. Sushi wasabi is a the right place to go if you want authentic sushi. Unfortunately thought, since this place is very authentic there is not many unique choices of maki rolls to choose from. For example, like dragon rolls, deep fried rolls, etc. I love sushi is the place to go if you want more unique rolls, which is also not authentic. However thought, the sashimi was very fresh and tasted better than most sushi restaurants I've been to. I enjoyed the tempura rolls the most, I recommend it. The reason I'm giving this a 4\/5 is because although the food is very fresh and authentic, it does not have many of the deep fried rolls and variety of sushi I could choose from.","78":"My wife and I stopped by here for their Wild Game Night dinner last night, it was my first time eating here, and my wife's second. We had a generally positive experience. Although this is a BYOB, the dinner event included a paired beer from Conshohocken Brewery with each course, provided by staff from the brewery. For $55 a person, we each had a high quality five course meal and five 6-8oz glasses of great beer that paired well with the food. The rabbit and pumpkin stew that started the meal off was a favorite, although it could have been served slightly warmer. The pasta course included pumpkin ravioli with wild boar andoule sausage, which was also amazing. Not all courses were pumpkin-oriented but those were my favorites.\n\nThe atmosphere is generally casual to dressy. It is a small space and can get noisy, given that it's \"cozy\" your experience will probably depend on your fellow diners.\n\nThe only real negative was that the service staff was a little disconnected. Our food was plopped in front of us without any real acknowledgement before they turned away and headed somewhere else. I'm not the type of person who requires a server to dote on my hand and foot, but for a special event dinner it's always nice to have a quick explanation of what the dish was so we didn't have to constantly refer to the menu. This was contrasted by the Conshohocken Brewery staff who did a good job of serving the beer, explaining what to look for in the style being served, and why they paired it with that dish.","79":"It seems like the employees still don't know what's going on. They have 'organic seasonal smoothie' on the menu. The gentleman at the register didn't know what fruit they have. He came back and told me it was either strawberries or mango (neither is in season, obviously). I picked mango, and it was the most disgusting, sugar-filled drink I have had. Moreover, it gave me stomach ache for the rest of the day. Left really bad taste in my mouth. \n\nThe coffee tastes great but they are incredibly slow.","80":"Had a very dissapointing experience here on Saturday.  Which is a shame since the food was good.  I see the noise level is described here as loud, but our party was told we were too loud.  The owner\/chef decided to wait until we were done our meal - which took a lot longer since one of our party didn't receive her meal until the rest of us were finished(!). \nSince the owner felt comfortable enough to rudely communicate his unhappiness to us - I'm suprised he wasn't a smart enough business owner to come out earlier and communicate his unhappiness in a nicer way.  When we asked for our check it took them another 10 minutes (and it was incorrect) even though they said they were in a rush to get us out.  \nReally disappointed that a business owner decides to run his business this way.","81":"Serves authentic Japanese food - but in small portions and highly over priced.  If this is not an issue then try it. There are other places that serves the same but not as pricey as this one.","82":"Great ambiance and even better food.  The filet is excellent and there marinara Sauce is delicious.  Highly recommend.","83":"Ordered delivery the other night; two sandwiches, fries, and sodas. The food took over an hour to arrive (the driver couldn't find our house), one hot wing sandwich didn't have the blue cheese dressing we requested, our sodas were completely watered down from melted ice, and our french fries were stale. When I called Roma to say something, the owner\/chef yelled at me, insisting he made the food himself and told us it would be at least 45 minutes for delivery. So much for \"The customer is always right.\" Avoid at all costs.","84":"I wanted to like this place sooo bad because it's SO beautiful!! But the food was just okay and expensive for what you got. I had a the pimento cheese BTL.","85":"We have been their regular customers for years, I would say at least a decade.  We started to go to Wasabi when our children were little.  We did try other japanese restaurants but we always ended going back to Wasabi. Wasabi never fail us. Their foods always the top notch and we never once feel disappointed. Their beef tataki is the BEST. We must have our own plate of beef tataki because we don't want to share...lol.  I personally love their Salmon sashimi. Its always fresh and soft, feel like its melting in your mouth. People here have been saying their price is a bit on the expensive side but you get what you pay for.  This is an authentic Japanese restaurant.  Reservation is recommended.","86":"I was at this place last week and anything I say about this place would be less. Right from the ambiance, to the multiple vegetarian options in the menu and to the hostess, everything about this place was great.\nThe hostess thoroughly knew what vegetarian means and hence knew minute details like vegetarians cannot have Caesar dressing in the salad as it has anchovy. Her precise comment was  \"After not eating meat for whole life, I don't want you to accidentally eat anchovy\". That is as good as it can get.\nBut all other things about this place was awesome too. The menu was great and the dish came out to be delicious.\nAnd did I mention the murals, even those were awesome. Gives the place nice ethnic Italian look and feel.\nI am definitely visiting this place again...whenever I am in town.\nLast but not least, cheers to the complimentary Sangria.... hic hic..","87":"Food could have been good. service was the absolute worst. Went with a group of four. We called ahead to make a reservation for Friday. They asked us to do a little later then we asked, and we did. \n\nThe biggest issue was that we were seated around 8:15 and did not receive our meal until close to 10. Yes 1 hour and 45 minutes waiting for dinner. When we got it, one meal was cold,  and one was burnt. We would have walked out and left, but our friends were on their last night here before traveling home and we had heard the food was really good, instead we were disappointed. We also saw a cat run into the kitchen after we finally got our meal. 10 minutes at best after our food was served, they started to clear our plates. My food was still too hot to put in my mouth and the waitress hovered behind me trying to take my plate. \n\nWe were mostly ignored, while we waited. no one stopped to ask how we were or if we needed anything, like glasses, water, or a cork screw. We arrived before a second group of four people.  As we were about to be seated, this group arrived and were seated before us. We noted that the second group had their photo on the wall.We didn't think anything of it until they put us in front of an ac unit. Our table was set for 2 and remained that way until we had to ask piecemeal for the items missing, can we have water, can we have napkins, etc.","88":"Best sushi ever! I went there for my bday and I had amazing food\/service. I was so happy I bought a grift certificate for my boyfriend's parents.","89":"I really love this brunch place, I've been twice. Only for brunch on Saturdays. They have a reat staff and neat location. Its conviently located near Vanderbilt. They have a great selection of foods and deserts, also its a very upscale version of Puckett's. They sell wine and other goodies. I'm making it a point to come back and try the rest of the selection. Definitely recommend this place for brunch, good for one on ones or big groups.","90":"Best gluten free sandwiches around here! I need to know where I can get the bread because holy cow is it a dream! The salads are definitely premium caviar quality, they taste fantastic and would recommend you try both the salad bar and the custom sandwich\/deli! Seriously dream about the gluten free bread.","91":"In love!!! I loved the build your own salad! Got exactly what I wanted and super healthy and fresh. My mom got a sandwich that was equally delicious. It was a little confusing to figure out what it was and how to order but after we figured that our food was really good. The staff was nice. Really liked the concept.  The one thing I wished they had was fountain drinks instead of bottles.","92":"Eggs over medium where cold and NOT cooked right. Overall food was bad. However, the atmosphere is what you pay for and the architecture is pretty.","93":"Good sushi but I've never waited so long for food. It took an hour and fifteen minutes after being seated to receive any food, and we had a reservation. They also forgot some of our order and we had to wait again while one person at our table had no food for so long. We were close to walking out and many people came and went with take out orders. Seems like the priority went to take out and not the people who were sitting and waiting and made reservations. No apologies from the staff either. Going here was an annual family tradition so we'll probably pick somewhere new next time or do the take out. Too bad, it was pretty yummy.","94":"I was here on a date with my fiancee recently. It was my first visit. I'd definitely classify this as an old-school Italian neighborhood gem. The food was outstanding with good, attentive service. The room we dined in had murals on the walls, which made for some nice ambiance. The fact that its a BYOB makes it even better since you don't get clubbed over the head for a bottle of wine. It was a great experience and we will definitely be back.","95":"Not even sure how the food tastes. My wife and I went in here hearing it was authentic. After 30 mins and only speaking to our waitress once (who admitted she had ignored us accidentally) we just got up and left. I really wanted to try this place but after waiting 30 mins and not even taking our order I couldn't tolerate it any longer.","96":"BARFFFFF......Horribly over priced, not tasty with AWFUL customer service..here's the email I sent to them: I wanted to share my dining experience with you...in hopes that you can do better to the next customer. I can kinda understand, at an airport you don't get a lot of repeat customers....please verify my email with your manager on duty...\n#1 - ordered a cheese steak - you were out of Kaiser  rolls, not the end of the world but you were also out a cheese that a gentleman ordered on his salad and some thing else the lady behind me ordered\n#2 after looking around at other dining options I came back and ordered a roast beef sandwich...2 workers were in the back for minutes...when some one \nfinally came out she made my sandwich and gave it t the wrong person...I said to the employee I thin you just gave my sandwich to someone else...she said \"it's dirty back here I don't know what ticket that was\". So she reluctantly and made my sandwich and the kicker to this evening was she almost threw the sandwich at me and said 'here you go\" as if she was bothered by the fact that I ordered food from your establishment. \n\nI was absolutely disgusted at the fact that you were nearly out of everything then after I came back I was treated as if your company did me a favor after screwing up the order then finally making the sandwich...by the way it wasn't all that great.\n\nbut please don't take my word...I encourage you to talk to the manger on duty because the young lady who made my sandwich has no business working in front of customers.\n\nHere's to hoping you can offer someone else a better experience. + yelping this.\n\nKate","97":"Great atmosphere and incredible food!! Love that it is byob. We will be coming back here a lot.","98":"Delicious, convenient, and trendy. Caviar and Bananas is a great spot for Vanderbilt students and professionals alike. A variety of different options, with coffee and breakfast offered until 11:30 am and lunch options (salad bar, soups and sandwich station, grocery story, etc). I love their Far East Salad. Completely vegan! Lots of great options for vegans and vegetarians. Plenty of seating and a great space for meeting people, studying, or just chilling. It's adjacent to the Aertson Hotel, so this is a good spot for visitors to the city. Excited to return!","99":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this new restaurant and was very pleasantly surprised. The ambiance and openness is appealing and comfortable. Everyone was very nice and helpful. I had a hodgepodge of food because I was eating with kids but everything was delicious-pimento cheese, cheese plate, chicken tenders, BBQ chicken and a variety of sides. The coffee and wine bar had a great selection. I can't wait to try brunch. This will definitely be a new go to place for me.","100":"The interior of Caviar & Bananas is very aesthetically pleasing but I was underwhelmed by the actual food (I ordered a salad). Because I went on a Saturday, it was very busy and it was a little confusing to figure out where to pay. I really wanted to love it; hopefully I can try it again when it's not so busy.","101":"Absolutely amazing!\nI cannot get enough of this place. It has delicious sashimi and everyone is so polite there. Awesome service! Pretty small restaurant so I would book reservations just in case.","102":"I haven't tried enough food to give a very thorough review, but my experience at the bar was great! I was excited to try the Fros\u00e9, which definitely does the trick but tasted slightly like medicine. I love a dry Ros\u00e9, but I wish they had a sweeter one in the machine. \nMy friend and I shared a few small plates and a cheese & charcuterie board, which was way too much food, but everything we had was great other than the salmon dip, not a lot of flavor. The eggs and wings were awesome! I want to go back and try their salads and the gourmet food. \nMight I add, the atmosphere is fantastic. Grab a few canned Ros\u00e9 from the cooler for $3.99, go hang out at Centennial... made a fantastic day. And it's much cheaper than the $8 glasses they serve in the restaurant.","103":"The breakfast sandwiches my son and I had were quite notable, but the prices will keep me away.","104":"I came here over my lunch break with coworkers and we had a wonderful time. The decor is awesome and we all commented about how much more comfortable this environment was than our hospital cafeteria. We all had sandwiches and they were delicious. Everything was fresh and there were lots of options for chips, drinks and desserts. I'd love to come back to this place again and try the brunch.  It also looked like they had a good selection of wine and beer.","105":"Over priced cafeteria style with wine and charcuterie, sandwiches, salads, breakfast. You wander around, grabbing things, order something, eat ok food, then pay $50 for two people. Not great for kids. My main gripe is the quality of the experience and food for the oversized price.","106":"Came here for breakfast and had high hopes for this place. The space is gorgeous and roomy, which is a nice find in Nashville.\n\nThis isn't a typical sit down restaurant. You order your food and pick it up at the front much like a fast food restaurant. I ordered 2 sandwiches and waited 30+ minutes before the owner finally checked on me. She went around to customers before me and apologized for their wait, offered refunds and free drinks. For me? Nothing. Not an apology. No compensation. I wouldn't complain if I didn't know many other customers received better treatment. The ordering style doesn't appropriate for the wait time you could face. Service was on the slow side for seemingly simple orders. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't remarkable either. I may come back and try their happy hour, but the service today left a bad taste.","107":"We hadn't been here for a few years and though the owners haven't changed, the menu definitely has. They no longer offer yakitori, chicken bits on a stick, as an appetizer. \n\nOne thing that continues to annoy me about this place is the wait persons disregard for our requested appetizers. We specifically asked for three dishes as our appetizers but they showed up at our table willy nilly. We got one person's appetizer, then the sashimi rolls and finally the other two appetizers. I feel this is the servers fault. But it is also management's fault for not training the service staff properly. \n\nWe were not offered hot towels to clean our hands at the beginning of the meal. I don't know if this is due to a change in policy or negligence of the server. \n\nAt any rate, the gyoza got top marks, the octopus balls were okay and a bit of a creepy novelty - see video. The chicken replacement dish was okay, but a bit more meat than I really wanted.  \n\nThe big disappointment of the evening were the California rolls. They were bigger than we usually get and had grapefruit pieces in the centre?!! Weird and hard to manage with chopsticks. The smoked salmon and avocado rolls were perfect and the avocado mushroom rolls were good. The green tea is one of my favourites here.","108":"I called at 704pm and at 8pm was delivered this (photo in gallery) Need I say more? This location is 10 mins away and the delivery man was covered in sweat when giving me the pizza. Don't think I'll be back.","109":"The best employee's name is Mars. He works at the espresso counter. He's the reason why I keep coming back. Customer service 100","110":"We have come here several times and while our meals have been good, the atmosphere and pricing not so much. It's time to update and renovate the restaurant - paint, new tables, sound proofing in the dining areas. Also, we noticed that some items such as the garlic clams are the smallest clams possible,  not worth ordering. Everything tends to have a ton of garlic as well. We would like to go here again, but feel that there are better options.","111":"I was here with my friend just doing some work and studying, and I noticed an elderly man by himself here to have some dinner. He had quite a few things he was trying to carry - dinner plate, side of vegetables, newspaper, and also walk with a cane. It didn't look easy. He sat down and I noticed he wasn't extremely happy with his spot cause of the draft he was feeling. A sweet woman who works here walked over to him and asked if she could help him with anything. As a result, she ended up moving from table to table with this man, carrying his things for him, and helping feel all the tables to see if there was still a windy draft. Once he finally decided on a spot, she smiled completely genuinely and asked if he would like a glass of water - now remember, this isn't a waiter\/waitress based restaurant, she was doing this just to be kind. She brought him water, and when he said his sandwich was too cold, she happily went and heated it up for him. That is the kind of service and genuine kind-heartedness I wish I saw more in the world. Everyone else I encountered here was equally as pleasant. I will definitely come again. And to the woman who did all of this - keep being you!","112":"Tasty! Fish was fresh, tempura cooked to perfection, beek tataki was very good.  Did take out, so can't speak to the service, but it seemed like it would have been very good.\n\nMy only complaint was that it was a little pricey... but I guess we are far enough away from the ocean to justify it for fresh.","113":"Great place to have real Japanese food. Nabe udon is the best! Great owner and great staff. Always busy so make sure to have an appointment if you have time to wait..","114":"Went for breakfast and was delighted by the menu variety, service, and actual space. Would definitely come back!","115":"Went to try this spot for brunch today and was slightly disappointed. I wanted to love it. The inside is really cool and we sat in the cute patio with beautiful weather. Unfortunately, the food was just ehhhhh OK. I had the DYO plate - scrambled eggs that needed seasoning, decent crispy turkey bacon, a yummy biscuit that came with no spread and a mixed fruit that was essentially all cantaloupe. I was expecting a better selection of fruit and my biscuit to come with jelly or butter or something! My friend had the burrito which was a tad dry and they don't have salsa. I would like to come back and try lunch here because it's such a cute setup.","116":"Went here on a first date and it was delicious. I got the Veal Vivian and it was just wonderful.BYOB made it even better! The staff was very nice and made sure everything was perfect. I highly recommend, as I will be going again.","117":"A neighborhood gem that is by far the best Italian BYO in the area.  The restaurant's decor adds to the charm and the food's quality is unmatched.  Note, get the veggie lasagna.  Will definitely be back soon!","118":"Small place but very good food. I used to work near this restaurant and it used to be our \"go to\" place for group lunches. They have free sangriad on certain day of the week that tastes better than the overpriced ones at any other restaurant. The food always very good, everything from their mandarin tilapia salad to sweet potato fries with the special dipping sauce is A++","119":"Love the atmosphere - it's very chic and clean! Croissants are wonderful, ordered a biscuit and bacon, biscuit could have been baked a tad less, but still very good! Will be back! The selection of pastries is incredible!!","120":"Solid byob, great lunch and dinner menu and specials good is always very hood especially forte price.  Service and staff is very friendly, sometimes a little forgetful but good none the less.  For the price a great value, hidden little gem on consh.  Only problem is it is extremely small","121":"Great little unique restaurant. The French Dip is great, along with their entire assortment of bakery items. I loved the setup of the building, where there are different sections for the bakery, sandwiches and salads. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a quick bite or a breakfast snack.","122":"I was visiting from California and found this gem here on Yelp. The food here deliciously delightful and the service exceptional and fun. We had the Grilled Vegetable Lasagna, Lobster Ravioli, Asparagus salad and a special arugula salad. Everything was incredible! Thank you Ali and Donna for making us feel like family! We'll be back!","123":"And it closed.\nI wonder if others had the same horrible experience I did.   I swear I have not had a worse customer experience in a restaurant, ever.","124":"Italian BYOB with nice and cozy atmosphere and very friendly service. As a starter we had fried calamari and prawns with pancetta.  Prawns were ok (cos have been fried a bit shorter) whereas calamari were not really seasoned. Further, Calamari should have been more crisp. For entree we had chicken in gorgonzola sauce and three different pasta dishes with seafood. Chicken was a bit dry but overall ok. However, the risotto that came with the chicken did not deserve the name risotto. It should be called rimasho or so as it came ready to eat for somebody who lost all his teeth. Pasta dishes came with a lot of seafood.  They were quite good but I wouldn't call them authentic. It was a bit annoying that the clams were not properly washed. As we were quite full, we just shared a lava chocolate cake that was very yummy. \n\nOverall a nice place in terms of service and atmosphere. Room for improvement if\nIn the kitchen....","125":"Use to be my favorite pizza joint...pizza from Roma's was a weekly event. However, over the past several months its has gone downhill and we found a  new local pizza shop. Always willing to give a second chance, stopped there with family for a quick slice and was severely disappointed. The slice of pepperoni was tasteless and just downright awful. I ate half and was done...same with the family. Not sure what happened at Roma's, but the za is either way too oily or has no taste...inconsistent product. While it pains me, family pizza night has permanently moved to a different local pizza joint.","126":"Caviar and Bananas - where you get to wait in line twice! If you're getting a salad or sandwich, you wait in line to order it and watch them make it. Then, you get to go to another line, wait some more and eventually pay for it! Such a fun way to spend your lunch hour. At least they validate parking because you've been in there waiting in lines so long -- oh wait, they are out of validation tickets with \"no idea when we'll get more.\" So two lines, mediocre food & service, AND dashed hopes of free parking. At least you're pretty, C&B.","127":"This Italian restaurant is amazing! You can never go wrong with what you order. They have a very large selection to choose from my favorite is the vegetable lasagna! Also the staff is very nice and makes you feel like your at home! It's a must go to and will become your favorite! Plus to top it off it's BYOB!","128":"We heard great things about this place and the reviews were all positive.  So we were excited to give it a try.\n\nWe arrived 10 minuets early for our 7:00 reservation for 6 people and we were seated immediately.  Since it is BYOB we cracked open a bottle of wine. By the time we finished our first glasses, 20 minutes, our menu finally arrived.  Our waitress gave us 2 menus for 6 people. We waited another 10-20 minutes to order our appetizers.   Our appetizers and 4 menus arrived at the same time.  We ate our appetizers with our menus in our laps since our orders still were not taken.  We split $12 shrimp - 3 shrimp arrived, mussels and calamari.  The mussels and calamari were just ok.\n\nFinally we placed our orders.  105 minutes into our meal our food arrived.  My fellow diners were not overwhelmed by our meals.  We asked our waitress what the best sellers were when ordering.  So I went with the waitress suggestion and had the Veal Vivian.  I was shocked how bland it was.   The whole meal tasted like cream.\n\nDessert was also just so-so. When I asked what people felt about the meal, we all said it was ...fine.\n\nThe service as also so-so.  The waitress made the comment that service was a little slow because she didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen staff.  We really had 2 waitress.  1 was polite the other not so much.\n\nAll in all our meal was 3 hours long. I liked not being rushed but it was a little long. With so many good Italian restaurants I wouldn't waste my time.","129":"Maybe the most authentic Japanese experience in Edmonton. The sushi rice is so fresh and packed with flavour.","130":"A friend took me here after having enjoyed many good meals herself. Staff were very friendly and everyone is family, so it adds a nice homey touch. The bread was fresh and delicious. It's a tad pricey, but my meal was solid....goat cheese ravioli. Filling was delish and the ravioli were nicely al dente and made from fresh pasta dough. BYOB is always a plus, too! I'll return with the hubby,  who will want to try one of the many meat entrees.","131":"There is nothing like a first-rate Italian BYOB in New Jersey or Philadelphia. It's even better when you go to a residential neighborhood that's not obvious and get to sit outside. And it's better still when the menu has 20 items you want to order and then the server, whose father owns the place, tells you about the specials. which included a marvelous thick pork chop in marsala wine sauce with risotto. Deb had a seafood pasta Cardinale that was so good she scooped up all the remaining sauce with bread. You may need a GPS to find this spot but do find it. And call to get one of the sidewalk seats.","132":"A little hole in the wall sushi joint. Salmon sashimi was great. Tuna sashimi was awful.\nI've definitely been to better sushi places in Edmonton (better bang for your buck as well)\nIf you want good Salmon sashimi I say go hard. The Bento box is a rip off and almost everywhere on the menu says \"No substitutions\" which I've never had an issue with any where else.","133":"Had dinner there last Saturday night with my husband and another couple.  We had a reservation at 8pm, arrived at 8:05 and had to wait for them to clear and set a table for us.  The waitress promptly opened our bottles of wine and filled our water but did not bring us menus for another 15 minutes.  We placed an appetizer order first at the waitress' suggestion and she didn't return to take our entree order until the appetizers were on the table.  She brought our entrees out and did not return to check on us until most of the table was done eating.  I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and was given a veal dish made with marsala wine, spinach and mushrooms.  When I was finally able to ask the waitress about it, she realized she gave the Saltimbocca to someone else at my table who ate it not realizing the order was wrong.  I had only eaten about a 1\/4 of the dish as I do not like marsala wine and she cleared it away and never offered to bring me what I ordered.  It was late at this point and the kitchen was closing.  One person at our table ordered dessert which was quickly brought out and she dropped the bill, explaining that she gave us the dessert for free since she messed up the entree.  We paid  the bill and sat for another 10 minutes when she came back to the table and reminded us she gave us the dessert for free and then said she forgot to charge us for the appetizers and gave us another bill.  Not sure if I'll return based on how our table was treated.  The appetizers that I ate were decent but I left hungry and annoyed.","134":"Everybody has a favorite sushi place in Edmonton and Sushi Wasabi is one of mine. New sushi restaurants can pop up here and there but when it comes down to it, it's hard to beat favorites for a reason! Stellar food (in this case, fresh fish), good speedy service, family-owned, are just the few things I look for in restaurants. Sadly enough, those are the ones that I don't actually post a lot about. They're the restaurants that don't have a lot a hype and are easily missed on big lists, such as Avenue's Best Restaurants, or the like. So this will save me from answering the common question, \"What's your favorite sushi place in Edmonton?\" Sushi Wasabi for nigiri sushi and sashimi. Ichiban if I'm feeling like eating rolls... that post will come eventually.\n\nThere's been only one time Joe and I were seated at the bar. I wish I was brave enough to strike up a conversation with the seasoned staff behind the counter but I never did. Maybe one day if they're not busy... which is almost never. But one day!\n\nThe food is fantastic. Obviously. On our last visit, Joe had a chirashi bowl, which means \"scattered\" bowl. A rice bowl topped with whatever the chef has for the day, always including sashimi and fish roe. That day was a surf clam, octopus, tuna and salmon sashimi, ebi shrimp, tamago (egg), mushrooms and cucumbers! An awesome assortment for the seafood lover.\n\nMy lunch, although not as colorful and impressive as Joe's, was just as good though. I absolutely need salmon whenever I eat sushi, either in a hosomaki form like pictured, or in nigiri form. Last week I had a hankering for hosomaki and a couple pieces of hamachi (Japanese amberjack or yellowtail) nigiri. Mmm, both so buttery and creamy. I can eat this for days. If you're not a fan of wasabi, watch out for their nigiri pieces, there's wasabi in between the sashimi and rice. You're at Sushi Wasabi!\n\nAnd there you have it! My favorite sushi place for sushi and sashimi. It's a small space so make sure you reserve a table during peak hours and especially on Fridays and weekends. My coworker's favorite is their California Roll (are you thinking, whaaaat?) but theirs has grapefruit in it and the larger variety is the size of a hockey puck! I'm not the biggest fan of that particular roll but definitely something to try if you haven't yet. Parking is available in the lot. Go check it out!","135":"Best neighbors ever!!\n\nIf I would wish for a dream neighbor it would be Caviar & Bananas. \nYou know, that neighbor that is never in your business but always there when you need them! \nThe one that always have a cup of sugar and 2 eggs. Well, this place is it, they fulfill so many of my needs!\n\nNeed a healthy but still delicious lunch? Check!\nNeed a bottle of wine? Check!\nNeed a cold brew coffee with just a splash of almond milk? Check!\nNeed eggs? Check!\nNeed a gift basket? Check!\nNeed a frozen Rose? (Oh didn't know I needed that but I DO!) check! \nNeeeeeed that chocolate? Check!\nNeed a place for an informal meet up. Check! \nNeed a fast bar meal 8:00 pm? Check!\n\nI can go on and on.... but you get the point. These guys pretty much got it all. \n\nI'm so happy they are my neighbors and I hope they keep the good stuff up. Welcome to the neighborhood C&B and may you stay for a long time!!","136":"Uhhhmazing Italian! And  BYOB. Can't beat that! Went with a bunch of girlfriends for a 39th bday.  The \"look\" if restaurant is not impressive but don't let it fool you. Food is legit. Waitress was awesome too and very patient considering we are a loud group and might have gone through 10 bottles of wine? Off the beaten track in Conshy, but a good spot no doubt!","137":"Decided to try on a nice sunny day and sat outside.  Had the bama Salmon which was phenomenal and the mimosa was superb. The market has a lot of unique items which means you will be spending some money.  I'm glad I decided to stop in.","138":"Great sushi, bit if an odd environment that is a bit old and outdated and everyone is very close together. The food came fast but wasn't as good as I had been led to believe, especially for the price. The Sashimi was very fresh and a cool variety plate that our server, well the one who dropped it off, not sure we had a specific one, couldn't explain.","139":"I had heard about this place through Instagram and today I got to try it with some friends from my hometown. I love this concept- the interior is stunning and the food was just as good. The avocado toast was wonderful and adding the poached eggs made it even better. And to find a place that carries matcha is rare! I was so happy that this place offered it and I was told that there would be more matcha drinks to come. I can't wait to go back!!","140":"Mediocre food for caviar prices. Girlfriend and I split the avocado toast and the brunch burrito. Avocado toast tasted like pizza crust from the local late night broadway quick stop and the brunch burrito had limited flavor stuffed with gobs of sour creme. \n\nService was fine (hence why I'm giving it 2 stars). $32 for a coffee, (tasteless) brunch burrito and avocado toast is not.","141":"First off, this place is way better than the place before it. I can see myself coming here regularly in the future. Beer was surprisingly very good and reasonably priced. The ambiance is a little strange but in no offensive way. It's warm, they've got games and what not, but when I came (close to opening), the place was packed. \n\nService was a little disorganized but that's to be expected of a new restaurant. The seating is a bit of a mess on the long table which only compounds the service issue, but I'm not too concerned. Staff was friendly, and I could see no problems when we were actually ordering and what not.\n\nNow for the big thing: Food and drinks. The whole menu is very creative, and frankly I'm very thankful to have a bolder restaurant on State Street. Almost every restaurant on this street does the same old same old style of American. Even the nicer ones, while they taste great, are culinarily dull. The menu items and cocktails at Cruisery are just different enough to be refreshing. \n\nMy only problem was that when you finally tasted it, it either was a bit under seasoned, lacked depth, or just needed a little bit of a finishing touch conceptually. For example, I got the steak flatbread, and while the steak was great, bread was crisp, balsamic glaze great, but the amount of ingredients felt rather small, and combined with the lack of sufficient binding (like cheese), it just rolled around more or less. I felt like I was eating steak, and then bread, but never a steak flatbread. I also ordered a seared ahi tuna burger which came with pineapple in it. I loved the idea when reading all the ingredients, but when I tasted it I felt that the flavors dropped off quickly. \n\nI think the guys and girls running this place have a great head on their shoulders food and business wise, but it needs a little time to work out the kinks.","142":"Fish tastes great and fresh, sushi and rolls well done. Dine in or take out. The restaurant is clean and small, like sushi places all over, they take reservations and have nice pleasant staff. For the best Sushi in Edmonton, go here.","143":"First time here for lunch on a hot Friday afternoon.  Ample parking, clean restroom. Good service. I had the pasta special which had ground beef, mushrooms, marinara sauce and cream over penne served with garlic toast. Very yummy. My friend had penne with sausage,  eggplant and marinara plus hers came with a salad. Even the iced tea was good. Will definitely return. Thank you.","144":"Very cozy and super delicious Italian restaurant in Conshohocken! BYOB! We enjoyed the Veal Vivian and Pasta Cardinale for dinner. Both dishes were fantastic! Their olive oil was soooo good! I went home with 2 bottles (it was being sold for the holidays). The staff was friendly and attentive. I'm glad we made reservations for a Tuesday evening because it was crowded! It was a bit loud given the small size of the seating area and the number of people in the room. Can't wait to visit again!","145":"THIS. PLACE. IS. AMAZING. \nJust go. Family-run restaurant (), and the food is delicious. All of the dishes were well-portioned, and seasoned really well. Big flavors all around, and my whole family was super happy with every dish that came out. Dare I say better than the Italian BYO's that I've been to in Philly, which is saying something! Seriously, again, just go. You'll be happy.","146":"Been there now a couple of times and as much as I want to love this place, I can't give it more than three stars. I very much like the location and the service is so friendly. However, the most important thing in a restaurant is the food. This time we had mussels in sherry sauce, pasta with prawns and veal chop. There was way too much sherry on the mussels (should have used less sherry or should have cooked it for longer).  Pasta was too few for 30$ and was quite tasteless. Veal chop was grilled well. Came without the risotto that was promised. Instead they server something like a veggie lasagna. Was OK but nothing special. The veal came with a pepper sauce that tasted only like pepper and wasn't well balanced. Overall I have to say that there is better options in Conshohocken when it comes to value for money.","147":"Amazing! I lived in Japan for a number of years and this place is the closest you can get to authentic Japanese food in Edmonton. Anyone who thinks otherwise has probably never lived in Japan or wants Westernised Japanese food. It is pricey but worth it.","148":"I came to Trattoria Totaro with my wife for the first time for their Wild Game Night 2017. It was a prix fixe menu of game meat centered dished with beer pairings. The chef at this restaurant somehow knows exactly what my favorite flavors are. We had smoked trout over arugula with apples and walnuts, wild boar bolognese with homemade pappardelle (which was just perfect), duck, venison... and everything paired with a well thought out beer that balanced, accentuated, or counter pointed the flavors in the food. It was a spectacular meal and I am now a big fan of this Trattoria.","149":"I haven't found a time to go to Sushi Wasabi and was feeing odd that they only opens for a few hours each day for dinner. I didn't know that we needed to make reservations when I walked in on a Sunday night.\nThe waitress, which I assume was also the owner, met me in the front. She told me that I had an hour to eat  if I wanted to stay before the next reservation. She seemed uninterested in my desire to eat here....\nI consulted with my sister and we agreed that we will just try a few items on the menu to see how good there sushi is and if it's good, we'll come back next time.\nThis Japanese restaurant is small, tight and had some really cute d\u00e9cor around.\nWe were quickly seated by a new waitress. She didn't really know what to recommend us and didn't know how to engage in conversation with us.\nWe quickly decided on a few rolls: spicy tuna rolls, avocado & shitake rolls, spicy octopus rolls and salmon maki. \nThe fish tasted really fresh and really good.  The rice was a good texture and consistency. We were both impressed by how delicious the rolls were that it brought down the subtle annoyance of having only one hour to eat....\nWe took a huge chunk of Wasabi and was over the top surprised that it wasn't water down. We had a good spicy kick up our nose and was very happy that it happen. Boss man came around to fill up our water regularly. \nSushi Wasabi definitely peaked my interest and I will for sure come back here to try the other items on the menu.","150":"Loved this place upon arrival. The food I ordered was not warm and I was super disappointed in the staff who was not at all friendly. While I was waiting for my food a woman actually brought her food back up to the counter and asked the staff if they would mind warming it up because the center of her sandwich was cold. Maybe they're still trying to work it all out since they're still new but this was my first impression.","151":"The husband spotted this spot when I started to insist that he handle one meal a week all by himself. So this was his solution for about 3 weeks until I had enough of the pretty uninspired and re-heated bland Italian take out food that comprises this menu and insisted on taking over cooking. \n\nSeriously, the idea of Italian pasta take out is nice, but this just didn't work. Things were always prepared hot and fast, and that service was always so nice, but the food was just not good. The chicken is over pounded, wafer thin, and over baked\/fried. The pasta is pretty mushy. Reminded me of the Spaghetti Factory in Philly - and that's not my kind of food, either.","152":"While I don't live in the area anymore, I had heard about Trattoria Totaro a number of times but never stopped in. I was back home for the Thanksgiving holidays and we decided to get some take out on Sunday night. Over the years, we've tried all the local places and Totaro stands out as one of, if not the best, in the general area. \n\nSometimes take-out, especially from 'nicer' places doesn't necessarily travel well. That was not the case with Trattoria Totaro - this was some elevated Italian cuisine and it was delicious. The veal chop parmigiana must be one of the stars on the menu, judging from all the pictures - and two in our group decided to order that. Absolutely delicious, and huge. We had some of the Victoria pasta to share for the table as well, it was rich and clearly home made. While twice in a month may be a bit much - when the meal was finished we all agreed we should come back when I'm in town for Christmas.","153":"I was a regular on the first C&B run and was crushed when they closed.  I am so very happy they are back!  This was my first trip back and they did not disappoint.  Their asian tofu....delicious.  And when you add to to one of their incredibly fresh salads...one of my favorites anywhere.  My friend tried the sandwich of the day, smoked salmon, and loved it.\n\nPlease welcome them back with open arms...make multiple trips.  Nashville needs a spot like this and I'm so grateful they gave us another chance, let's not let them down!","154":"I wanted to be excited about this location of caviar and bananas, but I made the mistake of coming in 45 mins before closing. My order was forgotten then served cold. They did heat it up upon my request.  The dish was full of flavor and the presentation was nice.\nOne more note, there are no prices posted on beverages in the cooler or items in the freezer. I had to take several items to the register to ask what  price was of an item.","155":"Overall great ambience for a causal breakfast, brunch or lunch. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the music and the people. The food selection is nice with a good variety of healthy options. We had the sandwiches and they were made to order the way we like it! We also had their juice which we thought was a good combination of sweet and sour.  \n\nBottom line: I would come here again for a quick bite to eat or to meet a group for a causal lunch \n\nPros:\nGood healthy food choices \nFriendly people \n\nCons\nWeird payment system \nPatio has bugs so bring bug spray or stay covered","156":"My favorite restaurant in the Conshohocken area.  Food is fresh and tastes AMAZING.","157":"Great little BYOB in Conshy.  Italian food is very good and authentic.  Family run business.  The cannoli are homemade as well as one of the cakes.","158":"The food here is delicious but the service leaves a lot to be desired. It felt like a zoo!!! You walk in and there are no visible directions as to whether you can sit anywhere or wait to be seated. You finally walk through a maze of people eating and find a counter which appears to be a place to order food. There is no direction as to how to pay for the food. So it's entirely plausible to have your meal and walk away or take it to go without paying. I saw a couple asking the exact same question of where to pay for the food as we walked in. We were also confused as to whether we should take the dishes away or leave them at the table. A really beautiful space. The sandwiches were really really delicious. Our lunch order with 2 Cuban sandwiches, 2 sides and 1 soft drink came out to $40! The sides were expensive!!! A small side salad came out to almost $5. For me that's too much for lunch, it appears that the dinner prices are the same. The only person who smiled at us here was the guy at the counter.","159":"Came here early-ish in a Sunday morning with a large group. We all ordered from the coffee counter, took our number and waited at a table for the food. I ordered a iced latte or something similar which definitely took a long time to make. By the time it was done, my food was ready! \n\nI had the omelete with jalapeno grits and while I thought the omelete was good I found the grits so-so, I don't think I even finished them and I LOVE grits! \n\nThis place has a very quick grab and go vibe to it all while remaining sophisticated. You've got paper plates and utensils but stylish seating, decor, art, etc. \n\nI didn't explore the place but they did have an entire salad bar where they build the salad for you or you can customize. You can also shop around and buy food here, which I didn't do although my boyfriend's mom did buy us some caviar (which I haven't ate yet). They packaged it in a container of ice for us!","160":"This is a great little place to go get some quality sushi!\nThe venue is small and fairly active, so you may want to call in advance to book a seat as it often gets full.\n\nThe sushi is delicious, and you can tell they care about the quality of the fish they are serving you.  The food is always fresh and delivered within a reasonable amount of time. If you sit at the bar you can watch them make it right in front of you! \n\nThe price is decent and you get a good amount for what you pay for. They are never cheap with the size of their servings.  \n\nThe service is top notch. It is a family run restaurant, and these people care about their customers. \n\nOverall, if you love Sushi, this is the place to go in Edmonton.\n\nTheir lunch hours are variable and they are always closed on Mondays, generally I go there for dinner for a safe bet that they will be open.","161":"I chose Sushi Wasabi for my boyfriend's birthday after reading rave reviews. As an afterthought, I made a reservation... I'm glad I did.  This place is always pretty packed when I go here & it has a really tiny waiting area.  In fact, the entire restaurant is pretty small.  They have a great selection of fish with reasonable prices and everything is really fresh.  We always get the prerequisite tempura which is also very delicious.  My only complaint is the last time we were there, the tempura arrived last and took quite awhile to come.  They bring in specials regularly... last time we tried to the bluefin tuna & it was quite the treat  - a little heavy on the wasabi in the middle but some might like that. Would definitely recommend this place but would recommend making reservations, lest you get stuck waiting a long time.","162":"This is our absolute favorite restaurant. I lived in South Philly for 10 years and nothing ever came close to being as good. Service is always warm and welcoming. The food is consistently delicious. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.","163":"I absolutely love this little Italian restaurant!! Lived in Conshy all my life and this spot beats all the others!! As soon as you walk in the door you get that whiff of Italian food cooking, even if your not hungry you'll still want to eat!!! The owners, Vince and Donna do an excellent job along with their two daughters who frequently help out! Out of all the times i been there I have had not one bad entree. I'm a meat eater and let me tell you the grilled vegetable lasagna is excellent and i don't even miss not having meat!! Did i mention homemade pasta..YES homemade and its the real deal. Everything they do here they do with love down to the service, so come bring your bottle of old red wine and enjoy!","164":"Apps and beer, all delicious! Buffalo sauce is spot on! Beer variety makes it fun to come and test your palette.","165":"Sushi Wasabi is a little gem in a stripmall near Southgate Mall (behind the Petro-Canada). It's quite small and busy all the time - reservations definitely recommended. \n\nWe only sampled sashimi and maki. Their menu is very traditional, which is nice - don't expect any of those weird cream cheese rolls. The rice in the maki is perfect - lovely grains that are not mushy, and stick together nicely. My favourites are the spicy tuna, spicy octopus, tuna with green onion, and unagi. Simple, and showcases the quality of ingredients. Strangely, they don't have any spicy salmon or regular salmon rolls? However they do have salmon sashimi which is just phenomenal - they use high quality fish that is very fresh and actually tastes the way it should (in contrast to some places where the fish looks good but tastes like nothing). You can also order sashimi by the piece - basically anything they offer as nigiri, you can also get as sashimi. The one nigiri I did order was chop chop - I love the scallop - this one had roe mixed into the mayo which was neat. Unfortunately I found that there was too much mayo - too saucy for my liking.\n\nFor takeout, you have to order from their little paper menu (see Kris B.'s photos). I didn't compare it to their regular menu but I am pretty sure it is pared down. They have take-out specials that are mostly nigiri\/simple maki combos (substitutions accepted for a fee).\n\nIt's not cheap, but I'd definitely come back to try some other items like black cod (and eat more sashimi). I would be here all the time if it was closer to me!\nNote: don't expect great things for white wine - they only had two options but were out of the better one. Better to stick with beer :)","166":"Amazing. Some of the best Italian food I've had. I don't throw around a five-star rating like it's nothing. It's for how good the food is at such a good price. I often come here for lunch and I've yet to come across something I haven't liked. There's even things I've tried that I thought I didn't like that were delicious here. It's hard for me to get to trying everything I want to on the menu because I usually go with one of the specials. Yesterday I had the bbq pulled turkey with cole slaw on a kaiser roll. Not tradidtional Italian fare but it was awesome and only 6.95. I've only gone for dinner once and that was traditional pasta dishes. It was a big plus for me that it's BYOB, really helps save some money which isn't my specialty. Overall, no real complaints. The service is good, except for when it's really busy, but I can understand that. I'll definitely keep coming back, maybe I'll actually make it through the menu some day.","167":"Unusual evening. There was plenty op parking on a Friday night. Our group of for had reservations but we still had to wait 10 to 15 minutes. The restaurant is 2 small rooms and one was set for a very large group. It is  leisurely dinning to say the east. We were in no rush but we wanted to get our order in before the large group started ordering. Our foursome had a lot o talk about and 2 bottles of wine. Still the food took a long time to arrive.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The prices were in line with what one would expect. The menu is extensive. The portions were large. The sound level is high perhaps the large group added more to the noise than normal. The main negative was how our stomachs reacted to the food hours later. Both my wife and I were uncomfortable with the feeling. I took half of my order home and had it 2 days later. Again I reacted to the food. Maybe it is my age, who knows?  I'll try it agin someday but order more carefully.","168":"The service is very friendly here! Food is always fresh. The salads are amazing. It's a little on the pricey side, but you're paying for a great atmosphere and clean tables. I would definitely return","169":"Family owned place serving the community for over 50 years !!\n\nThe gnocchi and boar chop special was very good.","170":"LOVED  LOVED LOVED. Cheese steak, chicken biscuit, and even vegetarian options were great. Decor was adorable and staff was helpful. The layout was a little confusing for our first time but staff was more than happy to help us.","171":"Okay, here's the deal. I'm a huge insane yelp taker but not a giver. I only review when it's insanely bad or insanely good and this place is unreal. I feel like I'm in a dream. Amazing cocktails, incredible food, unbelievable venue. What more adjectives do you need? Get up and get here!","172":"I was with the group of 10 mentioned earlier.  I have never been treated the way we were treated by the chef\/owner.  We were celebrating a birthday and having a good time.  When he came out to our table and made the excuse that he \"forgot\" one of the dinners because \"he was rushing our order to get us out of the restaurant\" I was shocked.  We are reasonable people and if they wanted us to quiet down, why couldn't they have said something earlier instead of making excuses and being rude?  I don't get it. Totally unprofessional.  I guess they must do a good enough business that they can afford to act this way to 10 people--who will by word of mouth dissuade others from trying the restaurant.  That's a lot of business.","173":"I am absolutely BAFFLED that a place can be this amazing. The drinks are OUT OF THIS WORLD. \nThe food is worth the wait and the service is unreal. Dustin the bartender is just spectacular. \nNext time I'm in Santa Barbra this is where I will go.","174":"Despite what the name would suggest, Caviar & Bananas actually serves salads, sandwiches, and flatbreads, along with a stocked wine cupboard for sipping wine with some friends. Their salads and sandwiches are fresh and include some amazing ingredients like goat cheese and walnuts. All of their dressings are made in house and they offer good insight on which dressing to pair with the toppings in your salad. Overall the food is really fresh and delicious, but it is on the expensive side. Be prepared to spend 12-14 dollars on a salad or sandwich.","175":"Great salad bar selection! I love the fresh ingredients.... However, I can't help but describe it as a more upscale Panera. It's becoming one of my favorite places to grab a pricey latte!","176":"I have been lucky enough to have dined at restaurants all over the world, and there is no place like Totaro's. The enjoyment you get from the family atmosphere is only exceeded by the quality of the food. Veal, seafood or one of their signature wild game nights, you can't go wrong. The restaurant space makes you feel like you are in someone's house. Small intimate setting with Vince working his magic in the kitchen. Service had always been excellent, often provided by one of Vince and Donna's daughters. Go there once and this place will become your go-to.","177":"This place is a gem.  We had a group of 27 people after a Villanova Graduation that Victoria came to our rescue.  We had booked a group dinner 8 months earlier near Wayne and found out they had Closed down the week before graduation!  Knowing most places near Nova would be booked we started calling places in Conshocken.  Tough finding a place on short notice let alone one that could take 27 people!  Trattoria Toraro's Victoria came to our rescue. She was able to work an area for us, do a pre-fix menu and it be BYBO was perfect for large group.   The food was delicious and plentiful, the staff did a great job handling a big group and the homemade chocolate cake was one of the best ever had.   Hats off to Victoria who saved the day for 3 families that had all traveled for such a special day","178":"Best sushi in ALBERTA... ya, i said it. Between all the sushi joints in Calgary and Edmonton (not even going to entertain the fact that another small prairie town here is going to have comparable sushi) this has been my favorite. I have been here numerous times and the quality and service never falters. \n\nFirst of all, its a small family business. The people making your sushi are actually Japanese,which is always a good first sign. Secondly their menu stays pretty traditional. You will not find rolls doused in spicy mayo\/brown rice\/other western nonsense. Instead the focus is on the quality of the fish which is highlighted by a smudge of wasabi placed on by the chef and perfectly vinegared rice. Prices are extremely fair for the quality of product they are offering. Lastly, if you want to understand what i'm talking about I think the mackerel and toro salmon are unreal here. \n\nI will say the other cooked items on the menu are just about average so it might be better to just fill up on the sushi pieces here instead as that would be more than sufficient for a pleasing full meal.","179":"Whatsupb? No wait, that's wrong. Sushi Wasabi is a small but cozy Japanese restaurant located on the south side of town. The restaurant is hidden in a tiny strip mall area (look for the Shell gas station) but is definitely worth checking out. It reminded me of Vancouver as Sushi Wasabi has that cramped, intimate feel to it (to some extent). Does that mean you can skip the trip to Vancouver? Haha, let's not go overboard with those type of expectations youngin'.\n\nWe went on a Sunday for dinner and the place was pretty busy. We didn't have to wait (score!) but if you can't grab a seat, there's always the best spot in the house (sushi bar), which was empty when we arrived. Sushi Wasabi had a bunch of interesting daily specials so we decided to try out a few along with ordering a few others off their menu. The waitresses are all very friendly and the chef's are the same, greeting you when you enter and exit.\n\n- Green tea ($3.00 for two) - the tea was hot, delicious and unlimited. My tea drinking goes through the roof when I'm at restaurants, haha.\n- Goshumori (5 Item Plate) ($8.00) -an appetizer dish of eggplant saut\u00e9ed with chili miso, takowasa, vinegared lotus root, smoked monkfish liver and vermicelli salad. I enjoyed the eggplant and monkfish liver (very similar texture to a p\u00e2t\u00e9). The vinegared lotus root looked pretty but didn't have much taste to it. The tako was good but man, why are they so difficult to pick up? Haha. The vermicelli salad tasted like a poor man's coleslaw unfortunately.\n- #6 Sushi combination ($22.00) - beautifully plated, you get one piece each of tuna, salmon, shrimp, surf clam, octopus, yellowtail, imitation crab stick, tobiko and masago. Also included is one roll of kappa-maki (cucumber). All the nigiri was good and everything tasted fresh.  The slices were slightly on the smaller side but the quality is there.\n- Aburi salmon maki (seared) ($6.95), negitoro ($5.75) and spicy tuna ($5.75) - we tried the aburi salmon, which was one of their daily specials along with two uramaki rolls. The negitoro (tuna and green onions) and spicy tuna were a nice contrast to each other. Each order gets you 6 pieces. Everything was delicious but my fav was the aburi salmon. Searing the salmon gave it a nice charred flavour and the addition of red onions was something completely unexpected.\n\nMy first experience at Sushi Wasabi was a great one and I am happy to have found another good sushi spot in town. South side seems to be the spot to go to when you want Asian good eats. Wasabi out.","180":"Expecting much from this neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Alas, it didn't really deliver.  This is a homey Italian restaurant in the old school tradition with old tables and high school cafeteria like chairs.  A bit dated but it seems to work for the locals.  The menu is very large which puts me off straight away.  Can't do all those dishes with any great skill.  I had the veal which was chewy over home made pasta which was way way over done.  My dining partner had the vegetable lasagne which by the way had no pasta.  Much like a vegetable casserole.  Interesting but nothing special.  The service was awful and the servers chaotic and scatter-brained, and we waited an hour for the entrees.  Salad is extra which is unusual for the rather pricey menu.  We had to repeatedly ask for bread which which was insufficient for the number of guest at our table.  Pass on this one","181":"I love this restaurant.  I work in Conshohocken and my coworkers and I eat out often.  We eat at all the restaurants in the area, but typically when we do, we end up wishing we just went to Trattoria.  The food is always fantastic.  I know it is an Italian place, but they also make some of the best and most interesting sandwiches ever.  Try the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich.  It is one of the best things ever created.  For dinner Vince is always making something fantastic.  Osso Buco never fails to amaze me.  I also like his homemade pastas and ravioli... especially in Fall when he is making things with pumpkin and squash.  They also make their own garlic olive oil.  I don't know if they sell it, but they should.  It is absurdly good.  Try this place if you are in the area.","182":"I came here for an early brunch with friends and ordered the Frose with a BYO Brunch Plate. My plate consisted of applewood bacon, scrambled eggs, a biscuit and jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits. A\n\nFirst the frose was very bitter. The champagne used in this is a cheaper brut which needed to be balanced with more sugary elements. Of the 8 girls that came with me no one liked their frose. I sent mine back for champagne. If you want a frose go to sambuca. \n\nMy BYO plate is was under seasoned and poorly cooked. My eggs had no salt or pepper on them and were watery. My bacon sat in it's on grease which is not appetizing. When you cook bacon put it on something to let the grease drip off. My biscuit was the worst of all. It was hard as a rock and most of it was inedible. I tried to eat it because the  raspberry jam looked homemade and I wanted it so bad. I could not bite into the biscuit so I ate the inside layer and left all edges and crust. This was a very disappointing brunch experience.\n\nSide note: everything here is plastic or paper. Every plate and every piece of silverware. I can't even imagine how much landfill waste this place makes daily. Panera bread has plates and silverware so this place certainly can too","183":"I ordered the Zucchini Toastie and the best way to describe it is pathetic. The sandwich was $8.75 but probably valued at $2. Barely anything on the sandwich. I expected more from such a gourmet marketed place. It is very cute but not worth the money.","184":"Amazing food. So fresh, so comforting! The family atmosphere (family owned) makes you feel like you are over a friend's house enjoying a perfect meal. The eggplant rollitini and grilled vegetables lasagna are things I now dream about! I'm hesitant to write this review because it will become too popular!","185":"The food was amazing and the atmosphere was inviting. The restaurant is large and very baby and kid friendly, which was very important to me. I had the chicken biscuit and it was delicious!","186":"Excellent authentic Italian food. House-made pasta, flavorful authentic dishes... Fantastic! The desserts are worth saving room for (if you can)! The ambiance is so-so--the restaurant is small and somewhat cramped, but clean, functional, and adequately lit. It may take a while to get your food if it's busy, but they will keep you happy with freshly baked bread and house-made olive oil. Reservations are required to get into this gem. I highly recommend this restaurant. Do not be fooled by the exterior, which is not an eyesore by any means, but nothing special or froufrou. Follow your nose; the moment you step into the restaurant you'll be glad you came. It's BYOB, but they do not charge a corking fee. The restaurant is a tad expensive, but not inappropriately so for the quality of the food you get (and the quantity). Again, I highly recommend this restaurant. They can seat groups, but it will be a bit cramped. It can get noisy on a Friday night, but not out of control. It is not as though they have loud music or anything. The sounds are just those of happy people enjoying good food. No TVs. No DJ. Again, just excellent food (even better with excellent company).","187":"This is a solid  neighborhood establishment serving good quality Japanese food covering all the usual suspects: sushi, tempura, teishoku and the like. \n\nMy family and I have been going to Wasabi for over a decade, from its earlier incarnation as a simple takeout sushi stand in a small shopping centre in Old Strathcona. Over the years, the quality of the food, the generous portions of nigiri and the homely service from the Japanese couple who own the place have not diminished. Deservedly so, this restaurant is consistently busy on Friday and Saturday evenings. \n\nTo be sure, you're not going to get cutting edge fusion Japanese, or haute cuisine from an Iron Chef, but Wasabi is consistent, friendly and has earned my loyalty for years of great sushi and friendly service. In my mind, this makes it stand out from the raft of new Japanese places that have popped up over the past decade in Edmonton. Try the beef tataki too... my favorite item on the menu!\n\nTake out available...","188":"Fantastic sushi. I have been to this restaurant DOZENS of times. The sushi is delicious and always fresh. California rolls are enormous and best in the city. Small and family run, if you want to get a table on a Friday or Saturday you better make a reservation! The odd time we have gone during peak hours and waited a long time for food but it happens from time to time. Some waitresses are not overly pleasant, but the food quality makes up for it. Chefs always great you when you come in the door. Will keep returning!","189":"Caviar and Bananas is very middle of the road with high prices. The food is decent and is good if you're on the run, but there's a lot of unnecessary hype over this place. The interior is very beautiful, but obviously that's not what makes a restaurant good if the food isn't good. If it's busy I wouldn't recommend stopping here. The sandwiches are okay and the salads are pretty great (but $15 ouch!). I've also had a caf\u00e9 au lait here that was very sub par in the world of my caf\u00e9 au lait connoiseurship.","190":"I sometimes go to this place for lunch. I love their fish tacos. They are usually a Friday special only though. I haven't been as thrilled about their other dishes but the 4 stars are for their sangria and fish tacos. The place is small but cozy. They also have a little bit of outdoor seating when the weather is nice.","191":"Amazing food. Great cocktails. Execeptional service and a relaxed atmosphere. Very affordable. Cannot fault this gem of a place!","192":"The best sushi place I've found in Edmonton so far. I have been three times and never had anything I wouldn't call delicious. The maki, nigiri, and sashimi are all excellent. And the place has the exact vibe you want from a sushi joint. Small, friendly, and a sushi chef that looks like he's been doing it right for decades.\n\nThe prices are a little high, although not out of line for what sushi goes for in Edmonton. And while I like the small restaurant vibe, it can make getting in for dinner a challenge. But in terms of quality and taste, this place can't be matched in Edmonton.","193":"Our group of 10 dined at this neighborhood BYOB last night and had wonderful time. We all worked together years ago and had a lot of catching up to do. The food was wonderful, the portions were huge and the staff was attentive and accommodating. Vince, the owner stopped by the table several times to check on us but we were never rushed or made to feel anything but welcome. In this age of chain restaurants and pretentious eateries, Totaro's is a throwback, an old fashioned neighborhood place whose owner and staff take pride in their restaurant, their food, and their guest's comfort. I will be recommending this place often.","194":"Worst experience I ever had. We ordered food to be delivered to our house. There was a DEAD FLY baked in to the food, and then covered in cheese. When we called to complain, no one could understand english. The owner finally got on the phone, and when he realized why I was calling his response was \"sometimes things happen\". When I asked when the last time a health inspector was in their kitchen, he could not provide an answer. NEVER EAT HERE.","195":"At first I thought this place was only drinks, but tonight I found out they have some bomb ass food too! The burger and fries made me open yelp mid way through so I didn't forget to let people know.","196":"The food was delicious and clearly homemade: pasta al dente and the sauces flavorful and varied. Our family of five foodies was impressed by the down to earth atmosphere and tasty dishes. The warm bread with flavorful dipping oil took the edge off our hunger. Then we shared the pear and Caesar salads. We had four different mains and a myriad of desserts. That lava cake and the cannolis were amazing finishes to the meal! We'll be back for sure.","197":"Ok so this place is a pass. Mainly because the food is pretty horrible. Surprisingly bad. I'll start by saying it's a super cute place, it has the atmosphere, a pretty good ordering system and great drinks. We didn't have trouble ordering or finding a table even though it was super busy. We ordered coffee and OJ both were good and I ate a chocolate croissant that was amazing! \n\nHowever, two of us ordered omelettes, they are $10 and come with one small side. I got mine egg whites with the spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese, I couldn't believe when they brought it out firstly it was tiny secondly it didn't look good it looked like one of those rubbery omelette made in the rubber mold in the microwave. I got potatoes as a side they were awful, super dry and drowned in Parmesan cheese and a cheap cheese. The plating was horrendous too for such a cheap place they stick your omelette on a paper plate with nothing else (it looked sad) and gave you your potatoes in another paper container. Why are they using paper and not real China? It's bad for the environment and made my $10 meal look like a $4 mall food court item. My friend ordered the omelette with whole eggs and grits as the side. Hers looked exactly like mine like it came from an \"As seen on TV\" rubber mold and she had grits on the side. Also she said it was bad. Our other friend ordered the quinoa bowl and mid way through stopped eating it and asked her why, she said they haven't cooked one or two of the vegetables they are still raw and it's not good. \n\nThe service is lackluster, I ordered a side biscuit (which by the way was not good) they don't bring it with butter or jam you have to request it and they send you to wait in the line at the bar for it again. They also aren't friendly the people bringing you the food not the ones at the bar those are super nice. Their water was out so we had to wait for them to refill and that took forever. \n\nWould recommend going to see the place, order a coffee and pastry, sit and enjoy the space but don't go for a meal.","198":"Great atmosphere! Flatbreads and buffalo wings were amazing! Staff were friendly and welcoming! Given the short time they've been open, it's definitely on its way to becoming a well oiled machine!","199":"Decided to go out during this string of snow and ice storms. The establishment was probably a corner grocery store - reminded me of my grandmother's little corner store from years ago. Cozy place - friendly upon entrance. Several tables in the \"front\" room - them more in the side room. Not fancy by any means - open kitchen. We were seated in the side room. Tables are nicely spaced and noise level was fine. Menu was complete and interesting. I had very good calamari for an app. Main course was a tasty lasagna with risotto. Portions were ample. Service was very friendly - Vince the owner\/chef came around the room twice to greet the diners. He chatted with us about the dishes and asked how the food was. We were a party of 4 and everyone loved it. We didn't have desert or coffee so no comment here. We will be back. This is BYO and the glasses and wine service was fine. This would be a great place for a wine dinner.","200":"This was just a strange experience. Walking in you feel the identity crisis. The prices are outrageous even by Nashville standards. The quality is exactly what you would expect from a place trying to do too much. My sandwich was warm around the edges and refrigerator cold in the middle. Cool concept. Cool name. Cool area. Poorly executed.","201":"Well it's turned into one of those CLOSE TO CAMPUS places. The person taking the orders was not very smooth. But the DEAL BREAKER was the food POISONING. That's Right food poisoning. I spent the rest of the day between the couch and a little boy's room. Won't be back to this place. I might add it either came from the eggs not being cooked or the additives. If you're under 30 you might like this place if you're over 30 save yourself an illness. YMMV.","202":"Stopped for lunch today and really enjoyed it.  Friendly service and the food was very good and reasonable price.  Plenty of parking on the street.  Indoor and Outdoor seating.  They also take reservations.  Nice list of specials.","203":"Okay, here's the deal. I'm a huge insane yelp taker but not a giver. I only review when it's insanely bad or insanely good and this place is unreal. I feel like I'm in a dream. Amazing cocktails, incredible food, unbelievable venue. What more adjectives do you need? Get up and get here","204":"Homey, comfortable, and DELICIOUS. Be sure to call for a reservation!\n\nWe had an amazing birthday dinner here a few weeks ago- they were so gracious and understanding as I knew I would have a party of about 10-12. The food here is delicious, and you can taste the tradition and care in each dish. Oh and BYOB! We brought a cooler and wine, wait staff was amazing in helping the drinks to keep flowing. I've been many times before, and will certainly be back. I'm still thinking about that chicken parm... and the home made desserts! YUM","205":"First time here! And this place I feel like I was in a different whole new state! My friends and I just came here for drinks and we got the frose' . Very cute place , and definitely will be coming back to try out more stuff!","206":"Great family owned neighborhood gem. Never disappointed . Been here on numerous occasions either with a party of 4-6 or a family party of 10 or more and have always left feeling completely satisfied with the service and of course the quality and presentation of dishes. No need to go into the big city. This small byob has the old world Italy, village type feel with the authentic dishes you would expect. Bring a few bottles and enjoy. Keep up the great work, Vince and Donna.\n\n\nNick d.","207":"Sushi Wasabi is tied for best sushi in Edmonton in my books.  I went there tonight with my family for dinner and had a fantastic experience.  The restaurant is small, so make sure you call ahead to book a table. (we called 45 minutes before getting there and they held us a table)\n\nThe highlights of our meal were the tempura, it was light and fluffy but still crisp and not greasy which was awesome.  The avocado salmon roll was amazing.  My personal favorite is the Dynamite Roll no matter where we go, but at Wasabi sushi it perfectly pairs their amazing tempura with my favorite roll.\n\nI am also a wasabi guy, so let me tell you that their Wasabi is amazingly flavourful without being unnecessarily spicy. \n\nIf you get the chance to go to Wasabi for sushi I highly recommend it, I drove nearly 100 blocks to get there, right past a couple of other sushi restaurants and think you should do the same.","208":"Had an excellent meal here with two good friends. The food was exquisite. While the server was sweet, she was overwhelmed and understaffed for the number of people. During the evening, she had 22 tops. All in all that doesn't sound terrible, however there was little separation in timing for her.","209":"Nice hidden gem in Conshohocken.  Authentic Italian menu with a very homespun feel.  BYOB is a plus.  You feel like family here and worth a visit with a few good friends and a couple bottles of red as well.","210":"I visited Caviar and Bananas on a Monday at 9:45am. \nFirst the positive:  the interior is bright and fun.  The space is large and can easily accommodate groups meeting for lunch.  The lunch counter is open at 9:45 am. \n The staff was nice. \nThe negative:\nThe line at the coffee bar\/breakfast line had about 7 people in it and others were standing waiting for their food to be ready.  I wanted to try the ricotta toast but I did not want to wait 30 minutes for toast. So I ordered lunch. \nMy roasted chicken wrap had plenty of chicken which was nice. There was also plenty of arugula. But that was about it.  There should have been tomatoes, red onion, cheese and a spread. One bite had a taste of a dressing\/spread.  Also, there was at least 1\/3 of the tortilla left once I ate the filling. No chips or side item or drink. The wrap cost $9.50. I believe the menu is overpriced for what I received.","211":"Great food and friendly service. The place is small, but cozy. The only issue is the fact that the place is a bit noisy, so you have to yell to get heard at your table.","212":"How fun and mod is this place? Something for everyone. It is modern sleek and something like a very upscale choose your own food. You may choose from breakfast items, amazing salads or sandwiches. Each in a different area. You take your pick and pay at a central area. If you want to be waited on ... not for you. If you want very healthy interesting food .. perfect. The sweet chili Brussel sprouts are to die for. Cuban sandwich nice too. I liked it.","213":"My best friend lives in the apartment above this place and we went on a double date here recently. To my surprise, it was outstanding food.\n\nThe service was a little slow, but if you're with good company that shouldn't matter much.\n\nThe space was very loud as two birthday parties were in what is a very small dinning room area, but once again if you're with a good crowd you'll be just as loud.\n\nI got the osso bucco with wild mushroom risotto and it was out of this world. Soooo good.\n\nI recommend this for anyone in the Conshohocken area. Don't forget to bring a nice bottle with you when you go.","214":"If you're looking for a place with great drinks, good food and great service, this is the place. The menu has just the right amount of drink and food options where you don't feel overwhelmed. The ketchup..WOW so good. Even when it falls in your sock. Great people, great vibes. This place can do no wrong.","215":"Was so excited for this place... but I believe the leadership & execution here, particularly in the Kitchen, needs some serious revamping.\n\nI've eaten at Caviar & Bananas in Charleston, and we had the most amazing sandwich! Their ingredients were fresh, the menu well thought out and even better prepared, and staff was sharp and knowledgable.\n\nAt this new Nashville location though, I was missing those things.\n\nThe location, layout, decor and ambiance of the restaurant gets an A+, it's one of the nicest in Nashville. But the food, was sadly very disappointing. \n\nThe sandwich we got had Arugula, Egg, Turkey and some other stuff, and it looked amazing... but it had weak and cheap tasting bread, and cheap tasting Turkey. I'm not sure what they use, but it was very disappointing and reminded me of cheap packaged deli meat... especially for the price this was a shock. We also got avocado toast which reads great on the menu, but again thin \/ cheap bread and an old (dark green) avocado spread that didn't taste fresh at all. We love Avo toast! So this was a bummer.\n\nWe also got a Quinoa Kale Veggie Breakfast bowl, but the overall taste of the quinoa and veggies was slightly undercooked and the ingredients weren't prepared to compliment each other. The eggs on top were fine... The staff was very sweet, but wasn't sure what one of the items in the dish even was... they did refund the dish after I talked with them about not enjoying it all, which was awesome. Then i ordered the recommended Chicken Biscuit instead, and it was unfortunately worse. The cheese tasted cheap, the scrambled eggs were soggy, and the chicken was thin and soggy itself, which was crazy. I was actually so surprised because Nashville is a great Fried Chicken town and this was the worst piece of Chicken I've had here... A $3 Chicken biscuit from Chic-Fil-A or Zaxbys would have been much much better taste and better quality chicken (I know, strange)... and this cost $10. Also, I ordered it with Parmesan Potatoes which might have been okay but sadly they came out cold and not fresh... like they had been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes... \n\nWe did order a croissant with strawberry jam and it was amazing! So props there... \n\nFor what this place could be, it has a lot of improvement to make. They have a great foundation, beautiful space, sweet people, and awesome croissants... they just really need to up the game on the quality of the food! And please do! I would love to come back and enjoy C&B at its fullest potential.","216":"It is the best sushi restaurant in the city and the quality has always been high. I just wish we lived closer to an ocean so the couple who own the restaurant had access to fresher food!","217":"This little Italian place is the first in a long time that reminds me of what good Italian food should be.  Every time I go, we leave completely satisfied.  Other reviewers have commented about slow service, but if you want quality, you should be comfortable at Trattoria's pace.  This is not Olive garden.  The portion sizes versus prices are very fair and honestly, there's usually enough leftovers for a snack later.","218":"I wish I could give minus 5 stars for this place. I must admit it did look fishy on the outside but the reviews were good so I convinced my gf to give it a try. It started with the water that tasted like something out of a sewer. When we mentioned it our only  option was to pay for bottled water or pellegrino, waitress never offered to taste the water after our complaint. Then my gf wanted salad with some grilled chicken which at the end once they saw our dining out card they decided to add on $5 extra, for the total cost of $21???!!!? Her greens as well as mine were so bitter we could only eat half of it. My main dish veal shank was ok not much tenderness or flavor. I can probably make it better at home. As for service it was terrible with so much attitude that we just paid our bill and ran out to never return. Please be aware. I've dined at some shady and very expensive places all over the world and this was by far the biggest gotcha I ever got in my own backyard.","219":"This is a very interesting spot for specialty items and local items like that delicious Nashville fountain of juice. This is a great place to grab coffee, dessert or a salad \/ sandwich for lunch.","220":"Unfortunately this isn't really a craft beer brewery but more of a reboot of BrewCo with very similiar layout, full wait service, etc.  The few beers I tried we're not that great compared to today's high quality craft beer standards.  The advertising and remodel seemed focused on a hipster brewpub, but really this is just  BrewCo more modernized.","221":"Eh; there are three counters to order from all with different menus. The presentation when the food was served was less than stellar on paper plates and my chicken breakfast biscuit was a large portion compared to my friends but was really salty. No refills on coffee","222":"Just moved to the area a few a months ago, and have been trying to find our new go to pizza spot after moving from the city. This is now that place. Not only does it remind of my favorite spot from where I grew up, but the food is fantastic, and some of the best pizza I've ever had. We bought a few pies for a party recently and the guests were also raving about it (especially the cheesteak pizza and grandma's pizza). We will be regulars from now on.","223":"All you need to know is the Tennessee Trio. It rocked my world! I'm a huge sandwich person - perfect vessel in my opinion. The Tennessee Trio has ham, fried pork belly and bacon jam. I went to two of their soft openings and got the same thing... it was that good.\n\nInterior is gorgeous. Very clean and modern. It'll be great for a lot of Nashville and tourist Instagrammers to get their pose on. \n\nAs far as groceries, lots of curated items from both Nashville and beyond. They have McClures pickles... being from Michigan I got super pumped about those. They also carry Jenis Ice Cream pints which are down right dangerous. Great selection of coffee, sweets, cheeses, charcuterie and wine.\n\nThe only reason it's not a full 5 is the parking situation. All the lots in midtown are super expensive or you need change for meters (it's 2017 I don't carry anything that's monetary unless it's a card). If you do meters, it's $1.50 per hour in that area.  Paid lots are about $8 an hour.","224":"Went here with a party of 7 on a Monday night and the food was really good. We were sat at 6:45pm (with reservations) and didn't leave until close to 10pm. It wasn't that the service was bad, it just appeared there were 3 people working - The waitress, the cook, and a bus boy. The waitress was really friendly and cheerful whenever we saw her. We got 3 appetizers and almost everyone got a \"special\". With that said the bill came to $300 without tip, and thats with it being a BYOB. So even though it was a little pricey and definitely a longer than normal dinner, we enjoyed ourselves and we will definitely be back.","225":"Fun place. A little confusing but at first but once you get the hang of it, delicious!","226":"I have to be honest that I don't like much Japanese restaurants in Edmonton.  But Wasabi's food is excellent. I was craving their blue fin tuna and their chop chop and it satisfied my craving x10!! Definitely a go-to place!","227":"The best sushi you can get in Edmonton. Pricey but worth it. Very authentic and uses real wasabi (not the powder stuff).","228":"Good food and people. Kevin was awesome, he took the time to talk to us and didn't seem rushed. Great dude and good place! Awesome!","229":"It's a Tuesday night and we wanted something easy but delicious. The Cruisery did not disappoint! Expect your regular bar style food like burgers and wings but with some special twists. \n\nKeep it mind it's a Tuesday so the bar is relatively quiet and service was excellent. Maybe it's different on busier nights but we were served beautifully. Staff is super friendly and accommodating, our waiter even introduced himself to our dog!\n\nDid I mention it's dog friendly? We need more places like this in Santa Barbara! \n\nDo yourself a favor and come here, and get yourself some of the delicious house pretzels!","230":"The best restaurant in Conshohocken! The entrees are delicious and its BYOB. How much better can it get?","231":"The food here was incredible. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito, empanadas, and skillet nachos. Excellent happy hour. Awesome ambiance. What a fine establishment.","232":"I could never recommend this place I went in on a busy Friday night I ordered a personal small pizza to go. After waiting half an hour and asking them about it twice it turned out they never put the order in. So they handed us a large pie that was already done. Fine. We took it home to discover an oily greasy gloppy pizza. It was awful. Won't be going back","233":"Soo incredibly slow. Their kitchen is a mess- the staff doesn't know what they are doing.\n\nWe ordered a sunrise sandwich and here is what happened:\n\n1. They ran out of the key ingredient: turkey sausage\n2. We waited 20 minutes for the sand which\n3. The sandwich came without the 2nd key ingredient: pesto\n4. When we asked them about it, they made us open up the sandwich to show them that it was missing pesto\n5. They gave us the pesto in a Dixie cup \n6. They are not apologetic at all about any of it\n\nAt least the sandwich is decent. That's why I gave it 1 star!! :)","234":"I just wanted to review my reservation from Friday 9\/27.. I had a reservation for 8pm. Upon entering I was ignored by staff for a 8 party table. I stood for approx. 10 mins until finally being acknowledged by staff. Staff repeatedly walked by avoiding eye contact and conversation. My party sat at 8:10pm. At approx 8:20pm my party asked for their wine to be opened and your staff stated \"I'm not assigned to you\" and walked away. At 8:30 we still hadn't been greeted nor had our wine opened so at 8:31pm we chose to leave. This was actually the second time my party decided to give your restaurant a chance and unfortunately the service was even worst that the first time.. I really hope you can learn from this and treat customers the way they are supposed to be treated.","235":"Wanted to love this place because I love to look and set up. I found that the people working there were not really interested in the guest. Had to ask to be checked out when no one was in line. The gentleman that showed us around was very nice,but the rest of the staff wasn't what I would consider friendly, especially for being new. \n\nThe food was ok, but think I may have just ordered the wrong thing. The food did take a while for a place that is supposed to be quick. Will give another try since they are new but overall just think it's ok.","236":"I like the Cruisery! \n\nDelicious, creative drinks and a fun atmosphere, for sure. The drink I ordered, Flaming Lips, was so freaking good, I'll be craving it for the rest of my life probably. \n\nI had the smash burger, and it was basic but everything a decent burger should be. It was messy, juicy, and pretty big and packed with the traditional burger toppings. Plus I loved how it was on a potato bun. Very good choice.  \n\nThe only thing that was NOT up to par was that their wings were way too fatty and chewy. They give you about 7-8, and we didn't even finish them.Yeah they're big, but not worth it when they barely have any meat on them. Maybe crisp them up just a little bit more?\n\nAnyway, we'll still be back for the drinks, the burger, happy hour, and the tacos which I haven't tried yet but are definitely on my list.","237":"Meh, go to the other pizza places around, or you can order a better pizza at the food store right next to it.  Tried this place a few times, and am now over this place. I even walked for a pizza\/wing combo pick up once (and never again) While i was waiting well past the time i was told my order would be ready, saw the owner taking cash from a customer, and then continued to make food while intently watching soccer. Took a little more than an hour since making the original call to the time I arrived back home.  Ive ordered delivery, the driver (Mike?) is Great!  But last 2 times my order was 25\/30 minuets late, i know it wasn't the driver though. Last time i ordered they 2x charged me. So be aware of that also","238":"Came here for lunch today. Clean place. Basic pizza joint. Not a lot of pizza selections - basics and some speciality pies. I got a turkey hoagie after tax came to $7.30 - which I think is expensive for a hoagie. Good though. Thick sliced oven roasted turkey. nice fresh roll. Fast service.","239":"2nd update: \n\nI just got a call from the General Manager, who was out the week we came in, apologizing specifically and extensively for the credit card processing issues and the lack of follow-up, and acknowledging that they appreciate and take into account constructive feedback from guests. \n\nHe gave examples of how he is training his staff so that something like this doesn't happen again, and acknowledged that it is his responsibility as a manager to make sure that they are appropriately trained in the future. \n\nHe then immediately went into the system and refunded the errant charge as well as the amount of my correct check, emailed me confirmations for both, and addressed each of my concerns in turn (including the beer complaints, which he acknowledged that he has been hearing from a few people). \n\nLastly, he invited us back in for a cocktail sometime soon, and explained that he hand-crafted the cocktail menu himself. \n\nAll-in-all, a customer service done to perfection. Thanks for making it right!","240":"This is the best Japanese restaurant in Edmonton. Though they have a rather limited menu, the quality of their food is amazing. There is a distinct difference for their sashimi\/sushi compared to other restaurants (freshness?cut?). Some of the items that are definitely worth getting are: beef tataki, assorted sashimi, chop chop cone, negitoro cone, and their special rolls.","241":"My prior review was not so favorable and I'd like to \"undo\" that!!\n\nUnbeknownst to me, I haven't been getting voicemails in a month. Today, I got the voicemail from Totaro's advising me of the family emergency! I am so sorry to have left a negative review for one of the most, if not THE best Italian restaurants in Conshohocken (and beyond!!)\n\nEverything on the menu is delicious, and you MUST get their chocolate or vanilla cake (or BOTH) for dessert! My favorite entree is the vegetable lasagna. It is to die for!!!","242":"Sucks. Sad hospital food on paper plates.\n\nWent on a Sunday at noon. Music was so loud we couldn't hear the cashier. We ordered two coffees, both with room. Both were filled to the lid. When my wife asked again for room in hers, the baristas laughed at her and told her to \"chug it.\"\n\n$10 meals arrived on small paper plates. Poached eggs were hard, solid blobs atop cold sweet potatoes coated in cinnamon. \"DYO plate\" was overcooked scrambled eggs alongside a hard, dry biscuit and tough bacon.\n\nPlace looks cool inside. Could get a better meal literally anywhere else.","243":"Great spot to either stop in and grab a cup of delicious coffee or sit down and get a bite to eat!  The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  They have an awesome patio to sit down and relax on a sunny day.  Anytime I need to spend some time getting work done on my laptop, Caviar and Bananas is my go to.  Their menu is diverse and has great options for whatever mood you are in.","244":"8:00 reservation on a Saturday night. We read the reviews before selecting this spot so we were prepared to wait. 90 minutes after we arrived our appetizer was delivered. 20 minutes later the Waitress came over and told us our food would be right out.  We were rationing Our wine (this is a 2 bottle experience) and our patience had run out. The food was mediocre and certainly not worth the long wait.  One more thing, the table was rocking like a see-saw.  Disappointing experience overall. We will not be back.","245":"I ordered an iced caramel latte, waited for about 15 minutes and was given mostly iced milk. Took one sip and threw the drink away.","246":"Sushi Wasabi is family owned and the place to find the freshest sushi and sashimi here in Edmonton. It is also one of the priciest but that's what you get for good quality. The location is small so be sure to call ahead of time to book a reservation if necessary. It also  looks a little old and run down from the outside. \n\nOn my most recent trip, we ordered the assorted sashimi dish, beef tataki, chop chop sushi, spicy tuna rolls, the salmon don and chicken karaage (not pictured). All the sashimi tasted rich and fresh. Beef tataki was delicious, gave you a decent amount of slices and wasn't overly salty. Overall a very tasty authentic Japanese meal. The bill came out to be around $100 that was split between two people. \n\nDon't expect to come here for a large variety of rolls or western fusion items here. This place is better for simple nigiri, maki rolls and sashimi.. but they are delicious!","247":"My husband and I tried this place on Friday. The food is tasty, but the service was slow. The portobello tacos were tasty but extra small. My husband's steak frites was good.Our biggest gripe was that they completely ignore the customers who stepped out side to smoke and vape right next to the door with all the foul and funky smells blowing in the front door. It was gross and we left as quickly as possible.","248":"Amazing and delicious salads , flatbreads, and sandwiches.  The coffee is really great as well.  Open all day and a perfect place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  They offer a catering program as well with great options.  Fun staff and a fun environment! 5 star.","249":"Finally, a great Indian restaurant in Rittenhouse. They just opened up and we ordered Chat Papri-excellant. Great onion nan. Loved the Baingan Bharta. The palak paneer was ordered medium spicy and came mild and that is my only complaint. We really loved the food and will most definitely order from them again.","250":"We found this place from a google search , seeking a new place to eat in Conshy , as we visit every two weeks or so for business, and finding a good \"lunch\" place is difficult . Kudos to the staff,,nothing was a problem , service was sincere and top notch . My chicken saltimbocca melted,,,literally melted,, like butter in my mouth ,,, the salad was tasty , my partner's soup was heavenly and his entree was extremely large ( enough for dinner later ) and fresh and very tasty . We have made a note in our book, we are definitely coming back .  I did not use the bathroom but he said it was very chic and clean and neat.  We sat outside on this perfect day ,,, it was an awesome lunch .  Not pricey at all --a good value for the lunch served. The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday ,,,, it's in the middle of no where,, but worth a trip. Will definitely be back .","251":"Yummy drink , yummy food!!  We Loved the ambiance . Everyone should go there for late night appetizers and drinks. We won't be disappointed","252":"This is a great place for sushi. It's rather small so I'd recommend reserving if you can. We order the sushi combination for $50 and the green bean tempura. This was a lot of food so I'd recommend just getting the combination plate. All the sushi was good except the octopus. I won't be ordering that again!","253":"This place used to be one of our go-to's. It recently closed and reopened, and we were excited to go back and try one of our favorite lunch spots.\n\nWhatever new ownership there is has absolutely ruined the menu. I ordered what turned out to be the worst salad I've ever had here; the lettuce was flavorless and wet, the chicken was absolutely disgusting, and they were out of multiple of the ingredients but charged me the full value of the salad before telling me. Used to be one of my most recommended spots in Nashville, now I'm just waiting for it to close again.","254":"LOVED  LOVED LOVED. Cheese steak, chicken biscuit, and even vegetarian options were great. Decor was adorable and staff was helpful. The layout was a little confusing for our first time but staff was more than happy to help us.","255":"High recommend going!!! Caviar and bananas was delicious. Not only was the food wonderful, the coffee was also amazing. The atmosphere is warm and exciting from the moment you walk in the door. I would highly recommend trying the Waldorf salad, the Cobb, or the hot chicken salad!! If you're looking for something different, try the the roasted zucchini or roasted pear flatbread. They were both amazing. The fire kombucha is also unique and definitely my favorite! For a sweet craving, try the butterscotch blondie, the black and white brownie, or the coffee cake.","256":"Went here with my wife for a one day after anniversary dinner. It was a Monday night and the Eagles were playing so at 730 it was pretty empty.  Nevertheless we really liked it. Old time Italian atmosphere. The service was very good as was the food. We had lobster ravioli which was solid. Would have liked to have seen more lobster in it but the sauce and the pasta were both great.  My entree was the veal saltimbocca over pasta and it was delicious. My wife had a pork loin special over apple risotto and really enjoyed it. We had a caramel cheesecake that was also good. I think it was slightly overpriced but overall this place is a good night out and we will definitely go back.","257":"The staff and Drinks were amazing! Shout out to Manager Katie for helping us plan our Santa Barbara day trip!","258":"I've been here a time or two before and did not think much of it. It's pricey and a bit too \"frou frou\" for my taste. I really just thought this place was another West End over-the-top restaurant. While in the area again, I figured I'd give it another shot, because everything deserves a second chance.\n\nI've only dined in for breakfast, but have heard people rave about the lunch and dinner menus. They had salads, sandwiches, wraps, and other great options. They had a plethora of unique side options that looked so dang good--from chicken salad and kale salad to Thai meatballs and chicken tenders. It all looked (and tasted) so fresh. They have options for all sorts of diet restrictions and allergies, and a small shopping section with fun & unique juices, chips, and snack options.\n\nThe Thai meatballs and kale salad were TO DIE FOR, so fresh and so delicious--a must try...kale lovers and kale skeptics will enjoy it. I ordered a chicken wrap that was funky and soggy, and not the best--I threw it out because it just didn't taste nearly as good as my sides. The ambiance here is very cute, matching the food, a perfect place for that perfect Instagram snap.","259":"Visited sushi wasabi for a special occasion. This is a moms and pops kind of shop, very obviously family run. The decor is very unassuming and slightly on the side of an aging joint.\n\nThe quality is top notch and very fresh although the prices are shockingly high. The value is slightly lower than that of other quality sushi restaurants although this is made up in the freshness of the seafood. \n\nService is average and we would consider visiting again but only if in the neighborhood. Would not recommend for special occasions if only for the lack of ambiance.","260":"Great sandwiches, coffee, and service. Tennessee Trio was unique and had bacon onion jam.","261":"I went for the first time a few days ago and it still has a brew co feel with some updates. The food was super bland though and the service sucked because of the way it's set up. The servers brought other people's food over to us several times because they didn't know where it was supposed to go. I wasn't impressed.","262":"Okay listen up everyone...this place is where it's at. Aesthetic? You got it. Good food? You got it. BOMB drinks? YUP. Will your bank account be angry when you leave this place? Absolutely not. This place is so amazing that it almost feels like I'm there everyday..and honestly I probably am because it's that good. Tom the bartender? Give him a raise! James? Great service! (Watch out for ketchup around him) Overall, 10\/10 would recommend!","263":"A group of six of us stopped by the Cruisery around 8 pm on a Friday, and it was packed! Lots of young, hip people. The menu has some really fun cocktails, which were pretty good and very reasonably priced.\n\nAll of the beers that I tried were lackluster (especially the weiss bier which was the heaviest wheat beer I've ever tasted - and NOT in a good way). Someone mentioned that the beers they are serving are left over from SB Brew Co., so maybe these will improve as they get their own facilities up and running. \n\nThey provide games like Cards Against Humanity on the tables, which is a nice touch. Not so \"nice touch\" was the tables themselves - they're not entirely \"finished\" wood, and while groping around for a place to hang my bag I actually poked myself on two screws! Yikes. \n\nThe service was friendly, if completely slammed. My real problem with this place came with what happened when I checked my credit card statement on Monday - the waitress had very kindly agreed to split the bill among the five of us (although I'm not sure why we weren't getting separate bills to begin with as none of us ordered food), but did mention that she had some trouble ringing it up and we may see some pending charges on our accounts that would \"fall off\" after 24 hours.\n\nNeedless to say, they didn't fall off. 3\/5 of our party had charges ranging from $25 - $100 in addition to the correct charges on our bill. When I reached out to get a refund, no one called me back, although I did get a weird text from the same number brusquely requesting my name, email address, and last 4 digits of my card without identifying themselves. \n\nI never heard back after I provided the information, and eventually called a few days later. The woman who answered the phone sounded super annoyed with me, and informed me that it had been sent over to my bank but that she wouldn't (couldn't?) provide me with an email confirmation and it would be credited back to my account within \"24 to 48 business hours.\" No apology for the delay, apology for the over-charge, or explanation as to why I wasn't contacted. \n\nThat was four days ago, and still no refund to my card. Reading the reviews, it appears that this has happened to other people as well. If you do spend $$ here, be sure to settle up on your own at the bar - or close out after each drink - or you're in for a nasty headache!\n\nUPDATE: I called my bank and they had no record of a refund, so I am adjusting this review down to a 1 star. Will NOT be back.","264":"Great beer, great brewer, great food, great atmosphere. I recommend stopping by and when you do get their contact info. I cant find anything online","265":"Chicken tikka masala was disappointing, cubes of over cooked chicken breast in a sauce. Pricey for what it is... Samosa chaat was more like a stew. Hoping the next time the dishes will seem more like \"home\" cooked.","266":"Caviar, as we call it, is a regular destination among my coworkers, but I can only give it three stars due to the lack of consistency and the sky-high prices. \n\nLike others have said, Caviar has an excellent ambiance. I love the design sense of the space and would happily hang out here with a coffee (if the coffee were any good. Spoiler alert: it's not). Unfortunately, the quality and quantity of the food is just not high enough for the prices charged. The desserts have been very hit or miss--the flourless chocolate dessert I had once was dreadful--and the sandwiches range anywhere from \"delicious and perfectly grilled\" to \"tragic and falling apart.\"\n\nI'll continue going here for the convenience, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming from farther than a few blocks away to eat here.","267":"Had a wonderful evening at Totaro's last night.  Had a large group for a birthday celebration and it could not have gone better.   I had dropped off wine ahead of time as it was a surprise for the birthday lady.   When we got there they had set up the wine on a table with a nice presentation and had a couple delicious charcuterie boards on the table.  Although it was a busy Friday night, the staff was incredibly attentive and helped add to the joy of the evening.  The food, as always, was top shelf.   With ten diners, there were a number of entrees and all raved about theirs, whether seafood, veal, chicken or pasta, every dish was outstanding.  Thank you to all at Totaro's for helping make it a special night.  See you again soon. We promise to be quieter next time!!","268":"Had delicious pancakes. Nice place.  Friendly staff. Interesting menu. Was convenient to our hotel.","269":"It looks better than what you get. We were disappointed by it. The music was loud and we couldn't really talk because of it. Food is served on paper plates and my coffee was forgettable. Shame. We were really hoping it would wow us, instead it was like whoa .","270":"Warm and welcoming, a very modern feel to it with good food, good staff, good beer, good location good space and overall a good experience, the young man with the long hair well done sir!! but unfortunately young lady with the straight brown hair, smile it's good for you but everyone is allowed a bad day but when you walk-through those doors of a place that pays you, your problems stop at that door .","271":"All and all we had a decent experience however there were a couple of things that I wasn't happy with. I am not a health freak but I do try to avoid deep fried foods. Their bento box includes massive pieces of tempura and they refuse to substitute. That's a no no as far as I'm concerned. \n\nAbout 80 minutes into our meal the server approached us and very politely requested that we wrap things up as they needed our table. That's a huge no no.","272":"We came here for Conshohocken Restaurant Week with a group of friends. We usually only like to do the one in philly and were hesitant about coming here, but we wanted to see friends we haven't seen in awhile and figured why not. \n\nWe had a couple of friends who were late like always and had to wait for them. Our waitress brought out bread but not nearly enough for our huge table. We had to ask for a refill about 4 or 5 times. You would think by the 2nd time they would just bring out more so we don't have to keep asking. They also didn't even ask if we wanted to order until our full party arrived. I was starving by that point and wanted to just order since our friends were always late I didn't really care if they ate later than us. \n\nFor my appetizer I got the ravioli of the day which was a creamy mushroom. It wasn't homemade pasta  so I was hesitant about ordering it, but it turned out to be the best part of my meal. For my meal I ordered the surf and turf. I ordered it medium but it came out well done so I had to send it back. My waitress seemed annoyed and didn't apologize or anything. She took it back to the kitchen then brought it back without the filet and said the kitchen is making another filet but I can keep the rest of my meal while I'm waiting for the new filet. Well by time the new filet came out the rest of my meal was cold. They should have just made a new meal altogether. The manager did come out and apologize to me afterwards but was too little too late. \n\nFor dessert I got the tiramisu, it was ok nothing special. My husband got the cannoli and it was really tiny, they should have given you 2. \n\nOverall the meal was meh and service not that great. I think we are done with doing restaurant weeks. You are really not getting a deal if they are giving you skimpy portions. We've been to a few restaurants in Philly for restaurant week that gave decent portion sizes. I think we will just stick to going to Philly when we want to go out to eat.","273":"With no explanation at all, despite the fact we had 5:30 reservations, the restaurant was CLOSED. I received a call that morning, at 9:45am, but they didn't leave a voicemail. I called back, left a message noting I'd assumed they called to confirm.\n\nI called again last night, after showing up to a dark and locked, closed, restaurant. No answer, and as if 26 hours later, no return call.\n\nConsidering the reputation, I'm shocked and extremely disappointed in the events of last night. Luckily Fayette Street Grille was open, and was able to accommodate us.","274":"When I go to a BYOB I like to keep my bottle of wine on the table not on the floor like we had to and tables around us did also.  The tables are very small and to cram four people around one is not the way to start a meal.  I ordered veal Marsella.  The veal was tenderized like a cube steak so it fell apart in your mouth like large pieces of saw dust.  The presentation was not very appealing.  Pasta on the bottom topped with veal then asparagus on top of that served in a bowl.  If they wanted to present this way it should have been done on a large flat plate so if the customer wished to get to the pasta they could easily move the veal and asparagus to one side.  Sorry we won't be back.","275":"My name is Troy, this is my second time at The Cruisery with Riley, Michael and Avery. I want to first thank James Baugh for the incredible service and staff I'm all for that. We ordered many different things on the menu(all of which were spectacular) #heardtheyhavethebestwingsintown everybody that we know should come here.... if you choose another restaurant over this place, you're making a huge mistake","276":"Picked up a pizza on the way home the other night. It was great. Hot and ready when I arrived for pickup and very tasty. Only downside was the Crist was a tad bit crispy but not objectionable. Good stuff.","277":"Unusual (for the area) and fun place. Awesome atmosphere. You feel like you have done something right financially while drinking coffee here (pinky finger out). Menu is a little overwhelming, granola and yogurt is pre-prepared  but fresh . Breakfast burrito is good but I wouldn't order it again (side not however, I'm not a breakfast burrito type person... so...)\nCoffee is not bad.. late' needs more umph (yes, I know I could have purchased extra shots, but it was closer to milk flavored coffee IMO... shouldn't be the case). \nAll that said, I will be back soon. I like the place","278":"We were advised by Eric from Hotel Virginia to patronize this establishment as he continued to rave about this place with \"fantastic \" service, amazing cocktails and delicious food. We decided to take the advice and were so pleased! Great staff and loved the food and especially the unique cocktails.","279":"What a gem.\n\nStumbled in to get out of the rainy weather and wow. These guys are surgical, scientific, passionate, and they definitely take pride.\n\nDustin is amazing behind the bar.\n\nThey make a fucking amazing old fashioned, one of the best, and don't kill your wallet for it like where we're from.\n\nMy girlfriend that LOVES beer did the flight and then a lot more after tasting everything. \n\nThis place does it right, it researches, gets good people, and takes a lot of pride in being a damn good bar and restaurant. \n\nPlus if you're vegan, they have great options like the Impossible burger.\n\nIf you're in Santa Barbara, go. Period.","280":"Food is honestly the best Italian food for miles!! The atmosphere is so quaint and cute, and the staff is the friendliest and most personable people. Totaro's is truly unique and one of a kind that gives you a taste of Italy right here in Conshohocken","281":"This was the MOST disappointing meal I've ever had in my life. I love dining out and this completely killed my mood and opinions of this establishment. The eggs were cold and unimpressive, my biscuit was fluffy yet also cold and my \"fresh fruit\" was thrown together in a plastic cup. All was served on a paper plate. NOT worth $10. However, the thing that irks me the most is that I paid $8 for a frose drink that was barely 6 oz and my friend received a full glass. I blame myself for thinking I would receive a satisfying drink and regret ordering it. Overall, I came to this restaurant happy and smiling, but left angry and still hungry. Don't come here. It is not worth the money. This is a tourist trap.","282":"Cute spot! The decor inside is adorable. It was pretty quiet when I went on a Saturday. I don't think many if heard of this spot yet. Food was super yummy & they have lots of beer, drink etc. options. I  sat at the bar and the staff was super friendly!","283":"They have great chicken katsu sliders. The bartenders are friendly and always coming up with new drinks.","284":"Wow a serious disappointment. In fairness my review is the product of one disappointing Caviar delivery for three. Absolutely no service issues or grievances unrelated to the food (ie packaging, presentation etc). Quite simply the worst Indian delivery meal I have had in my memory. Insipid entrees, overcooked flavorless meats. I won't be giving this place a second chance obviously others might be more forgiving.","285":"Delicious food and cocktails!  The sourdough bread boule, asparagus and prosciutto salad and ALL of the tacos are my favorites and they have really fun cocktails too.  Great spot for a casual hangout and the prices are great for SB. Love hanging out there when I'm downtown. Service is always really good too","286":"If you're looking for a very casual and cheap brunch place it's the place to go. The food was subpar, not that impressed.","287":"Excellent! Went in last night and had a great experience. The ambiance is comfortable and they did a great job decorating the place. The food, drinks, and staff were all great.\n\nFor food we got the chicken tacos, chicken wings, elote, and pretzels.\n\nDrinks I ordered the fig infused old fashioned and it was great. The vanilla tobacco smoke was a nice touch.\n\nThe staff were all wonderful. Will definitely be going back!","288":"This place is so great!\n\nThe whole store is really cute and very well curated - it's exactly where I would go for a quick lunch between meetings, or to pick up a gift for a friend. Their salad station, sandwich station and wine room all looked amazing and I'm excited to try them.\n\nI also felt good about the parking situation. if you park in the garage directly behind the store they will validate your ticket.\n\nThis morning I ordered the Brunch Burrito with a side of grits. The burrito was DELICIOUS. Really tasty and well-balanced. I was initially unsure about the lemon component, but it added a nice zing while I was eating it.\n\nThe only downside for me was the grits. I ordered my burrito without pork because I'm a vegetarian. I ordered grits as my side and it turned out that bacon was mixed in with the grits. This component of the dish wasn't listed on the sign, and it would have been nice for the cashier to mention it since I specifically requested no pork on my burrito. They did happily replace it with the potatoes, which were tasty and much appreciated.\n\nThere's clearly a few kinks to work out, which is normal for a new business, but overall it's a great experience with a ton of great items.","289":"I was really not impressed. The tacos I ordered were way too tiny to be an entree, they should have been on the starters\/small bites\/tapas part of the menu. \nMy friends food was also pretty underwhelming. The menu really needs some works, but the drinks were good.","290":"Loved this brewery! Not only do they have great beer and wine but they also have a fantastic mixed drink and food menu. I had the \"Pineapple Express\" mixed drink that was sweet with a tart bold aftertaste. Along with that I have the jalape\u00f1o Caesar salad with a side of some chips and salsa. The chips aren't regular chips you'd expect, their more of a pita chip. Love love love!","291":"Was here a few weeks ago with my husband for lunch. We were on a mini getaway and needed lunch and cocktails. My husband had the wings and I had the grilled cheese...he had a few beers and I had the basic mules. All great but the service by Heather was top knotch. She was so sweet, caring and attentive. If we're in the area we'll be back!","292":"Great selection of coffee, teas and baked goods. The snacks are more health conscious but everything is overpriced. I got the chopped salad, which again, great selection of greens and toppings, but still very pricey. They also have kombucha on tap, which was tasty. \n\nIt's almost cafeteria style eating but with a modern and clean atmosphere... great for those who are studying or working away from home.","293":"Ok so if you haven't been here since they reopened and changed owners\/management, you HAVE to pay another visit. Will NOT disappoint!  Service is top notch, salads are the best....chopped Brussels sprouts salad and chopped Greek, delish!  Soups....fresh and so flavorful. Best part they ditched the nasty coffee previously served and yep, Frothy Monkey coffee!  Amazing!  While they are currently serving beer, they are awaiting their second wine license which I was told will have in next few weeks. Oh and another thing, credit card stations are at each bar (salad, panini, pasta, coffee, dessert) easy swipe and pay. No cash. I'm so happy it's been revived. Prime spot across from Vandy in Midtown!  Love it!  Way to go and will pray for continued success!!","294":"Beware of them just adding the tip without your consent!!  I asked the waitress did you add the tip because my amount was $75 but then noticed the screen said $88 like she just took it upon herself to add a tip. She then told me yes.  It didn't bother me much but then thought about it n called the restaurant just to make sure! I didn't call to make a complaint! just a simple fricken question about the tip!!!! The so called manager \" Dustin \" was so fkn rude a total prick!  The food wasnt even that great n neither was the service! The waitress that so rudely added the tip wasnt even the one checking on us it was a young guy who was professional n nice he's the one who actually deserved the tip!! Never go there!! This place will be out of business in no time I've seen all the bad reviews left about this place.","295":"The Bahn Mi Pizza is ridiculously delicious.  You might need to order two.  I'd give this place five stars but they don't have many pilsners or lighter micro beers.  Other than that, it's a great spot to check out.","296":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Edmonton. I'm originally from Japan, and I can say with confidence that they serve \"authentic\" Japanese meals you would normally get in Japan. My favorite maki sushi is their special role that comes with crab, grapefruit, avocado etc. - very tasty! I also think their tempura is the best in town - crispy butter. I definitely recommend this place.","297":"First time here and it's amazing. The open market style is fantastic. Different stations for different items. Jerry at the sandwich counter was great. He explained how everything work, even pointed out different features of the place. Food is great and fresh.","298":"Huge disappointing downgrade with the new owners. Formerly had wonderful gourmet salads with ingredients like poached pear and crispy prosciutto, sold champagne and little delicacies. Now they have a Southwest salad the likes I which I can get at McDonalds. I am so tired of Nashville restaurants starting well and then downgrading to what they think is more marketable to the Nashville pallet then going out of business. Now it's basically Panera quality with less built in efficiencies. \n\nIf you like Panera and want an alternative come here. I'd give it 3 stars under that standard and am downgrading it due to my disappointment.","299":"This place seems to be a new spot in town and I don't think they have it 100% dialed in yet.\n\nThe service is pretty good, but the menu and food need some work. The menu describes the food in a different way than it's presented. For example, they had \"lightly\" battered shrimp tacos, those babies were as deep fried as they come.\n\nI had the yellowtail crudo dish and it was incredibly bland. The only decent thing I liked on the menu was the Bahn Mi flatbread, and it wasn't out of this world by any means.\n\nI would suggest this place for cocktails only! They do have some tasty and interesting cocktails, and reasonably priced (along with the food). \n\nI have not and probably will not suggest this place to friends. I much preferred the SB brewery, very sad to see it gone. Good luck The Cruisery, I hope you only improve.","300":"Mediocre food. Bland. Tried the mushroom tacos and Banh mi flatbread. The cocktails were fine.","301":"Came here as a tourist because of its excellent reviews. Certainly didn't disappoint and was absolutely amazing. All the food was fresh and high quality. Simply a very very good sushi restaurant. Go ahead and give it a go and you won't be disappointed!","302":"This is a review for the cafe portion of CB (haven't tried the food yet). When you walk in, you're greeted by high ceilings and a very spacious area with plenty of seating. Lots of natural lighting and big tables which are great for hanging out or studying. There's plenty of outdoor seating too (with umbrellas). The only downside is the lack of outlets, but there is free wifi and CB is open pretty late for a cafe so it's a good place to study. I'd choose CB over SB any day... \n\nI ordered an \"Illuminated Mind,\" an organic green tea. The matcha flavors are strong, which I like. The drinks are fairly priced in my opinion. I paid $3 flat for the smaller size (silver) and it was pretty good quality tea. Next time I will definitely try one of the pastries or one of many assortment of snacks\/chips.","303":"Stumbled across this place in the rain. One of the few popping places with a Dj! Great vibes. \n\nThis place is amazing, from food to service!  We ordered the elote, chicken pizza, steak tacos and muffins! So good! \n\nThe server Sam and the manager James were so nice, warm and welcoming. Although they were super busy they were always checking in on us. If I'm back in SB I'll definitely be coming back!","304":"Drinks were good and so was the food.. We had a party of 8 and at the door we were told we couldn't sit together. Expected during a pandemic so that's fine. \n\nService from our waitress Olive was great until it was time for the bill. While at the bathroom she gave our first party, who sat across the room both our checks while we were in the bathroom. Which we can't sit together but we can be billed together?I have no idea what happened to the other part of the party across the room but I do know what I ordered at my own table. We went to the bathroom and came back not but maybe 2 minutes later (mind you we sat legit next to the bathroom so) to find 3 new people sitting there. Fine I can understand how the table would look empty. I go up to the waitress to ask to pay for the bill and to get my stuff back that was cleared from the table (dollar bills, hotel room key and mask) she was stressed so she directed me to a short bald man. He then tried to give me their bill. He was very accusatory and pompous, when I was only trying to pay MY bill from MY table across the room. I'm not going to go on because After reading the other bad reviews they've had the same experience with the same man I'm assuming to be the owner.\n\nIt's covid so I understand, the confusion and the chaos of the restaurant. So like I said my experience wasn't bad til the end. I never got my stuff back but the buser was the only one who took his time to explain to me where my stuff could be , aka the trash. Had to go home after considering I had no mask.","305":"Can we just have a minute to talk about how great this place is?!\n\nI was visiting SB for the weekend from LA and my friend brought me here. Tom & Gus are THE nicest people you will ever meet. \nWe had the Flaming Lips (AMAZING!) and a couple of shots that we asked Tom to surprise us with. Everything came out AMAZING. All of the staff members were so nice and welcoming, as well as the regulars here.\nI would honestly take the train from here every weekend just to go out here.\nThe beer was so good, I wish they sold it other than in the bar.\nBut really. \nWhether you choose the cocktails or beers, you're in the clear.","306":"Where do I even begin... everything starting from the service was absolutely incredible. We were greeted the second we walked in the door and brought right to our cozy table , with hot fresh bread & house made garlic infused olive oil already set with wine glasses and water. My dad and I shared sherry infused mussels & garlic clams saut\u00e9ed with oil as an appetizer (which my father loved, and he is a very picky when it comes to eating out at restaurants, so that says a lot). Entrees come and my meal was so spectacular that i was at a loss for words. I am both gluten free & dairy free and our server Victoria was very accommodating to my dietary needs and made sure everything was perfect for me. I ordered GLUTEN FREE GNOCCHI in a fra diablo sauce and it was to die for! This restaurant is the only place i have ever been to which offered gluten free gnocchi and it tasted just as if it was regular gnocchi.. my father ordered the filet with a potato cake and he ate ever single bite. Long story short this restaurant is a gem located in the heart or Conshohocken. I recommend the trattoria 1000% , any day of the week, any time of the day!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner and time with my father!!!","307":"If you want to try a new happy hour location, this is the place! The service was a little off, not the warmest but not rude or anything. \n\n\nThe decor is awesome and their menu has a lot of variety. I ordered the street tacos with no sauce (super tasty and the carne asada was savory and perfectly cooked) and a whiskey smash, which was one of the best drinks I've had out lately. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual and cozy and they allow dogs in doors, which is very cool and definitely a plus. \n\nThe decor reminds me of downtown Portland bars, it's great. Definitely give this place a try. I am looking forward to going back!","308":"The Cruisery has easily become one of my favorite spots in SB. The front gives you somewhaf Finneys vibes: restaurant, good food, alcohol. But the back area is truly where it's at. They have fun cocktails, great beer, games to play, and an awesome vibe. The bartenders are super attentive and quick! I come here basically Thursday through Saturday and Tyler has become my favorite bartender. As soon as you walk in he greets you, takes your order, and gets it right every time. He's a great conversationalist and makes you want to leave your tab open all night! I would definitely recommend the champagne Papi beer or the white claw cocktail they have (forget the name). Also, plenty of TVs to watch sports from either the bar, couches, or table areas. Now that they're serving brunch on weekends, I'll be here all day every day!!! Highly recommend.","309":"Ridiculously overpriced for food that borders on terrible. My husband and I both ordered sandwiches (caprese and black and blue) that were completely flavorless and tasted like they were microwaved. I used to come here often under the previous ownership but after this experience we won't be back.","310":"One of the best meals ever.  Surf and turf could cut the steak with a butter knife.","311":"Drinks we're good but service was terrible. Our waitress never checked on us. I've been here multiple times but service did not consistent. It depends on who is your waiter.","312":"Meh. The food is alright - service is awful. The associates who work here act like they do you a favor waiting on you. They don't listen to orders - ordered a latte HOT and came iced down. OK. Just poor attitude in my opinion. It's a shame could be a step above McDonalds if they put any effort into it. Gave it three tries - I'm out. Not on my list next time in Nashville.","313":"This place is amazing! The menu is full of tasty delights, and the drinks were spectacular. The fig-infused bourbon drink called the Fig & Haley has got to be the best drink I've ever had. My partner had the Aloe From the Other Side, and it was phenomenal as well. Service was super friendly, we were made to feel like family right away. It's kid and dog friendly as well, which was nice for our toddler (who loved the tempura green beans and the caprese flatbread). We didn't get to explore the whole place, as we sat at the front window for great people watching, but what I saw of the decor was quirky and fun and gave it a great atmosphere. Highly recommend a visit here, food and drinks are top notch!","314":"I would give it 3.5 stars because it is not bad food, good service, BYO and great cannoli's. Tried it twice so far and will go back but have yet to be impressed. The red sauce needs more flavor. I have had the fra diavlo and the veal parm both were just ok. Please keep in mind that I'm Italian and grew up eating Italian food, therefore I am picky. However if your sauce is bland then it can't ever be great. I want to like this place and I do think it is good but not great. The service and atmosphere is great there. If you are in the area it's worth going to but I would go out if my way or be able to give a high recommendation to any of my Italian friends. \n\nHowever the Cannoli's are great!!!\n\nI will be back and I hope it's better next time.","315":"I have tried to give Caviar and Bananas the benefit of the doubt because it's so convenient and the inside is really cute. But the food is so subpar and highly overpriced for what you get. The service really isn't bad in terms of the employees they are usually friendly but god is the food terrible. Picture of my \"sweet potato and kale hash\".","316":"I have been here a few times and I feel very strongly when I say this place is waaay to hoity-toity for my taste. I mean, it doesn't really matter what I say about the pricing because that has basically been said in every review on here. \n\nQuality of products is okay, but not great for what you get. I can't wrap my head around paying $10.95 for a salad. Granted, it can probably be 2 servings, but it is so inflated! Quality of food doesn't match quantity. I do not particularly care for their sandwiches nor the snooty service I have experienced.\n\nMany times I would come here because my co-workers preferred it, but I long learned that ship has sailed. Not my style. Kudos for free wifi.\n\nBye Felicia.","317":"Several bad experiences- not going back.  One time bad service another time bland awful food.  No thank you.","318":"Absolutely coming back to this place. Stopped in yesterday for dinner for the first time. Lamb samosa disappeared in about two seconds along with some standard, delicious, chutneys. We also ordered a Navratan korma which was pretty good and we ordered something neither of us had tried before...chicken Karahi... which was outstanding. The blend of spices with ginger and cinnamon along with well cooked chicken and vegetables was special. I almost forgot about the garlic naan which was fluffy, chewy, and savory - perfect.","319":"We strolled in here while waiting for our table at Nada next door. It was a Saturday night, and this place was very quiet. I think the concept is really cool, but execution is poor. First and foremost, there aren't any prices on any of the snacks, such as chips, granola, etc. They're just on unassuming shelves, and the restaurant owners are probably hoping you won't care. Plot twist - we care about price gouging. Second, having separate \"stations\" with different options was a cool idea too, but the menu boards were kind of confusing, and again, pricing was whack. I did like the idea of the coffee\/bar area by the door. \n\nAll I bought was a 10oz organic lemonade. It was almost $5. Yea, I won't be back.","320":"The very, very best Ahi Tostadas in CA.  Until Cruisery opened, the all time best Ahi Tacos were at the Beach-Comber at Crystal Cove State beach near Corona Del Mar.\nCruisery beer selection is world class, and you really need some great beer to match their Ahi Tostadas.","321":"Amazing cocktails, food, and service!!!\nOur server Kayla was so accommodating and gave us great  recommendations. She was a delight. Ahi tuna tostadas are bomb!! Tried and fell in love with the Plan-C and Pineapple Express drinks. Will definitely go back for another great experience next time I'm in Santa Barbara.","322":"Went in here hoping to find a green juice (either fresh or bottled) and couldn't find one, but they did have a large-enough breakfast menu with everything from steel cut oatmeal and overnight oats to breakfast burritos.","323":"This is one of the best place I've visited. Awesome ambiance, awesome food, the (free) sangria, the awesome stewardess, just everything about this place is awesome. I so wish I get to visit the Philly region again in life sometime so that I can dine at this wonderful place again....","324":"Me and the family were at The Royal Indian Cuisine a week ago and it was terrific. The restaurant had only been open for a week, but it looked like they had already gotten into a good rhythm. The food was excellent. The staff was friendly. \n\nWe ordered Butter Chicken, Lamp Saag and Malai Kofta and asked for it to be mild. And it was definitely mild.. which was particularly useful for our kids. \n\nThe breads and Samosa was perfectly cooked and moist. Will definitely be back.","325":"So we were at cruisery with some friends from out of town and Tyler remembered my friend and I from last week and then proceeded to greet all of us like we were his close friends. I've never been to a place that has been this busy YET a bartender took the time out of his shift to make us all feel special. He really made this game wild place seem like home. Definitely recommend","326":"Came for restaurant week. Just horribly disappointing. $35 for a soggy bruschetta, monotone veal on a bed of mushy pasta with flavorless tomato sauce, and a tiny cannoli with gritty cheese. Our whole party was extremely disappointed with everything we got. The servers were nice and attentive, so I can't give it 1 star, but I would honestly second guess eating here if it were free. Maybe it's better when it's not restaurant week.","327":"I've been here before and I've  had good experiences.  Today I decided to bring a friend here for the first time thinking I'd get the same experience. I was wrong. To start its Sunday and I guess the game takes precedence over any customer. The hostess tried to seat me and my friend in a sad corner away from anyone else as if we were diseased or something but seated us at a table only after I expressed my feeling about being seated away. The server while friendly forgot my friends order and brought his order late. We had made it known right up front we weren't here to see football but it seems we should have as other customers were recently being helped more than us. It seems ridiculous that we got handed a happy hour menu only to be told there's no happy hour because of the game. I'm so embarrassed that I brought my friend here after I told him this was a cool spot to hang out at. This is the last time I set foot here. Just plain awful experience.","328":"Just happened to check this place out! Awesome decor with communal  seating.I ordered Flaming Lips cocktail, amazing swear my lips were were on fire but in a good way! Will return for sure! Great service!","329":"We stumbled upon this place last night while walking on State st. We are sooo glad we did! The atmosphere was chill, fun and inviting. The food was great, the service was fantastic and they brew their own beer. Thank you for a great meal. We can't wait to come back!!","330":"This place is amazing! My friends and I were on a girl's trip and we stopped here because it looked so cute! They have doggie beds for pets and the ambiance is amazing. The food was sooooo delicious! If you're in the area, you have to try it!","331":"I was very excited to see an Indian BYO in Rittenhouse. Overall the food was good. I ordered take out and my main entree was mixed up with another customer. I had to return to the restaurant to have my order corrected -- major let down. The rosemary naan and mulligatwani soup were my favorite. The flavors were great. I also ordered chicken karahi which could have been much more spicer, next time I'll ask for a higher level. \n\nI will give this restaurant another chance but it left me still craving something more..","332":"This place is amazing! Loved everything about it! The selections, the customer service, even the store design! I highly recommend!!","333":"We ate here a couple of times, while staying at the Kimpton Aertson next door, since it was very convenient. However, it's a little pricey for my tastes and what you get. I had severe stomach issues the entire day after eating a kale Cesar salad with shrimp on it from here.\n\nNot bad variety of breakfast items, juice, lattes, coffee in the morning and sweet treats, like cookies.\n\nI tried to pay by cash and was told \"No, credit only \"\n\nThe friendliest person I encountered here was the young man who brought us our food items and was clearing the tables. \n\nOthers in my party tried the soup or a sandwich.","334":"Stopped by here on a quick trip to Santa B\u00e1rbara. Ended up coming in here because of the sweet hostess Alina. She was so kind and welcoming we decide to stay for drinks. Jake, our server was so great and helpful! Great staff and service! 10\/10 recommend!","335":"Great service during this pandemic! Outdoor seating is organized really well. Warm heaters by each table for the evening. Their bahn mi flatbread is outstanding! Great cocktails as well.","336":"Hakan the owner and Gracey watching NFL at the unbearable. GO PACK GO!! Amazing service and I love watching football here! The staff is really nice and warm!","337":"Delicious food!! Great drinks!! No complaints from this happy camper! I love the style of the place and the vibe it gives off! Will be coming back!","338":"The food was great, the service was great (it was a Wednesday) and the drinks were great! I wished I lived here so I could come all the time","339":"Caviar & Bananas catered an event for 50 and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Keri, the Director of Catering, was friendly, responsive, and had an impeccable attention to detail. The food was delivered exactly as planned, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. I can't imagine going back to the traditional boxed, catering lunch after this experience. We'll definitely use C&B and Keri again for future events.","340":"BYOB small italian restaurant, ambiance has the potential to be good however when we went, there was a large party next to us and it was VERY loud. The wait was so long, we waited close to an hour for our meals even after waiting 45 minutes to place the order. The food was not spectacular but in their defense it was a busy night for the chef. Lastly, you can definitely find another authentic italian restaurant in the area for less $$$","341":"The drinks were really good, but mostly My server was cool and I feel like we were kind of vibing? Anyway hanna if you're reading this my Snapchat is Shotgun420","342":"We are big fans of the sister restaurant Palace of India near Passyunk and Tasker. When we heard they opened a new restaurant near Rittenhouse we were THRILLED and finally made it there for dinner a few nights ago. We were not disappointed, the owner who we've come to know was there and greeted us like old friends. \n\nWe were not disappointed. We ordered the old standby Chicken Tikka Masal along with selections from our usual rotation, Saag Lamb, Curry Chicken and Mutter Mushroom Curry along with Naan. We were so happy to determine that to food at Royal Indian Cuisine is a good as the food at Palace of Indian. \n\nIf you are near South Philly, try Palace, if you are closer to Center City, don't miss Royal India, either will be much better than most Indian restaurants in the area, we've tried them ALL and few are as good as these two.","343":"This best Indian restaurant in Philly \nWe ordered chicken shahi korma \nLamb Karahi and beef boro kebab\nIt was so amazing, garlic & cheese naan was best \nExcellent service and friendly stuff\nDefinitely we will be back","344":"I like coming here for the wraps. They are bigger than the ones at Warrington Pizza, and you can get salad instead of French fries. I also like the roast pork sandwich.","345":"Great spot for lunch close to VU! Various lines to get whatever you'd like (salad, sandwich, coffee). I had the Nashville Hot Chicken Salad and it was wonderful! Big enough to eat for lunch and dinner!","346":"I've been here three times and everything I've tried has been below average. This place is trendy and decorated well, but when you have 500 different dishes to try from you can't be good at any dish. I had their \"most popular\" sandwich today and couldn't even finish it. I highly recommend choosing one of the 300 amazing restaurants in Nashville before wasting time on this place.","347":"The short bald guy (owner) is so rude and unprofessional. He aggressively grabbed and pulled my boyfriend out of the restaurant for walking inside to go to the restroom while we were putting our name in. He immediately freaked out and lost his temper saying \"get out of here\" and that he won't serve us now. Telling us that we are adults and need to \"watch the news\". He said there was a \"big\" sign out front that explained the new rules (about covid-19), which was a single sheet printer paper pasted on one door. Nobody inside the restaurant was wearing a mask so my boyfriend thought it was okay to go to the restroom quickly while we waited. This is all NEW to EVERYONE and there is no way that we could have known these new rules prior to our visit. There is absolutely no reason to treat us the way we were just treated. So embarrassing and he needs to learn how to treat customers. Seems like there is a theme of bad reviews about this owner.","348":"I think they have the best pizza in bucks county. The grand ma pie is also very good. It's crispy not doey, great crunch . the sauce is sweet and tangy and the cheese is fresh.","349":"I am so happy to support a local restaurant during a hard time, covid 19 is hitting hard to small local businesses. They were so accommodating and willing to work with dietary restrictions like being dairy free. It's nice to see a restaurant actually care rather than just be frustrated. Picking up our food and peeking through the window. We saw  l Vince and his daughter Victoria cooking, Ali taking phone calls and Donna helping prepare orders. What an awesome family business. So happy to have had a wonderful meal, and also to not wash another dish tonight at home! Well worth it.  The Totaro family rocks!!!!","350":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT! The food is awesome and the drinks are of the hook!! I recommend the Pineapple Express and the Mexican Cobb salad. My hubby recommends their Hoppy @$Fuck beer and the pulled pork sliders. Everything was the bomb!! Plus they're dog friendly. They have a dog menu!","351":"Horrible experience and wasn't the first time. Called in an order for my wife to pick up. She got there In 20 minutes and was told we never put in an order and was belittled saying we called another one so I called them and said is this the location next to Wegmans using my call log and was told yes by same woman who took our order and was told we never called it. I have the screenshot of my call so much for the customer being right. Will never order from them again. Has happened before and service is terrible. Who belittles a customer rather than make it right.","352":"The Cruisery is a fresh new take on the brewpub on lower state. The decor is updated and hip with an eclectic feel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful in navigating the new menus and talking about the spot's revamp.\n\nThe food is pretty decent, but not as good as the old SB Brewing Company. The menu is inventive, but pretty limited in options. Portions are on the smaller side as well.\n\nThey serve, beer, wines, and cocktails. The cocktails are pretty good! The wine list is pathetic given the large number of great local wineries.\n\nThe beer is meh. That was always the problem before and still the problem today. They're okay when knocking a few back to watch a game, but definitely not worth sticking in the fridge at home.","353":"We had a little Covid getaway in early November. Santa Barbara and The Cruisery could not have been more safe and enjoyable. Their blocked off portion of State Street is reminiscent of European cafes. We were there for \"Maui Monday\" and I enjoyed a Mai Tai (special price $7!) and we loved the delicious Maui tacos and bbq chicken flatbread (each a very reasonable $10). We met and talked quite a long time with the hard-working and very friendly owner Aron Ashland. We had a great time and hope to return soon!","354":"Been going here for over 10years and always happy with the friendly service and excellent food. Classically trained in Japan, the chef and his family return to Japan every year to visit family and immerse themselves in the culinary scene. So if you're looking for authenticity factor, check that off your list! Always give the specials menu an eyeball as theres always a myriad of succulent delicious dishes to be found on it and once they sell out for the night, you'll have to wait until it shows up on the special seasonal menu again. \n\nHighlights include: expertly balanced beef tetaki, sweet raw scallops, succulent sauced unagi\/salt water eel, smokey freshwater eel, salmon Toro- buttery taste with a crisp texture; Tuna Toro -whats known as one of the most sought after fish in Japan- melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Cooked highlights include their flavor packed shrimp tempura uramaki, gargantuan nebayaki udon chock full of veges, various seafood swimming in a delectable unami filled broth; chicken karaage redolent with ginger infused crispy batter; whole grilled squid that is perfectly cooked over coals.\n\nIt's a very small and cozy restaurant, so make sure you make reservations in advance to avoid being disappointed!","355":"Ambience and food are great. You might have a to wait a little on the weekends but the food and drinks are great","356":"Stopped by on Friday afternoon to eat, did not have any type of booster seat or high chair for a baby and then to make matters worse they wouldn't even let us bring in the stroller....you'd think when they said in response to another review they wanted to make everyone feel \"inclusive\" they didn't stand by their word! Went to Institution Ale brewery and received the best service ever!!","357":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! We got the frozen lips (some spicy frozen drink) and it was sooo good. We also got the bahn mi flat bread and it was the best thing I've ever had. I'm going back tomorrow for more. The owner is so chill and nice. Love this place!!!","358":"Was looking for a solid casual restaurant on State St with my wife and two teens. It was a crowded spring break evening. The manager Hakan (gave us his card) waived us in and made some menu recommendations for 4 finicky eaters. The food was very good from the carnitas tacos to the burger to the salads...all a notch above the norm. But what made the experience really notable was the service. Somehow our waitress Hana was able to keep every single table outside happy, served quickl, drinks and water filled, without a wait...she was there when we needed something, transparent when we didn't. All 4 of us remarked how Hana was the best service professional we've had in months.  definitely recommended.","359":"So far so great! My pup likes it here as you can see. Very comfortable! U think he is more comfortable than me.. service is great. Good had been excellent so far. Atmosphere is fun and vibrant. Come here and chill dog!","360":"Hip spot with fantastic cocktails and a great arcade with skee-ball, shuffleboard, ping pong tables, card games and more.  We came on a Friday and it was packed but didn't wait long to get a seat.  Good service, okay- fair+ food, good beer selection. Will be back! Heads up 2\/3 skee ball machines are broken","361":"Honestly we stopped to eat here because of the friendly staff in the front and the cool aesthetic, but we were not disappointed! As a non beer drinker, this place actually changed my mind a bit as their craft beers were DELICIOUS! Also really enjoyed the tacos and elote as a starter.","362":"I love the fact that it's a dog friendly place with dog beds underneath their tables!!! And the pretzels they serve u when u sit down are amazing!!!! Really spicy but amazing! When in on St. Patrick's day and the atmosphere was relaxed! The drinks were really tasty and the appetizer was basically esquite but still really good! Really great hangout spot for drinks!","363":"This spot was one of the best places I've been to since exploring Santa Barbara, it came highly recommended by the hostel workers as a good brewery to try, and they were right.\n\nI stopped in around noon and the place was also very quite. Had the bar to myself and chatted with the bartender who is a super outgoing guy, passionate about things he wants to do with his life, and open to a lot of conversation.\n\nTried some of the beers from the place which were O.K, not one of the best breweries I've been to in SB but great space for hanging out, great people who work there, and overall amazing experience. This gets 5 stars from me.\n\nHighly recommend this brand new spot on State Street!\n\nDon't get lost, you can find it by seeing the Bicycle Wheel\/Spoke hanging outside!","364":"The menu is so fun to read and the drinks are amazing. I got the Flaming Lips and loved it. We also got the elote,  beet salad, pulled pork sliders, and churros. Everything was great and service was attentive!","365":"This place was okay- my friends and I went for happy hour because it was on their Instagram post (posted December 29th)- and the server said they did not have happy hour. When I asked when they would have happy hour return she said \"I don't know\" and just walked away. Yet everywhere it's advertised \"hoppy hour coming soon\" so I find it very weird that they don't even know when they are doing \"happy hour\" considering they are advertising it at their own restaurant and Instagram post. Customer service was not very friendly which sort of dampened the mood. Food was mediocre- I did like the crack fries. We paid $25 for the impeachment punch expecting it to be huge- it was basically the size of a standard cocktail- slightly bigger in a pineapple metal mug- not impressed for the price we paid. I will say I like the creative drinks they have but I wish customer service was more friendly. We were kind of in a hurry to leave which is not a great sign. But I do like that this place has a variety of selections to offer food and drinks wise for people","366":"Dropped in to pick up a salad and decided to build one of my own.  Picked everything and the server tossed it for me (big plus).  Took it to go so it was in a plastic bowl with one of those really hard to remove lids (I guess it's not spilling!).  Salad was just good, not amazing.","367":"I really tried but don't get the \"a-peel\" of Caviar & Bananas.  First off, it's all metered parking or pay for the covered garage next door. So lunch with a friend ended up costing $8 to park. The space is large and open, filled with light and multiple places to sit.  There are three stations to order food along with to-go items and a small market area. We arrived before 11:30am so the first station was serving breakfast along with coffee & teas. I assume it would have a lunch menu after 11:30 but didn't check before I left. The other two stations make salads or sandwiches. There's the option to order from the menu or make your own, pretty standard choices and most things on the menu contain meat so not a lot of choice for vegetarians.  I decided to go with the ricotta toast.  To me the bread is the foundation when ordering toast and it can make or break the meal. This toast was two standard slices of bread from a grocery store loaf, so nothing special at all. Topped with ricotta cheese, pistachios and honey, it was filling but that's about all I can say. My lunch companion was equally as unimpressed with her egg sandwich. I ordered a hot tea, which was the standard tea bag in a paper cup of hot water. I assume the attraction here is the location, making it a place for surrounding business people to walk to for a quick meal. Definitely no reason to drive out of your way for a cafeteria style meal. Not a top banana and don't even get me started on the caviar 'cuz there's nothing fancy about this quick casual restaurant.","368":"This was not a good experience. We walked in and asked for a menu as we hadn't eaten there before. The hostess was wearing a shirt open with her bra showing. Like buttoned down to show her bra. My husband and sons were with me and we were all uncomfortable. We turned around and left.","369":"We had a fantastic meal! The service was lovely and attentive and the food came out hot and in good timing. They spaced out the appetizers and main dishes perfectly. \n\nThe chicken tikka Marsala was incredible, so tender and flavorful. \n\nIt's also byob. We will definitely be back!","370":"A go to for us. Always great consistent food. Reasonable pricing. Healthy portions. Easy parking.","371":"I've heard of this place but haven't had time to check it out until now. The barista who helped us was incredibly nice and was Merriam-Webster's definition of great customer service. She was super friendly, told us all about the menu as first timers, and personally brought our to-go drinks out to us. \n\nThey serve Frothy Monkey coffee, which is a great business, and I ended up getting the honey latte. I was sorta missing where the honey part came in, but nevertheless it was still a pretty solid cup of coffee.","372":"A friend and I recently came to the area and checked out a couple restaurants before ultimately deciding to stop in the cruisers for lunch. I'm so glad we did.\n\nOur waitress was super friendly and full of suggestions. We ended up splitting the wings as an appetizer and I ordered the pork sliders while she ordered the caprese flatbread. Everything was delicious and so were our drinks. \n\nI know everywhere in California is super dog friendly but this placed wowd me with their dog specific menu and really just the overall aesthetics of the restaurant.","373":"Gotta keep.this brief. \n\nOrdered dry wings, a cesear salad, and a veggie wrap (usually chicken i subed a portabella mushroom) \n\nI picked up visiting a local friend. \n\nSalad fresh and awesome according to those eatimg it, they (Sandy Y to the owners if reading this) order from here ALL THE TIME.\n\nThe wings are a frequent hit and made perfectly with nice sauce. Cooked as requested. \n\nThe real reason for the review from me was the portabella wrap with veggies was very very tasty and  suprised me with its el dente veggies and a wonderfully flavorful and textured portabella \"beefy\" mushroom. Chopped it was almost like chopped cheesesteak!!! \n\nI can taste and see why our long time friend and former neighbor loves this place.","374":"The Cruisery is new, so I figured it's worth trying, since it's in a great location on lower state. It's very fun inside, decorated with old wood and bikes. I believe that it's owned by the same folks who own Wine Therapy, and it's clear that they know what they're doing with decor and atmosphere. The fries were decent and the beer was very good. I especially loved the wings- a bit more heavily fried than other wings that I've had, but super delicious and juicy. Good service too. A good spot!","375":"A guy sitting at the door like a watch dog is a funny and bark off customers - management should consider it - this is really a put off and like you just hate people spending money here. That's all.","376":"Love BYOB's. Homemade pasta to die for. Great atmosphere","377":"So amazing! We loved everything about the place and how it's converted to a modern and chic place! \n\nThey had very interesting drinks and were absolutely delicious. We started with some beers, the blonde and the IPA, and got some cocktails. The aloe from the other side was delicious and other friends for other drinks as well.\n\nThe food looked amazing. I didn't partake but friends had salad and pizza. \nWe were there on a Wednesday and it was busy and fun. Our servers Olivia and Sam were awesome and super helpful!!","378":"Horrible service, the server Hannah told us we had to order one entree per person to have a drink there. So my date and I ordered guac and chips plus a grilled cheese. Grilled cheese was fine, however guac had a blackened layer over it which the restaurant tried to hide by sprinkling micro greens on it. Not a big deal but our server Hannah told us we are lying and the guac was not dark brown, she refused to take it off the tab even though we didn't touch it. She insisted on us ordering another entree since the law was one entree per person (which I have never heard of) after I said no thanks she brought over the manager that wanted to give us more guac that he said was fresher, I said no thanks. If a restaurant is willing to serve you old brown guac I do not trust them to remake it. All you have to do is stir it up to hide the old guac and boom you have food poisoning. I liked their craft beer but will never be coming back here.","379":"has a large Italian Stromboli delivered to my work. it was delicious. enough for 2 dinner and three lunch's. happy with order","380":"Wow! Best tacos I've had in a long time, the pineapple salsa added that little bit of sweetness. The Hazy Ex girlfriend ipa was really good too. My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich and he said it was really good as well. He got the armed strobbery milkshake ipa and it was not what he was expecting, but a nice creamy flavor. We were on our way to another place to eat when we came across this place and decided to give it a try instead and they did not disappoint!","381":"Jasmine Greg and Evan made my experience truly amazing. The atmosphere was almost as great as the drinks. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!!","382":"Enjoyed The Cruisery happy hour tonight! The staff was so friendly and kept checking in to make sure we were okay.  The food was delightful.  The presentation was so cute too.  We tried a lot of the items on happy hour.\nThe jalapeno poppers, kung pao sprouts, black bean dip, empanadas fritas, chicken caprese.  We even tried the brownie and ice cream.  I plan to come back because they had so many interesting cocktails, and there are a couple of item on the regular menu I would like to try.  The prices are really reasonable. I ordered the ahi tuna club to go for my boyfriend and he said it was really good (more than once).  I tried some of his shoestring fries (yum!).\nI can't believe I waited this long to try this place out!","383":"Maybe the best meal I've had in years. Every person in our 7 person party was amazed. Fresh and the chef comes out to speak with you about the meal. A keeper for sure.","384":"Let me start off by saying this is my first yelp review. That is saying a lot since I've been a user for years. \n\nFirst off I'm going to say the employees and service are great, this is not a review about the food, and hopefully not a reflection on the main dining room. \n\nI really wanted to like this place and have visited multiple times. Was excited when I had heard that they had opened the back bar once again. Being a local have enjoyed that location for years as a sports bar, Fig & Haley, SB Brew Co. \nNow one would think upon visiting, present date, that this is still a sports bar. TVs everywhere, tiered seating. Now come one of the biggest sporting nights in Cali, the Kobe Bryant remembrance game, I walk in no sound. Every TV has on the game, but loud music that no one cared about was blaring. We request the sound to be turned  on for the game. Now mind you this is 7pm, not party hour, not the main dinning room, not many people in the bar.  Another group of 20 people come in and also request the sound be put on. We are told that the sound cannot be turned on due to management. The manager comes out, or could be the owner, and is talked to about getting the sound on. They refuse to put the sound on and they watched 20 plus people, including myself and a friend, walk out the door losing probably 3 hours of sales from all those people. This is the same manager\/owner that I have seen taking a whole couch up  with his dogs and paperwork in front of a TV when patrons would love to sit there to watch a football game. Needless to say this place has lost a local's money, the people I would have brought in or recommended as a business to spend your time and money in. We are in desperate need of a good sports bar in town, unfortunately this is not it.","385":"Facility and hostess not accommodating to disabled persons. Hostess ignored request to speak with manager and appeared rushed. High stools not meant for everyone.","386":"Place totally blows. Horrible food of every variety. The dopey kids behind the counter are inattentive and checked out. Asked for a plain cheese hoagie for my son and the morons made him a cheese hoagie packed (PACKED) full of meats that he is allergic to. Found out after I got home. Total garbage. Zero stars.","387":"This place was amazing! The staff and manger are so friendly and the service is quick and efficient. The food was incredible, definitely one of my new favorites!","388":"A bunch of local Seahawks fans were excited to meet at the Cruiserys back room for the Thursday Seahawks \/ Rams night game.  We learned it's 21 and over so we were pushed to front room. The game was on but they were playing music over the top.  We begged the bartender if we could get sign off from the people in the restaurant, could we put the game on. We were so excited when he said yes! cool right! Flexibility! Except intervene \"he doesn't know our business plan\" guy, who rudely killed the entire plan\/vibe\/mission.  Completely rude and demeaning, unapologetic,no recognition a whole crew had gathered just for this (with 8-10x more people on the way). Well, if the business plan is to turn away local patrons, mission accomplished. Out of principle our crew will no longer be patronizing this new establishment. Rude, inflexible and 75% of the restaurant was watching the game (cheering when plays happened with no sound). We left during the second quarter and found a place that was both family and game friendly. Empathy goes a long ways! The manner in which we were shut down was so distasteful, I was astounded.  And reading a review earlier here, it's a pattern.  Unfortunately, while the servers were sweet, bartenders great, I'm one starring the \"customers fit unapologetically in my box\" attitude.","389":"Actually real Japanese restaurant, superb quality over time (we've been coming since 2006). Construction in the neighbourhood wasn't doing them a favour, but they prevailed, hats off. Really love their personalized service and understated attitude. Expect none of the Albertan obscene portion sizes, it's for your own good. Best and most authentic sushi place in town.","390":"I was reluctant to go here. Indian restaurants I've been here has been ok. Alright, I prejudged. It's very yummy!! \n\nOnly one waiter though. But after being there a few times I realized he's the owner. It's BYOB. I love the naans and all the dishes. However I never had any of the veggie dishes. But I'm sure they are good!","391":"Good service and good drinks. Dog friendly with water bowls & menu items for your canine friends. Tried thr outside seating on street street which had nice chairs and tables. Server was excellent and made sure we had our drinks in a fast fashion as well as correct food. Spacious but cozy with a nice view of the foot traffic & outside activity occurring in the city.","392":"OMG never having done Yelp I meant to give a five star review not a three!\nAbsolutely a must come brewery fun food experience ! See Hakan owner and fun master of this place!","393":"Stopped in at The Cruisery for brunch today and had a great experience! The food was delicious (Crack Fries are adequately named)! Additionally, the craft lemonade is SOOO yummy, we will definitely be headed back for more! Our server, Leanne, was kind and attentive. The restaurant was pretty busy and she was definitely hustling but made it a point to check on our table throughout our meal. Spectacular service! \nTLDR: Great food, Delicious drinks, Amazing service. 10\/10 would recommend","394":"Inexcusable--Never Again\n\nI reserved a table for 6 to celebrate my birthday with my family. The woman on the phone not only confirmed the date, time, etc. but we discussed if our party was interested in the Thursday's Game Night Menu (we were not) and I requested a round table (which she confirmed \"Yes, I'll give you Table #3\"). When we arrived, we noticed that the sole round \"Table #3\" was already filled with a party and worse, the hostess claimed she had no record of our reservation! \nWe protested and described the conversation we had about the round table, celebrating a birthday, etc. and she said, \"I'm sorry, it's probably our fault, but I have no record of your reservation\".\nAt that, she disappeared and the owner\/chef appeared and after more confusion and feeble apologies, he offered to set-up a table. We milled around for a little while and decided to leave. I prefer to patronize a restaurant that values their customer's business.   I've actually had this disappointment here before, but not with as large a party and this much humiliation.  Totaros have lost a good customer (6-8x per year).","395":"Lavender lemonades and empanada fritas for happy hour! This was one of the latest happy hours we saw on state street. (Until 7pm) The drinks were pretty strong and good food! We were able to watch the game for a bit before we moved on. The empanadas made us want to try the Brussels sprouts. Everything on the happy hour menu looked great! I'd be interested in coming back.","396":"ZERO STARS. \nOwner was incredibly rude to me and my guests. He pretty much yelled at us to wait on the corner until our entire party was present. A normal request, but in such a rude obnoxious manner. It was inappropriate and absolutely unacceptable, and from the OWNER. He was also rude to his employees IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT PATRONS. Terrible. Will never drop a dime in this place. Ever.","397":"Dustin and Jeremy (the bartenders) and Hakan (the owner) were amazing and super fast. Great service and good beer. Enjoyed the Hoppy as F**k. Good nachos","398":"So happy to have a Indian restaurant around the corner! Myself and two friends had dinner last night at Royal Indian and everything we ordered was delicious. We loved that we could choose the spice level. I will be ordering take out\/eating in again.","399":"Florentine omelet and smoked jalape\u00f1o grits were very good! Not so much for the coffee.","400":"The cruisery is an awesome spot in downtown Santa Barbara. This spot had great food and outdoor seating which is exactly what the doctor ordered for my family on this afternoon. Their fries were fantastic, they had great sandwiches and appetizers.\n\nTheir staff was courteous and helpful, the location was perfect for anyone hanging out in downtown Santa Barbara, and their food was really delicious as a topper. I highly recommend stopping by for a bite or some drinks.","401":"Absolutely beautiful interior. \nThe customer service is good. \nFood is mediocre. \n- Black and blue sandwich was very good\n- flatbread was way too greasy \n- chocolate cake was SO dry","402":"For starters we had not been out to any type of dinning from the initial Covid closure. Some of our friends had recently visited Santa Barbara and mentioned how neat the city had set things up for patrons to be out enjoying an outdoor dining experience with safety measures. I planned it and drove out to visit. definitely a pleasant experience to see how nice everything was operating outdoors on state street. We discovered The Cruisery and my reaction was to visit as they were serving lunch and drinks, while we waited in line to be seated ( which the patio\/ seating had plenty of empty tables) we experienced the owner turn two groups away and heard him yell at a young boy who was asking for water. My wife immediately became uneasy while I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. As we were next in line he approached and asked if it was just the two of us  and we said yes. My wife asked if she can see the menu and as if he had no time for us he walked to what we thought get us a menu, nope he walked away to go help serve some other clients. I get it, but he can speak up and pardon himself not ignore us like we are beggars. I immediately was turned off when he spoke to other clients like he is the only restaurant in the block ( rude). Clients approach to learn the service offered, we may not know where the line forms, where we should stand or if your short staffed and may not need any more tables filled. Sorry but not sorry, I will never visit you and my wife has shared this bad experience with others as well. There is no room for any attitude only for service and appreciation. Especially during some of these difficult times for business's and customers who are looking to engage in a nice experience. After all this pandemic is overwhelming for many.","403":"I've been going to Roma almost since it opened.  I have yet to have a meal I didn't enjoy.  They're pizzas are incredible and their steak sandwiches are incredible.  The garlic knots and wings are a family favorite.  You can't go wrong with Roma.","404":"Having a fun Saturday with the perfect food was a must. The tacos were amazing, with just the right amount of filling, so you didn't feel stuffed and sleepy after lunch. So glad to have come back for a second time. Will be coming back next time in when in Santa Barbara.","405":"I have ordered from here before and was satisfied. This time however , it was awful. My garlic naan was decent but my Chicken Tikka Masala tasted like chicken in Ketchup with some Indian spices thrown in. The ketchup taste was overwhelming and I hate ketchup so I threw it out. On top of that I asked for hot and it was mild- I guess you can only spice up tomato ketchup so much. My food sucked","406":"You can find a lot of good pizza in town, but this one is my favorite. The crust is always crispy and their sauce is top notch. Their Buffalo fries are wonderfully addictive with just the right amount of heat. Just discovered their breaded cheese ravioli, like a better version of a mozzarella stick. People behind the counter are always friendly during pick up. Highly recommend this place. Good stuff!","407":"Update-- response to the owner: I completely understand except that your employees let us use the bathroom and it still does not excuse your behavior and your servers behavior. Also, you guys were open for outdoor seating and she was yelling at us saying the bathroom is only for paying customers so....maybe next time respond with the truth please. And please learn to be nice to customers, as well as teach your employees to be kind to everyone. A hostile work environment is never fun","408":"Low quality drinks and food. Plenty of better other places to enjoy. Don't waste your money.","409":"Basically just paid $45 for snacks. I went in and they had no gluten free bread and did not validate parking. I couldn't eat a salad so I just had to get meat and cheese on a plate. All I got was that, chips, and a lemonade and it was $37?? And then even more for parking. It's supposed to be \"trendy\"? The staff is nice but slow and don't care; they just hang out and talk amongst themselves while customers are waiting for their orders.","410":"We stumbled onto this restaurant wanting to hang out and be somewhere a little different and we found it. Great atmosphere and you can bring your dog!  They even have beds for the furry kiddos while you eat and drink. Food was great and the owner was so sweet and welcoming!  We will definitely go back!!!","411":"Amazing beer and cocktail selection. Service is great and friendly. Their cocktails are quite creative and good. We didn't eat just drank but would finitely come back for their food which looked amazing.  The space is beautiful","412":"This was a great breakfast spot that was quick and easy. We were able to walk there from our hotel and they had various alt milks to chose from for our lattes, and really tasty pastries to get us going that morning. The seating is nice too because there are a lot of open spaces and I grabbed some gluten free snacks for the airplane later that were delicious!","413":"I met a friend here for dinner last night. We needed to meet in the middle so I found Trattoria Totaro on Yelp and made a reservation for 7pm. I wasn't sure what to expect but when I walked in I immediately felt like I was in someone's Italian kitchen. It's on the smaller side, but decorated nicely and it smelled amazing! We were seated in a quiet, cozy, candle-lit room with other guests. \n\nI knew when we started eating the bread that this was going to be some of the best Italian food we were about to have. I ordered the Pescatore and my friend had the Saltimbocca Chicken - They were both incredible! If it was socially acceptable, I would have licked my plate clean. The pasta is all homemade at the restaurant and they give you the right proportions - I didn't feel stuffed after eating and still had room for dessert!\n\nWe ended our meal with a few mini cannoli's which were also delicious and made in house.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be returning! Highly recommend.","414":"The Aloe from the other side drink is AMAZINGly fresh. Did you know this place squeezes all their own juices DAILY??  Wow, that is likely why this drink smells and tastes so healthy ... yet there is vodka in there to make it suitable for an adult beverage after a long day.  \n\nI also had the chicken katsu sandwich and it was excellent.  More sauce please ... for dipping. \n\nBartender was super kind and helped me navigate the menu.  He also whipped up that awesome drink mentioned previously.  His name started with a 'M'. Sorry, I have a bad memory for names.","415":"There were 2 bugs on the table that I sat at I had to change the table. That is when I should have left but I was feeling brave and I stayed the food I ordered tasted \"okay\" but then I got gulabjamun for dessert and I'm not joking when I say it was nothing like a gulabjamun it tasted more like a tofu. I won't recommend this place if you want good indian food go to Amma's.","416":"We visited Santa Barbara a couple of weeks ago and the Sunday we left we decided to get some brunch before heading out. The outside of the restaurant looks nice, tables set up with umbrellas to block the son. The food looked good so we went in. Cool thing, they have a \"Doggie Flight\" outside the restaurant. It's really just a bunch of bowls with water, but how cool is that. \n\nFood was A+. We mixed up and each got something different. I had the grilled breakfast burrito, it wasn't anything I've had before. I personally wouldn't mix black beans and avocado but with everything inside and adding some salsa, burrito was great. My wife had the avocado toast, FYI has a little kick to it. Now granted she doesn't do spicy but it wasn't anything too bad if you do like spicy food. Our friends had the chicken and waffles and the other a Basic Bitch plate lol. We added some orange mimosas and perfect brunch. Would definitely recommend, and if you go for dinner the atmosphere is even better.","417":"Okay so this place far exceeded expectations. They take an awesome location make it into a even better space brew excellent beer and serve super tasty eats. They're obviously taking their time rolling out of the menu and beer selection but everything was excellent. And their cocktails surprisingly great as well. I have some Mezcal pineapple cocktail with an IPA blend and an oregano joint clipped on the glass Rim. Loved it! Moved on to some beers from there.. batch 1 IPA with my favorite. Flatbread pizza was delicious cinnamon rolls were sweet hot and good, hot wings with Crispy and tasty, garlic bread was superb. I am really looking forward to coming here often and watching them grow. This is going to be one of the best State Street brew and food stops!","418":"DON'T ORDER IF YOU'RE HUNGRY!  If you're picking up and they say \"45 minutes\" wait one hour before you even leave your house. And if you get delivery and they tell you delivery is 45 minutes, eat a snack cause it will be an hour and a half at the least. They won't call you to say they are running behind because THEY ALWAYS RUN SUPER BEHIND.  If you call them and ask why it's been an hour and a half since you placed an order for a single pizza and no delivery, they will treat you like you have no business asking. Too many pizza places around that care.","419":"Out of all the pizza places in the area, I like Roma the best. They're unique from the other pizza shops around because of their specialty pizzas that they have to offer. I personally love the taco pizza.. I think that's one of their best. The service there is fine..exactly what you'd expect from a pizza place. The delivery services are perfect. I also prefer them to their sister restaurant, Roma II, in New Britain. \n\nWhenever you're feeling in the mood to try something other than a normal pepperoni pizza, come to Roma or order over the phone.","420":"When you walk in, don't be surprised if the host asks you if you want Indian food. There is a Chinese restaurant next door, and apparently many people enter the wrong door.\nThe menu offers very many choices. Four of us ordered about 5 dishes to share - fish, shrimp, chicken, and vegetables and 2 kinds of naan, and we thought everything was delicious! The restaurant filled to capacity at dinnertime, and the service was as good as it could be with only one server who is also the host. \nThe main reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is incredibly loud. People were literally yelling, and the noise reverberated to the point where we could not hear each other talk. There are ways the restaurant could mitigate this noise.","421":"Drinks where alright , food was good but nothing out of the world amazing. We were seated but weren't given forks till later when we asked","422":"The Cruisery is awesome. Hakan and Courtney made the experience really enjoyable. I had the chicken avo sandwich, which was great, and my friends had a bunch of other stuff that was delicious. Drinks were strong, unique and tasty. Ambiance was awesome -- love the area, love the new downtown vibe. This place is a great stop for anyone looking for good food and a good time!","423":"Absolutely amazing, fresh ingredients. Everything we ordered was delicious. Be sure to order the muscles in red sauce as an appetizer. We haven't stopped dreaming of them.  The place is a little dark, and tight but perfect for a date night spot.","424":"Love The Cruisery. The two brews I tried, the American IPA and Red Lager were well defined and delicious. The guacamole and warm maple bacon peanuts were so good! We enjoyed interacting with the friendly staff. Comfortable place to hangout and enjoy the mellow atmosphere.","425":"Great food. Great drinks. Great service. I've been here several times and everything has been delicious! And the owner Hakan has the best customer service. He remembers people, takes care of everyone and is generally very kind! Highly recommend!","426":"Very solid local Indian joint.  Some delicious more unusual items, like the mustard greens.  Too heavy on the ghee and cream as few very places manage to escape.  Very happy to patronize them!","427":"I'm from out of town and was so happy with this find! I ordered the clams, surf and turf, and peanut butter pie. AMAZING authentic Italian food!! The staff were so friendly. They knew the menu inside and out and were more than willing to answer any questions I had. It was extremely clean and has the most adorable aesthetic. I will definitely be back!!","428":"Found this spot on Yelp, the workers were cool the setup outside was cool, We had to smash burger the crack fries chicken salad all fantastic taste great crazy ex-girlfriend IPA was great the kicker was the mac & cheese definitely recommend one of the best mac & cheese's I have ever had.","429":"I want to support caviar & bananas since they have reopened but unless you happen to be walking by, parking is incredibly inconvenient. I paid $12 for a decent salad, $4 for an iced tea, and $4 for parking. They don't validate parking and the garage charges $4 for 0-60 minutes. Even if you want to pop in and grab a salad or sandwich, it's gonna cost you $4 extra. Not worth it.","430":"We had a great time at The Cruisery.\n\nAmbiance was fun and staff was so friendly and inviting. Had great laughs with the owner Hakan. \n\nMac and cheese was delightful. Nashville hot chicken was sumptuously spicy and exactly like we read about. They even have a menu for pups as well as a \"dog flight!\" (pictured below)\n\nThey have outdoor space for COVID safety and stay open later than most places in SB.","431":"Disappointing service. Lost a customer! I want to give zero stars but the app won't let me. \n\nstaff: friendly greetings at the beginning. Waitress was pleasant when she greeted us.\n\nservice: the waitress came and took our drink orders and then our food order. And then she did not come back for a long time. Half hour after our order we commented to each other that usually tempura is out by now. 45 minutes later we waved the waitress down to ask how much longer? She replied \"I will go check\" except she didn't go to the kitchen to check. She went to the computer\/till. She came back to ask - sorry which one was your order - after we told her she went back to the computer\/till. I went up to her and said - excuse me - are you just putting in the order now? She said oh yes I forgot and will put it in right away. \nI said we have been here over 45 minutes. And you haven't even check in with us. \n\nThey did not apologize and they did not try to offer anything to encourage us to stay. \n\nWe cancelled our order and went to YOKOZUNA instead!\n\nSadly will not be returning to Wasabi again.","432":"Victoria was a great server and started the pace off well at this small gem of a place in Conshocken. The celebration was my mother-in-Laws 80th birthday.  I ordered the rigatoni and my wife and family had a variety of dishes that was delicious.  Old style Italian in a small intimate space.  The conoll was also fabulous.","433":"I don't have a lot to say. But let it be known. That Nashville chicken sandwich is literally the best sandwich I have ever had. Coming from LA I have access to tons of places that serve chicken. BUT THIS SANDWICH HITS SO DIFFERENT. 10\/10 I would definitely recommend.","434":"My friend was just walking by the Cruisery and a guy was outside blocking the sidewalk & they yelled at my friend to get out of there zone & he apologized & then the guy said to my friend your a real smart ass , my friend ignored him and went and  ordered food from \" Hana Kitchen \" ( they have great food ) while waiting for his order another guy came out and my friend said to the guy that other people might get confused also & he told my friend \" your a breath of fresh air and you probably will die from cancer soon \n\nHow is that for customer service I want everyone to know about what happened and to think twice about going there","435":"Went here for the first time during quarantine, and I had an amazing experience. KAYLA is the best waitress and is so fast. Great time, I can't wait to come back!","436":"The service, food and cocktails are all amazing! Have been here a few times before for drinks but this was the first time we actually ordered food. The owner, Hakan, stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meals and had everything we needed. The staff are all friendly and attentive. The food came out quick and was delish! I had the Chicken Avocado sandwich and my fianc\u00e9 had the Nashville Chicken sandwich, would order both again!","437":"Not only does this place has amazing food, but they have amazing drinks and impeccable service. AVA, it's one of the best service I've had in a long time. She took such great care of us and was very attentive even though she was extremely busy. I could not recommend this place more, especially AVA as a server! You will not be disappointed!","438":"Everything started out normal. My BF and I stopped in for a drink and we were told we needed to order an appetizer EACH to be able to sit down and have a drink (in my recent experience it has been one thing for the table not per person) fine, whatever we ordered a coupe of things.. Drinks were great, our server was awesome, we were having a good time, but then... I had ordered a vodka & soda and it came it out flat with two pieces of ice. I asked our server (who was super sweet, sad I did not get her name) for a side of soda water so I could just add it to my drink. She came back and said the bartender won't give it to her unless she charges for it. (Which I think any establishment that charges for soda water is super tacky)  Fine, so we paid cash for soda water to add to my drink but then when I added it, it was still flat and diluted so I just decided to ask to have it remade. This is where things got weird. I walked in and was super mindful of keeping my distance, had my mask and politely asked the guy at the front (bald guy with dogs) of I could talk to the bartender, he rudely told me no I can step outside, I explained to him the situation and he was so incredibly rude and unfriendly but said he would send a drink out to my table, but then I saw him and the bartender rudely talking to my server like it was her fault. It was just a super weird interaction and left my feeling very negative about the ownership\/management. Definitely will not go back or recommend to friends","439":"Visited the cruisery this past\u00a0Thursday on a mildly busy evening on State street. There was a single\u00a0server working the outdoor patio\u00a0area.\u00a0\nThe wait was close to ten minutes while the\u00a0server and another staff member swapped out the patio heater's propane tanks. Once seated,\u00a0our\u00a0server was attentive, quick\u00a0and polite.\u00a0\nI ordered and quickly recieved a draft Pilsner. The Pilsner was cold,\u00a0crisp, tasty, with a\u00a0hops induced spicyness.\u00a0 I ordered the 'Smash burger' with bacon and no pickles.\u00a0 My meal arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were the shoestring type. They were tasty, well seasoned,\u00a0but a bit on the dry side.\u00a0 The portion appeared small,\u00a0 but maybe this was due to the shoestring cut.\u00a0\nThe 'Smash Burger' was complemented by onions,\u00a0a cole\u00a0slaw like mixture of greens, onions, and\u00a0two bacon strips on a brioche bun. The burger had good taste\u00a0well seasoned, but it was uninspired. I would give it average score, a\u00a0lower middle tier burger.\u00a0 \nYou can get a better burger on Denny's on upper State street, or at\u00a0Mesa Burger.\u00a0 Being a high visibility establishment on State street. I\u00a0suggest the kitchen\u00a0staff improve\u00a0the quality of this offering (and others?), to\u00a0something on the level of\u00a0 Eureka's burger in the Paseo Nuevo or Finney's on lower State street.","440":"This is one of my favorite cafes to get a super filling and delicious salad and I'm a huge sucker for clean, spacious and classy aesthetics. My mood instantly lifts when I come here - everything is just so pleasing to the eye and taste buds. \n\nThere are 3 separate sections in this cafe: beverages, sandwiches and salads. I've only ordered at the salad bar so I can't speak for the others yet. It's SO good and I've noticed that the majority of other patrons order the salad too. I get the BYO salad for $13 and they give you a huge portion so it's def worth it. I love how they chop up the salad in front of you which makes it taste so fresh and also easier to eat. \n\nI've seen people read and work here so it can be a nice study spot. There is AMPLE seating!","441":"We went a few weeks ago and the service was horrendous. We waited at least 10 minutes before a drink order was taken. We ordered the fried green beans which came with 2 sauces. One was over powering in fish taste which was nowhere listed as an ingredient. 45 mins later we still didn't have our entree, which apparently was forgotten to be placed with the kitchen. They only had one waiter so I felt for her but still. The manager comped our bill. We got the banh mi pizza which was really lackluster after the hour+ wait. The aesthetic of the place is cute but I would say go to Finney's or The Nook if you want pub food.","442":"Good vibes! Great service! Nice options for food and drinks. I had the burger and smashed the bun halfway through. Good burger though. Fun place alone or in big groups. Great corner location and interior chill ambiAnce. I'm coming back!","443":"If there was a competition for most creative beer names they'd win hands down! Also very tasty pub grub (shrimp tacos and the elote starter were awesome, and the burger was good. We sat outside nestled between powerful heaters, which was very comfortable. The servers were masked and attentive. AND the tee shirts (cute design) are available for $18.","444":"Tried to get into this spot with my friend and  baby, but the hostess said they do not have room for strollers. The place was fairly empty, and it was 2pm on a Thursday, not exactly rush hour. As if its an acceptable request to remove a sleeping baby from its stroller to accommodate a ridiculous request from the hostess. \nI hate to leave a bad review during covid when restaurants are doing the best they can, but this was a completely unrelated issue. \nThis experience begs the question: would you allow a disabled person in your establishment in a wheelchair or would they ask them to get up and walk? \nThen the bartender said its not a family restaurant, while there was a family with two children under the age of 5 sitting inside the restaurant with a stroller.","445":"came from pascucci just a couple restaurants up state, was sitting there for 30 minutes waiting for any kind of service and received nothing. i got up and left, lmao. anyway, i got the smash burger and it was absolutely fantastic. the beef had a mix of some veggies inside it which combined had a great taste. glad i ate here instead of at pascucci","446":"Wouldn't accommodate families. Would not allow a stroller on the patio. Did not offer or have high chairs. Hostess was unwelcoming and unhelpful.\nShe might have just been following the owners instructions. \nIf so, this place should be out of business.","447":"Ok so by far this is the best Japanese food in the city. Not even close. It all starts with the amazing hot towels that you can clean your hands and face with. We have enjoyed every piece of Sushi we have eaten here. Very fresh and well prepared and your rice or fish are never served cold (big no no) and the wasabi is as fresh and as real as it gets. No coloured horseradish sauce here. It's the real thing. If you go once you'll crave it again and again.","448":"I had the Chicken Carpise Flatbread and my wife had the Ahi Tuna Club. Both had incredible ingredients resulting in an explosion of flavor. I found out they serve late night, so a huge draw for the weekend bar rush. They took over the old Santa Barbara Brewing Company and now are proud owners of the oldest brewery in Santa Barbara! A fun casual place with a great selection of signature cocktails and their own home brews. They also have a great \"back room\" which is actually another lounge. Great addition!","449":"This weekend we hosted a dinner party for 17 family members at Trattoria Totaro and had an excellent experience. The restaurant was extremely accommodating, and allowed us to drop off our liquor and party decorations earlier in the day.  Throughout the dinner our server Ali was very attentive and friendly. We got family style servings of three different dishes, as well as antipasti and bruschetta to start. All of the food was fantastic.\n\nOverall we had a great time at Trattoria Totaro and felt at home as we enjoyed an excellent meal with our family. We strongly recommend this to anyone!","450":"Great cocktails, love the casual \/ trendy atmosphere, and the free pretzels (spicy) were delicious.  The flatbread was lackluster though; crust had no flavor and chicken tasted canned.\n\nIn response to the Owner: I visited in 2019 (pre-pandemic obv); had to move reviews over from an old account and, to my knowledge, you can't specify when.","451":"Absolutely perfect in every way. Love their manu and all the different options and sections. Coffee was great too! Space is very vibey, modern and bright.","452":"Great place for football. Plenty of TVs. Free Wi-Fi. Exceptional appetizers.Hakan the owner is awesome","453":"Visiting Santa Barbara for a few days and tried this place out since it was walking distance from our Airbnb. Plenty of great options for food and drinks! \nWe went with state street tacos with impossible meat and an ahi tuna club for food; and house-made sangria and a blonde ale that was on tap for drinks. We enjoyed it all! Great flavors all around! \nStaff was friendly and quick with service, as well as attentive throughout our meal!","454":"This place is awesome! I had the best time. Dustin made the best drinks and actually informed me on what cocktails to get. The floor is guava was sweet and was just as good as he said it would be. Cathrine also was my server and did an excellent job. She recommended the flatbread and Caesar salad with fillet. It was AMAZING some of the best food I've had in Santa Barbara!","455":"We love the cruisery and so do our dog. They are incredibly pet friendly with a super nice and staff, great good and location especially if you like to people watch. \n\nTo top of your pets experience dining  at The Cruisery, they have a pet menu of ground beef and mashed potatoes, filet with pushed potatoes or cheicken and mashed potatoes.  Water dishes and will even bring out a bed for your fury baby.","456":"I have just moved to Santa Barbara and is my first night out since COVID. My server Parker was very nice, brought drinks fast. I like fig and Haley. The food long time to come out but was good, I had hot chicken sanwich.","457":"First time visitors to The Cruisery - will be back without a doubt. The VIP treatment that I received was exactly what I've been hoping for my whole life. When the nice man Hakan asked my mom if we wanted an elevated dog bed for me, I knew I had finally found my favorite restaurant. I got all the pets I ever wanted, and my mom said the human food was amazing. She did decline the dog menu for me this time, but maybe next time I can convince her otherwise. Thanks again Hakan and staff for creating such a dog friendly place!","458":"This place is very nice.  I Rate my breweries pretty harsh, this one didn't feel atypical but they have a full bar, special drinks, in house craft beer and a decent menu. I'm giving it a 5 because I feel this place can cater to you and everyone of your friends. I 100% recommend the liquid sunshine! \nThe one peeve I had was the oil they used to fry the food(tortilla chips specifically) was rancid and in dire need of a change. But that might have been an oversight(let's hope).","459":"What a wonderful place to people watch, nosh and sip a handcrafted cocktail or locally made brew.  Their food is delicious.  Also they have a good Happy Hour: which made me HAPPY.  The employees were attentive and helpful.  We will be back!","460":"The Cruisery is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in Santa Barbara. As a doggie mama, it is very important that a place be dog friendly and this place goes above and beyond by even proving doggie beds! The atmosphere is very chill and laid back and the staff is all very welcoming and attentive. Cocktails here are amazing, they all have fun names and taste delicious! My go to snack is the beer battered beans, get them and you won't regret it.","461":"Great place to catch a game on TV and get some decent food and drinks. Food is pretty good, but can be a little hit or miss. Wings were good, burger wasn't bad, a little different from what most places have. The flatbread isn't really worth it. It's a bit flavorless and the crust is also a bit bland. Churro's for dessert were quite tasty though.","462":"Came here on a Tuesday night with friends. We LOVE Wine Therapy (same owners\/mixed staff) so expectations were high. \n\nThe food list is creative for state street. I thought the prices were reasonable, I can definitely see the other reviews saying they might be a tad overpriced but again this is State so they have to pay their rent. We got the salami & shrooms flatbread for $10.99 and chicken katsu with shoestring fries for $11.99. The flatbread was pretty thin but delicious. I've never had a chicken katsu sandwich and really have no idea what katsu is but it was pretty good. \n\nFor drinks we shared a Coffee Is For Closers and a Flaming Lips. Coffee one was Delicious! Strong taste of pineapple and then a coffee aftertaste. Rum, pineapple, banana, lime and cold brew. Flaming Lips was spicy and I personally didn't like it (like tequila on fire) but it was popular with the rest of the table. Next time we will try the Pineapple Express that comes with a mini joint. \n\nService was very friendly and fast (though TBF it was a mild Wednesday night). Waiter and Waitress were quick and attentive to the 7 of us. \n\nIf anything, I think the music could be 10 times better. Wine Therapy has this same problem. The music can be all over the place and I think a solid indie or 2000s alt rock Pandora playlist could really complete the mood at the Cruisery. I also think the wine menu could be expanded because we are in the heart of wine country and the offerings are minimal! \n\nWe will definitely be back to try the other mixed drinks and food. 9\/10","463":"I've been on a little mission to try a drink from every bar in Santa Barbara, so I stopped in here! I really enjoyed their ginder neutral. So far, that's probably my favorite drink I've tried in SB! Also, their firecracker fries & sauce are so good!","464":"I very much stray away from giving bad Yelp reviews as i work in the hospitality industry and understand how this platform can be used in the wrong way to spread negative disinformation about an establishment.  That being said, this was one of the worst dining experiences i have had in Santa Barbara.  This review is specifically focused on the long haired European owner (i believe he is the owner) who after many kind attempts wouldn't let me open my mini stroller out for my 4 month old to sleep in...which in fact i know is illegal in the state of Ca.  He told me flat out \" we are not a kid friendly restaurant\" and had no qualms about making sure i understood that.  There were literally 4 other people in the restaurant besides us so it wasn't at all a special issue.  The food was decent, nothing memorable, we got the fried chicken, pork sliders and mini burger.  The margarita was actually really good as well as our other cocktails.  Service was good, the hostess and server were extremely kind and tried to help me accommodate our 2 children but the owner got right in the middle of it and put a stop to it.  I'm pretty sure they are afraid of this man as i could see it in their eyes.  Make sure you don't go here if you have kids and think twice about giving an establishment your hard earned money if you're a parent and enjoy dining out with your children in a respectable and courteous manner.  So many other great options on State St that need your support.","465":"I had to use the restroom and casually chose this establishment. I was greeted by a brute of a man who asked me why I was there. I asked if I could use the restroom. He said it was not allowed and immediately began escorting me out the door. I showed zero resistance and stated it wasn't necessary for him to escort me in such a hastily manner. His response was that my presence was against the law. He was not kind nor friendly. I haven't been to Santa Barbara in a while, I guess I need to read up on the laws. Smh","466":"Great Beer and food at the Cruisery. \nExcellent service, nice outdoor seating as well as indoors.","467":"Small BYO spot close to the park. Delicious, the food compared to other spots in the area is much fresher and has way less holding time. Big fan of their vindaloo recipe. Garlic naan was piping hot and tasty. Prices are high, but understandable given the area.","468":"Best Italian in Conshohocken hands down, people in here saying there are comparable places in town have no idea what they're talking about. Yes it takes a while for the food to come out, the place is small and family run they aren't trying to grow it into a franchise, and that's exactly why it's so good. We've tried most of the things on the menu, and never been disappointed. The veggie lasagna and sacchetti milano are one of a kind, and all of their staples never disappoint. Don't let a few people who think Buca Di Beppo and Applebees are first class food dissuade you, Trattoria is worth every minute and penny.","469":"I love their late night happy hour! The sangria is so tasty! We also ordered the quesadilla which needed some guacamole or salsa for additional flavor. The chicken caprese flatbread was great though! The bar has great vibes but our bartender was not very friendly and was ignoring us most of the night. We will still come back though!","470":"This place recently re-opened. I really liked it before but am now less than impressed. Menu is completely changed and parking isn't validated anymore! With parking not validated, it made my already overpriced salad become even more expensive. I probably won't be visiting often like I used to before. Parking is already a pain in Midtown and that garage is already a mess. Until they figure that out, I don't think it's a place you must visit.","471":"What an amazing new gem on state street the cocktails are to die for and the bartenders are knowledgeable and fun! Not to mention DOGS EVERYWHERE would recommend Nick & Manny are the sh*t","472":"I'm so happy to find this place open during Easter weekend. Food was good and service was great too.  Must try the fresh squeezed lemonade it is so good!!!  Would definitely comeback again next time when visiting Santa Barbara.","473":"This place was right next to our hotel and had a great assortment of coffees and teas. We were impressed with the decor and feel of the restaurant. Food was a good portion and we shared a lot of different entrees! Had a wonderful time!","474":"This place is absolutely a gem. Fun decors, drinks, and atmosphere. Our server, Alessandra was great. We met with the owner, Hakan as well as pictured here. He is such a great host and individual. We will be definitely returning back here and will recommend this spot to friends\/family. Cheers!!","475":"If you are looking for a good time this is the place to be. Although, you might be fooled by the front of the state street entrance. The trick is to go to the back room. They have tons of games and a bar! They have dominos, skee ball, pin pong and much more. The Cruisery is also a cool spot to catch the game. Not only is this up and coming brewery a sweet place for fun and games but it is also a great place to catch a brew or a bite to eat. I would have to say this is a fantastic place to go for a first date. No need for awkward conversations when you have all these good brews and fun games!","476":"I've given this place a second and third chance and each time something is just a little bit sub-par. Sometimes the service is great, but the food is bad or the food is good, but the service isn't. I'm usually a pretty easy-going customer, but I've decided not to give Cruisery a fourth chance. It's an expensive tab for an alright place.","477":"What a killer restaurant! My kids and I road our beach cruisers up and got a table outside. We ended up meeting Hakun the owner and talked to him about bikes, travels, places to see and Turkey. Thank you for giving us such a great dinner and experience. One of the coolest places I've seen in the states.","478":"If you employ a 'market concept ' restaurant then organize it better. There are three separate food spots but you can only order beverages from one. So, stand in line for coffee and beer, then another if you want sandwiches. The food is okay but not worth the order hassle. On top of that our order was forgotten so we had to alert the manager. They did take care of us but it is not worth another visit.","479":"Sushi Wasabi is a small restaurant tucked away in a busy strip mall on 111 street. They are not currently open for dine-in service but takeout is still a great option. We were able to walk-in and place an order for pickup within 30 minutes on a weekday evening.\n\nThey offer quite a few traditional vegetarian options. My favourite is their yam tempura roll which is flavourful and perfectly crispy. All of their rolls are fresh and tasty. The rice is never crumbly.\n\nSushi Wasabi is probably my favourite sushi spot on the southside of the river. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for some delicious handmade sushi.","480":"Amazing drinks in cute glasses, and awesome service. The food looked good too but we came in for booze and the nice decor. Love how dog-friendly it is. Free pretzels with alcohol. Big communal tables, but smaller - more intimate places to eat too inside.","481":"Ordered chicken cheesesteaks with extra cheese. One with fried onion. The sandwiches were tasty, but the one with fried onions had onions, not fried. \nAlso ordered curly fries and sweet potato fries which were very good. Delivery took about 40 minutes. \n\nOk, but not fantastic.","482":"Desperately looking for open restaurants later on a Sunday night (around 9:20). This spot was open till 10, so confirmed via phone call and headed there as quickly as possible.\n\nWe arrived with half an hour to spare but at that point they were only doing takeout orders. Quickly went through the menu and ordered the Chili Chicken ($13) and Garlic Naan ($4). Food was ready after about 10 minutes - tightly packed in a to-go back, and thankfully with utensils after asking. Chili chicken is a large serviced of sliced chicken marinated in chili paste, tomato ketchup, and other spices. The overall taste is sweet because of all the tomato ketchup, with some spicy follow-through. Naan is your basic fare, not too much garlic but went well to scoop up the chicken.\n\nWas hoping for a sit-down meal, but they seemed ready to close out for the night. Plenty of options to choose from here, so could be hit or miss.","483":"Watch your bank\/credit statements! Will start by saying the food and service was fine. However, payment time comes, and the bill was split amongst 3 cards and part cash. Everyone signed their slips, the tip was cash and all was good. Come to find out, the one card was charged the ENTIRE bill. Not sure how this happens. Called and was told this would be passed onto the boss, but nothing has been solved at the moment.","484":"I stopped there with a friend later in the evening, when we just needed to get some food after an afternoon of walking around the city. The service was really slow (~30 min to get a check). They screwed up on the order and took longer than expected (that's in addition to waiting for the check). Then, we got billed twice! The first charge was wrong -- had double the amount and then after they corrected, they didn't cancel the first charge. \nThe atmosphere was nice, but nothing out of ordinary. \nThe food was just OK. Maybe it's just a place for drinks? We didn't have any drinks, so can't comment on that. \nIf you go, check your charges before paying!","485":"Recently checked out The Cruisery with my daughter on a Thursday afternoon for lunch.\n\nWe were seated by a kind gentleman on the street patio in the shade and were given water and menus to look over. \n\nI love hot wings so I wanted to try theirs out, but my daughter doesn't like too spicy of things, so our server kindly suggested a 50\/50 order of the two types so she could have some. When we received them, the winner was definitely the Thai Sweet and Spicy wings. They were both decent but not tender, they were fried versus bakes, and I prefer wings that  are baked in an oven over deep fried. It just dries them out under all the sauce. \n\nMy daughter was trying to limit her gluten and dairy, and ordered the Vegan Impossible Tacos. They were extremely dry and the chipotle sauce was HOT. We should have asked how hot it was but considering we had just discussed the fact that she didn't like too much spice, it would have been helpful if our server had mentioned that. Upon receiving them and giving that feedback, no offering of redoing them was done. So we just picked off as much of it as we could. \n\nI ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad. I wasn't impressed at all. It was a cheap lettuce and tasted like something I myself would throw together at home with whatever leftovers I may have had. There was hardly any flavor but was very spicy. I normally love heat but with no flavor it's just imbalanced. \n\nOverall the service was good. We went to use the restroom before we left and had a weird experience with some guy in a backpack who had just walked in carrying a plant who didn't look like he even worked there at all. I appreciate that we are still dealing with Covid right now but indoor dining IS allowed and the number of aggressive questions I got while just trying to walk to the bathroom with my young daughter was off putting. It left a bad taste in our mouths. Almost like we were doing something wrong.\n\nIt just didn't hit the mark for us, so I doubt we will go there again. Maybe we just hit them on a bad day?","486":"I'd love for this review to be 5-stars and highlight the games, food, drinks, and general ambiance that the Cruisery has to offer. I'd heard pretty good things about the place, and my wife, friends, and I agreed that we should head there for a bit of a Sunday funday.\n\nWell, our visit was cut short and there was no fun to be had...at least at this stop. \n\nWe walked into the back room of the Cruisery where there were 15 people present, along with 10 large screen TV's, a bunch of empty tables, and some empty couches. A few football games were on and we figured we'd pull up a couch and watch the U.S. Open tennis finals at one of the many unwatched TV's. There are at least a few of us who'd rather watch a U.S. Open tennis finals match instead of the first game of the football season. \n\nWe asked the bartender if he'd put the tennis match on one of the TV's that no one was watching. He left, and a few minutes later returned, saying that the general manager said all TV's were reserved for football games. \n\n\"Really? ALL the TV's?\" we asked. \n\n\"Yup.\"\n\nThat was it. No apologies, no alternate solutions or suggestions...kinda weird. You'd think that maybe they could have offered one (or 4?) of the non-viewed screens to other non-football sports. Especially with no one else there. \n\nBut alas, it was not to be. We walked out less than three minutes after walking in, taking our business to Paxti's up the street for some food, brews, mimosas, pizza, and tennis in what is arguably a better environment (read: indoor\/outdoor bar) and a pleasant atmosphere. \n\nYes, I'll probably try the Cruisery at some point again in the future, but so far they're at one strike...and 1 star.","487":"Fantastic spot, large menu and everything we tried was really great! The cocktails were also prepared well and had great presentation. There was only one server but she was doing a great job taking care of everyone quickly and efficiently. We definitely will be coming back to sample some more of the food!!","488":"Love my decaf cappuccino with almond milk every morning! I have it in a huge mug! Great pastries and bagels! Beautiful location and friendly staff!","489":"James said he was going to be at O'Malley's at 9:51 pm\nAll we got was a sock full of ketchup. 10\/10 would still recommend.","490":"Came here at lunch at the invite of B day boy A-ron. The food was fantastic. Try the corn. My... service dog is welcome which is always my go to when choosing eateries. Even the ice is good, (crushed). Definitely worth checking out to see if it's your kind of spot.","491":"We went to The Cruisery on Sunday and had such an amazing time! We loved sitting outside on State St. under the umbrellas. There was a band playing and it was just a blast. The Pineapple Express cocktail is a must! We highly recommend!","492":"My boyfriend, sister and I came in to use our axxess card and were so impressed with the atmosphere, the drinks and our waiter Djana. We had such a nice time and really enjoyed our afternoon at cruisery. High recommend this bar for a quick bite and fun twists on classic cocktails! She made great recommendations about the menu and was knowledge about Santa Barbara.","493":"This place is AMAZING! The drinks are very unique and creative and the food is delicious. I have tried most of the cocktail menu and liked each one, however I especially enjoyed the Fig & Haley which is their take on an old fashioned with a few additional layers of flavor that make it very approachable to people who don't drink cocktails often. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and casual which makes it feel like a second home where you can hang out for as long as you'd like. \n\nAll in all this was a great addition to state street and each time I've gone I've been impressed with how busy it is for such a new restaurant. My girlfriend and I will be returning as often as we can.","494":"This was awesome. We had delicious beer and tasty food. They even gave me a free beer in the middle of my meal. Would definitely come again.","495":"I was traveling through Santa Barbara, tired from a long drive with my wife and her terrible music. We decided to get a hotel on our way to San Diego and wanted to eat somewhere decent and see the city. So we decided eat at the Cruisery. The hostess was great but our waiter Kayla seemed to have no interest in doing her basic duties as a server. She, after a long while took our orders in a rude tone. Was extremely short with us and almost sassy. An hour later our food came and the orders were wrong. We asked to leave with no food and she tried to force us to pay. SHE HELD US HOSTAGE. In fear for my life I tipped a hundred bucks and got my wife out of there. Needless to say due to trauma we never made it to San Diego. Please I beg you do not eat here!!!!!","496":"The food is nice and it's very dog friendly! We have two corgis and we sat outside. The service is A star! They got all our request even before we say. Appreciate their attention to details! Love the place the make us love Santa Barbara.","497":"Absolutely delicious food! The best Italian restaurant I've been to and some of the best Italian cooking I've had ( obviously second to my grandma who's was off the boat Italian). The waitresses are very personable and thoroughly care about the customers. We all had veal dishes with the exception of my girlfriend(who had ravioli), all of the food was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. This was a great birthday dinner! (Place is small(but comfortable) so make sure you make a reservation). If you want really good Italian food, come here!","498":"I stumbled upon this gem earlier this evening. As a long time Santa Barbara local I am thrilled to finally have a real local quality \"Brew Pub\" on lower state street. I had been to the previous Santa Barbara Brewing Company in the past and didn't much care for it. The Cruisery brings this place to a whole different class. The food is spectacular and unique, we had the Bohn Mi flatbread and buffalo wings. Both were great. The wings I'd have to say are hands down the best in Santa Barbara. I had the Steak Friet as well. The steak was cooked perfectly as request (seems to be difficult for a lot of restaurants). I had the IPA brewed in house which was fantastic. The Pineapple Express cocktail is delicious and borderline hilarious with its garnish (you'll have to order and see why). I also got the Old Fashion which is completely unique, I'm not sure what they did but it involves fire and is fun to watch. This place is truest unique and I'd highly recommend it.","499":"The Katsu Sliders were fantastic and the Blackened Chicken sandwich my wife had was equally impressive. And the Hoppy @$ Fuck IPA was great.","500":"Food came fast, atmosphere was bliss, drinks went down smooth too! Serve was swift and we will be back! We live in the area and will bring family that visit by here as well. O! Welcome guacamole and salsa was FIRE! YUM!","501":"My name is also Kat but if you need anything talk to CAT! She is the absolute best server. Helped me out twice tonight and is absolutely lovely human being and a great server. Ask for Cat, and your night cannot go wrong. Thank you again!","502":"We used to love this restaurant.  Went to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries.  Last time we dined in pre-COVID was one year ago, January 2020 and our meals were out of this world.  We went for dinner last week and were somewhat disappointed.  While the appetizers were delicious, the steak did not seem fresh and did not taste right.  Not the same experience compared to one year ago.  We have noticed other restaurants have changed as well and we can only speculate that perhaps older inventory is being served and the quality standard decreased.  I hope what was once our favorite place does not become another casualty as a result of COVID.  It's a shame.","503":"Came here for restaurant week and it was lovely. Outdoor seating was very cute and socially distant which is important these days. \n\nOur server was great - friendly, nice, and attentive. \n\nFood was delicious: I got the Cesar salad, chicken parm, and the blueberry chocolate vanilla cake dessert. I think it was a special, but it was divine. \n\nMy company gets take out from here at work sometimes as well and their lunch salads are delicious. This is a great spot!","504":"Sean is the man! Super cool, he explained the different brews and was super quick with service.","505":"Super great service. They know the munes - food\/on premises brewed beer\/cocktails and can provide great descriptions and recommendations. \n\nGo for the ahi tostadas, grab a Hazy Ex-Girlfriend, and finish with Fig and Haley.","506":"Creative cocktails and great beer. Food is a huge improvement from the previous business that changed ownership\/management here. Loved the bahn mi flat bread and wings. The portabella tacos we're also delicious, just need to remember to ask for a side of salsa next time. Service was excellent. Had a great experience and will be back to try more items on this menu!","507":"My husband and I live a mile away,  so we walked.  It's good.  It's not great.   It is lovely and clean, but felt cold and sterile to me.  It's actually like sitting in a food court at Abu Dhabi's airport.   I got the salmon, kale salad  and beets.  All were fine, but not worth returning for.  My husband got a cheese board--just fine.  We have so many wonderful restaurants in Nashville and I really wanted to love this place because we can walk.  May give it a second try for breakfast.","508":"I've dined at Caviar and Bananas on several occasions. I guess it is the desserts that keep me coming back. I have ordered salads and sandwiches and they were good. Yes they are a bit pricy but then many of Nashville's trendier restaurants are and even some of the less trendy. I would go back because I can get a good salad and sit down and enjoy it while I am on my lunch break. The atmosphere is fantastic. The staff super friendly and helpful. I am only knocking off one star because they are pricy. I would recommend them for sure. My only real negative comment would be they have no way of assuring that the food people eat is being paid for. It is based on the honor system. Students love to dine and dash. Easy way to loose lots of money.","509":"This place is fantastic. Service all the way 5 Star. Hakan, the GM super friendly. Even our baby Sonny loved the attention. I highly recommend the place. Great food, drinks and fantastic vibe! For sure, we will coming back! Thank you for Hakan and his fantastic team!","510":"We took friends of our there this past Saturday night 3\/6 for dinner. Due to Covid we hadn't been here in a while. Nothing has missed a beat! This place is as fantastic as it ever has been. Our server Victoria was attentive to our every need.  The food...\"Ottimo!!\". The best Italian food in the area...and it is a BYOB too boot. Try it....you won't be disappointed.","511":"This is very random but my review may be helpful to some at some time. My wife and I were looking for a place to watch the NBA finals ('19) as well as listen to the game itself. After walking up, down and around State St. And getting turned away by 4 bars we finally were directed to check out The Cruisery. They not only turned the game on but The volume on as well ! At the end of the night we were very impressed not only with the food, hand crafted drinks and the service that we totally forgot about how we even stumbled onto this place. Can't wait to visit this place during football season!","512":"What a wonderful BYOB Real Italian in Conshohocken- voted best BYOB for years and a good reason. The food and service is awesome! We met for lunch, brought some nice IPA in a growler and split a large salad, an Italian hoagie and some mussels fra diavola. Then finished with some cannoli and espresso. The whole meal came to 40$ which is very fair and hey it's BYOB. Along the large menu they also offer daily changing lunch specials. We are back soon for lunch or dinner!","513":"Five stars for succeeding at being exactly what they are- a neighborhood trattoria. It's got a nice homey feel and the servers seemed to know every customer. We decided to try out their \"Godfather\" themed dinner, so I can't speak to the regular menu, but everything we ordered was delicious. We started with the wagyu beef, caramelized onion, and Gorgonzola crostini and Caesar salad. Absolutely loved the crostini and the salad was very good if a little underdressed. I got the pescatore pasta with red sauce- they did NOT skimp on the seafood (mussels, clams, crab, calamari, and shrimp) which I appreciated! My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs, which I assume he enjoyed because he devoured it and I never got a bite. For dessert we got the chocolate peanut butter pie and the cannoli Grandma's cake- both were to die for! It's BYOB, so don't forget to bring a bottle or three. They're doing a good job with COVID protocol (masks, etc) and heated outdoor seating is available. We can't wait to go back and eventually be regulars like seemingly everyone else!","514":"This place is my new go to pizza place. Love the pizza here. We come here a least once a week.","515":"Great spot to check out. The atmosphere is nice and food is great. I got their BBQ Chicken salad which was good. They have a lot of great options but their menu system is weird. They have stuff not on the menu but you have to ask for it and the wait will say of ya we have that. Soooo it's a little confusing but overall it was a good time.","516":"Fantastic service. I was just walking thru when I stopped to look at the menu. The owner welcomed me before I could even read it so I went in and it's such a cool little building. All the staff were excellent. Great burger and generous amount of fries and beers were fantastic too.","517":"Absolutely wonderful establishment. Fantastic ambiance, cool decor, great service. Shannon was absolute joy behind the bar and she is doing some amazing things with the cocktails on the menu here. Very helpful advice for a fellow bartender as well :). The house made syrups and infusions make a huge difference in the quality... so delicious! Loved the beers brewed in house. Definitely a place you need to check out if you are in Santa Barbara!","518":"Ordered takeout from here last week after passing by and reading the rave reviews. I love Indian food, I eat it several times a month, and I was hopeful to have found a new go to takeout spot. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. \n\nThe first giveaway that this may not meet expectations was that my food was ready in 5 minutes. 5!!! This restaurant does not have a buffet so it's not like they're constantly making fresh batches of popular staples. I was weary but hopeful to have my mind blown. \n\nThen, most importantly, the taste: bland, watery, clearly frozen vegetables with that sad frozen vegetable taste. This was the most tasteless Indian food I'd had in a while. I've attempted to make Indian vegetable dishes a couple times- it's turned out ok but not great - this was worse than that. The seasoning was SO off. I'm hoping it was an off night that's s not reflective of their quality and service but after throwing out almost all of a $14 dish, I'm not willing to try this place again any time soon.","519":"Went in for skinny iced mocha and it was the best one I've had!  Perfect blend.  Started to skip by here and head to Starbucks but really glad I didn't!","520":"Great service, not super formal. Crowded restaurant in a good way. Wish they could spruce it up a bit, paint the walls, get new chairs, etc... but felt cozy overall. The food I feel like is  good quality but nothing we had stood out in particular...\n\nWell, actually the bread that came at the beginning of the meal was great, with oil and Parmesan cheese\n\nAnd the caramel cheesecake was pretty good too! \n\nWill go back to check out the other items on their menu","521":"After hearing about this place a few times, I decided to give it a try today with my wife, mother-in-law and three kids. Simply put...it is a rough experience! Here are a few of the drawbacks:\n\n1. $4 parking (0-60min)- No validation\n2. Dining area had too much furniture and was not clean.\n3. The shelves with drinks, chips, etc. looked like they were having a close out sale. Empty.\n4. Rude employees...\n5. Trash cans were overflowing and they didn't even have openings big enough to accommodate the containers the food was served in.\n6. If one of your family members order a salad, and the other a sandwich, you can't pay for them together. It's weird.\n\nThe food was decent once we got it but honestly, not all that great considering the hassle you have to go through to get it and eat. There are a million great places to eat in Nashville...I'd put this low on the list.","522":"Great atmosphere, great service. Reason we came in was because of the host. This guy is a bishop. Get the assess in this Castle and have yourselves some wants. We had corn off that Cobb!!","523":"This place has some great drinks for a decent price. Outside of the Funk Zone, I can count on one hand the places that serve REALLY good cocktails, and this place is one of them.\n\nThey've got a cool, easygoing vibe inside and they've also got some great happy hour specials. \n\nThe bartenders are obviously really knowledgable about the drinks that they serve. The person I went with and myself had a great conversation with one of the bartenders about the whiskey they chose to serve, and it was clear they knew a lot about choosing drinks. (They even ended up pouring us a shot to taste!)\n\nThere's plenty of seating and this is a great, nice place to hang out with friends.","524":"3rd time coming here in the last 3 weeks and it has not disappointed! Safe to say this is our new favorite spot! From the crafty drinks to the tasty dishes, this is a go-to to anyone looking for a fun vibe and great service!","525":"The fried chicken is awesome! I tried both the Katsu sliders and the chicken tenders. Seasoned very well and wasn't overload with batter. The fries were too salty though, they need to ease up on that. I also tried the smash burger which also was very tasty. Good sized patty. They have plenty of outdoor seating with heat lamps for those who prefer to be covid cautious. \n\nThere's also a cute doggie flight with bowls of water. Bonus points for furbabies.","526":"Everything about this location confused me at first. As an alum of the building across the street, I was perplexed at how such a massive building with so many parts would fit *right there*. Like, how would that work? As a result, I gave it some space for a while. Not that it did anything wrong. I just didn't understand the physics behind the construction. And then I ventured inside...\n\nI don't know how they did it... I don't know what kind of witchcraft was involved but the powers that be managed to create a space that's light, airy and much more massive than I would imagine from the outside. This isn't Caviar & Bananas' first time at the rodeo -- and it shows. This is the perfect Midtown breakfast\/lunch spot. With dedicated areas that fit whatever mood you're in, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. Want a gluten-free muffin? Do it. Need some frozen rose in your life? All the time! I mean, you can find that here. Feel like some bougie grocery shopping? Okay. Looking for some international candies? They have 'em. In the mood for a sandwich? They can do that.* Fancy a salad? Let's do that... and that's what I did. A very smiley and kind young woman walked me through the menu. She told me her favorite was the Baja, so I ordered that. I was planning on eating my salad there but she prepared it in a to go box. I don't know if that's standard (a set up like C&B seems that it should go hand in hand with cool plateware) but it happened. With the to go box in hand, I took the salad to go and made my way home.\n\nThe salad was delicious. The combo of romaine, cotija cheese, avocado, corn, tomato, cucumber, jicama, pickled onions, and pumpkin seeds was a nice, bright burst of health with every bite. I haven't had much jicama since leaving Miami so that was a nice plus and the pumpkin seeds added depth to what could have been a flat salad. I was particularly pleased with the sliced avocado on top of the salad because I love avocado and rarely get a full one in a salad. I asked for the chipotle lime vinaigrette 'on top' and the dressing came mixed into the salad so it was more of an element of the dish than a last minute addition. C&B is a pretty spot on fast casual ladies who lunch destination. If you would have mentioned the concept and location five years ago, I would have said you were crazy. After being there a couple of times, I don't know what took so long.\n\n*I was in the mood for a sandwich but it took a little while for the gentleman behind the bar to approach me and when he did, he was wiping his nose. With the superflu making the rounds, I declined.","527":"Us:  Is it ok if we sit here?\nThem: Do you se a reserved sign?\nUs: No\nThem:  I guess you can sit here.\n\nNot a be right with you.  Not how can help you.  Not even a Hi.  Been in food since I was 12.  We didn't bother staying.   \nThanks for saving us money.","528":"I love coming here and highly recommend! The food is always great along with the drinks, but the best part is the atmosphere! This place is great for a girls night out, a date, or family time! The staff is always super nice as well as the owner!","529":"I'm a fan of good beer and bikes so this place was a must go for me. My husband and I enjoyed watching sports and drinking the locally brewed beers.","530":"We had such an exceptionally great first experience at The Cruisery last night, and so much so that we are extending our visit from San Diego one more night so than we can return tonight for a FANTASTIC second dinner and enjoyment of the pleasing ambience and incredibly welcoming, warm and helpful and friendly staff. \nWe were warmly welcomed in by the wonderful owner Hakan Kocak and were attended to with utmost care by our outstanding server Tony who made sure we were happy from start to finish. At the end of our eve, Hakan came over to introduce himself and we had a really fun interaction about how much we loved this place and his extensive background in the food and beverage industry. The outreaching and desire to establish personal connection with guests is so rare these days and soooo much appreciated","531":"Visited earlier in the year. Taylor was awesome. Very attentive and was kind to recommend some of her favorite dishes.  Everything was delicious, especially the carnitas with the pickled onion! Yum!","532":"With no explanation at all, despite the fact we had 5:30 reservations, the restaurant was CLOSED. I received a call that morning, at 9:45am, but they didn't leave a voicemail. I called back, left a message noting I'd assumed they called to confirm.\n\nI called again last night, after showing up to a dark and locked, closed, restaurant. No answer, and as if 26 hours later, no return call.\n\nConsidering the reputation, I'm shocked and extremely disappointed in the events of last night. Luckily Fayette Street Grille was open, and was able to accommodate us.\n\nUPDATE: 2\/27, 10 days have passed and I STILL have no return call despite TWO voicemails. Very sad, and disappointed with this business. Having good food doesn't matter when your service is terrible.","533":"Food is TERRIBLE! Sent Asada fries back, just nasty. Flatbread pizza came out & was just as terrible! Cold chicken on top & no flavor.  Asked the waitress some questions about the beer and she stated she only works there once a week & didn't know much. I would put 0 stars for this review if possible! I paid for a pizza I did not eat & 2 beers my boyfriend and I did not drink.","534":"Very flavorful spices and chicken that melts in your mouth, a local go-to spot for excellent Indian cuisine. Would love to go again next time I am in the area!","535":"We didn't get to even try the food. The owner is very rude and condescending. We were a party of four who asked if we could be seated at one of two available tables of six (all tables of four taken) so we didn't have to wait. There were no other parties waiting to be seated. He refused to accommodate us. When we questioned his actions saying it made no sense to make us wait when there were no other people waiting, he basically told us he didn't care if we left. So we did! If he continues running his business like this he will have no more clients and no more business. Ended up getting amazing pizza across the street for much less money than what they charge here. Horrible attitude!!!! Learn to treat your customers politely.","536":"Great beer great drinks great food and great service! Hakan knows people and knows flavor! 5 Stars!","537":"I really like the service, and the atmosphere  here great and fresh food drinks are so good i got the\n whiskey  smash sooo good","538":"A go-to for appetizers & cocktails in Santa Barbara. Their happy hour goes until 7! I've had dinner here once, but will stick with their apps & cocktails for the most part. Really great environment and great service, always!","539":"I ordered dinner for our company to be delivered on July 19 2021, Via this companies on line website. They brought the food the same day I did the order which was 7\/14\/21.  Since it was an evening delivery and I was out of work the next day due to a medical emergency at home, the minute I found out I called and talk to the owner. I was immediately hit with what proof do you have etc. etc. etc. Mind you we have ordered before for the same type of delivery for events at work. Obviously, they have lost our business which is a building of 75 people and everyone they know.\nSo disappointing that the owner of a company would react this way to a good customer. Didn't even ask the name of the company!","540":"We stopped by for some quick food and drinks, but ended up staying longer because our bartender, Jasmine, was so amazing. She was clearly very experienced and a pleasure to interact with as well! We will definitely be coming back for more drinks from her!!","541":"Amazing food.  Amazing patio.  Amazing people!  Just a perfect spot to spend a bit of the afternoon enjoying great company, a couple cocktails, and some incredible food.  The owner is one of the most passionate restaurant owners I've met... and you can tell with the food, and the people.  \n\nTry the shrimp taco's... they're amazing!","542":"Very clean environment and friendly staff! Lots of seating options so wait time is very minimal! Delicious food","543":"ok this place is really weird the exterior is super pretty and it gives off rich person brunch vibes but it is essentially a cafeteria??? there is a salad bar, a deli area, a bakery, and then you can buy chips, drinks, etc at a cash register. i got the buffalo chicken salad--it was pretty mediocre. the lettuce and chicken was good but the dressing was super bland and there was way too much cabbage. this is a place to grab a salad or something on your way to your job, don't expect a brunch place or sit down restaraunt really--I thought it was just a cafeteria for Vanderbilt at first.\n\nFOOD: 3\/5\nSERVICE: 5\/5\nATMOSPHERE: 3\/5","544":"Creative cocktails, delicious food, and a good beer selection! What more could you want?! I came here on a Friday night with a friend and they were packed. Luckily we were able to find two seats right at the bar so we grabbed those. We were greeted by the friendly bartenders right away and given some menus. We both took awhile deciding what to order and ended up actually letting our bartender pick our drinks. \n\nWe both were so pleased by the drinks we got! They were so delicious! Not too sweet and not too strong which was perfect! I wish I could remember the names but I don't, so I'll have to go back and try them again. We also got the chicken wings as well which were incredible! That sauce they have on the wings is amazing!! It's like sweet but tangy and oh so good! The chicken was also perfectly cooked and delish! \n\nI'm excited to head back here again to try more food on the menu as everything looks so good! I heard they have a special late night drink menu that I can't wait to try too. Thanks for the amazing first experience The Cruisery, I will be back soon! :)","545":"The wife and I were walking  State street and shopping. Decided to grab some lunch. We saw this place and said, \"Let's give it a try!\"   Delicious!!!  The smash burger was so juicy and tasty. The 1000 island sauce dripping down my hand,  the pickled red onions were so tasty.  My wife had shrimp tacos.  Mmmmmmm the chipotle spicy sauce. Came with 3 mouth blasting tacos.  We washed it with a strawberry mule and a blonde beer    Wasn't disappointed. Will go back!!! Thank you Cruisery","546":"Worst coffee I've ever had for a price $2.50 higher than the almost adjacent Starbucks. A passable but overpriced omelet though.","547":"The tall blond server with crazy eyes was so rude to my friends and I. Firstly, we asked to go to the bathroom, and another worker let my boyfriend go in. Then, the blond server started to be very aggressive towards my friend and I, to the point that I thought she was going to hurt us. She said we weren't allowed to use the bathroom without being a customer, even though her coworker had let my boyfriend in. She then proceeded to try to remove him from the bathroom forcibly. I was shocked by her rudeness towards us that I had not said anything, but my friend was trying to explain to her that we would be gone soon. We also were all wearing masks during this. Then, my boyfriend came out and I told him what had happened. He went over to this short  chubby bald guy ( from other bad reviews I think he is the owner, Aron) who proceeded to yell at my boyfriend and defend the super rude blond server even though she was in the wrong. \n\nTHEY WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE AND RUDE. \nWe will never eat here and I do not recommend this at all. \nI've worked in service and never would I have been able to get away with being this rude to customers. I hope she gets fired.","548":"AMAZING service, drinks, and especially FOOD. We got the spicy fries, flatbreads, bbq salad & sliders... all were 10\/10. Definitely coming back here!","549":"Nice ambiance, although I will admit it's kind of weird with all the old school ski stuff hanging on the walls and from the rafters. The skee ball is unique. They took out some of the big screen TVs from when it was BrewCo.\nThe food was good, although I think it was a little bit expensive but oh well that's downtown Santa Barbara for you.\n\nBut the thing that bugged me the most no Jack Daniels. I wanted a Jack and Coke. Isn't that a pretty standard drink? But they didn't have Jack. At all. They had some other high-end bourbons, and that's great! I love high-end bourbons. I drink high end bourbons often. But I just wanted a simple Jack and Coke. They don't have it.\nI could be totally in the wrong and I will accept it if someone gives me negative feedback for saying this, how can any place say they actually have a bar, and not have Jack Daniels or Jim Beam to serve?\nAnd don't get me on the rum offerings.","550":"Such a great night! The hostess, Ella, was exceptional - super friendly and warm, followed by Hailey, our server, who went above and beyond for us. The food and drinks were incredible! Pulled pork, fillet tacos, Cobb salad plus cookie\/vanilla ice cream dessert - phenomenal! We will be back every time we visit Santa Barbara.","551":"We ended up here because it is across from our hotel (Holiday Inn Express) but we were glad we did. It's always busy and I see why: large menu, great drinks & friendly service. \n\nI couldn't decide on the menu because everything sounded great. The server helped me choose the wings and suggested I do half\/half when she saw how indecisive I was. He ordered their Nashville Chicken Sandwich and she suggested he get the sauce on the side because it was really spicy. \n\nIt turns out it wasn't spicy for us Mexicans so I smothered that all over my buffalo wings. Their sweet and spicy wings were so delicious! My husband loved their Lazy Luchador Mexican lager and I had their seltzer mojito which didn't have a lot of alcohol. \n\nA must when on State Street!","552":"let me start by saying this was around 1 pm not many people and the customer service was bad the lack of staff was horrible  didn't get my order taken after 25 min. after getting a hold of a waitress she was rude  \n\n\n\nwhen ordering the chicken wings the waitress said i can do 1\/2 and 1\/2 i ordered sweet and spicy with garlic  no garlic later she said i didn't  .... tortillas for tacos need two tortillas every mexican knows this !!! only one so when you bite it all falls apart ...the chicken tasted like fish  and i didn't even order fish ...","553":"Seemed like a good place to go, but off the bat was odd. There were two men up front. One sitting in the host station and the other standing in the doorway. When my wife and I approached the door expecting to be greeted they both just stared at us like \"what do you want?\" I had to literally ask \"can we come in\" and the man by the door barely moved out of the way. So ok hosts suck. Next up was the food and drink options which all look great (but one). The waitress swung by, eventually, and said hi and asked what we would like. We just sat down so didn't know what we wanted yet so she was to come back later. It was hardly busy for a Tuesday night but we had to flag her down after awhile as she hadn't come back. I doesn't really take more then 10 mins to read their menu. In general the best way to describe their waitresses is the \"lack of urgency to serve.\" They all seemed to have the same attitude as the hosts which is just wanting to hang out. At least the bartender takes pride in his drinks because they were good and is the only reason for at least the 3 stars. As for the food: chips were good and fresh, burger was ok and my steak and frites were terrible. The steak seemed to mush as I  cut the steak and it tasted like no one has ever ordered steak from their place before and was just rapid thawed from the freezer. It was not seasoned (salt please) and was supposed to come with a chimichurri \"sauce\" but was more like a dry garnish of parsley, garlic and pepper flakes. Decor is pretty cool and seating was nice with a center communal table which would be cool on a Friday night. Will give them another shot with the hope everyone in the building (but the bartender) were just off their game for the night.","554":"Such a cute place! Stopped in for their restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised! It is a small family owned establishment with really great italian food. My server, Amie, was the best! She is actually part of the family whom owns the restaurant! She was so nice and took the time to explain the menu thoroughly. 10\/10 would recommend this place. I had the summer bruschetta, which was so simple yet tasted so fresh and delicious! Then I had the pescatore pasta, and all of the seafood was amazing! The pasta is all homemade as well. Thank you, I will definitely be back!!","555":"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Edmonton.\n\nPros\nGreat quality fish\nFamily run\nLots of free parking\nReally  good food for the money\n\nCons\nOpen and closed odd hours\nYou have to rsvp because this place is very small","556":"I went in this past Saturday and had an amazing time. Savannah was great, she made sure I was always taken care of in a timely manner, and was very entertaining. The food was delicious and she recommended the flaming lips and I really enjoyed the drink. The atmosphere was great and Savannah would be somebody I recommend to dine in with. I really enjoyed my time at The Cruisery, as a whole was great and I recommend it to anyone in the area.","557":"This place is HORRIBLE. It is so sad how downhill they've gone. The food is not fresh at all, I have no idea how they can call themselves gourmet and the employees do not care that they are giving you a half filled sandwich with week old chicken salad. The kale salad could be sitting there for three days and they would still serve it. The breakfast wraps are served cold and with a microwaved egg. All of the ingredients in the salad bar are not fresh. I am scared to order any of the meat because it looks so suspicious. I don't know how they get away with serving the food that they do and it's unfortunate because the food used to be great, but now I always feel sick after eating here.","558":"Hands down the rudest host I've ever interacted with in Santa Barbara in 10 years. I will never, ever visit this place again or recommend anyone go here. The food, service, and atmosphere are mediocre at best. An insolent host is just over the top. There are dozens of better, friendlier options within two blocks of this disgrace of a place.","559":"Great ambience and value!  Alexa, our server, was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. The chicken street tacos were amazing. Looking forward to going back!!","560":"Beautiful space with great unique eats and coffee. Will definitely be back. The salad was fantastic. Beautiful, fresh coffee. Had a great chat with one of the staff members. Bravo.","561":"I had a pork chop with risotto on special that was truly to die for.  I'm only giving it four stars not five because it took a full two hours to get our dinner, but maybe that's the \"Italian way.\" Also the wait staff was not very attentive. Our table was constantly littered with our empty beer bottles and not being cleared, and they didn't come to check on us much.  Overall tho, everyone in my party just raved about their dinners!","562":"Came to eat here. Came with a stroller and the dude was an ass saying \"there's no space for you and your strollers,\" in a very rude tone. This was after we had already called and said it was okay. And there was plenty of room and our stroller wouldn't have been in the way of anything. For the way the dude treated us, if I could give it zero stars I would. Won't come here even without the kids.","563":"4 stars only because I was only buying coffee today, but I'm sure I would give 5 if my experience was broader. What a cool place! The coffee was excellent, service was excellent. They also have salads, sandwiches, sweet treats, beer, wine. I wish I would have found this gem earlier!!","564":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood, the vindaloos, kormas and tikka masalas are excellent, naan are big and fluffy, best of all they do not skimp on the rice unlike some other places where they expect 2 people to share 1 rice serving.","565":"We had a late lunch here on Veterans Day and it was fairly busy, didn't look too crowded so we decided to stay and dined inside. The entire experience was atrocious. For starters, there was only TWO girls running the ENTIRE PLACE, inside and patio! No bartender, no food runners, no bussers, just them two. I can't even believe a manager would schedule SO poorly on a HOLIDAY! My fianc\u00e9 never got his beer he ordered so we cancelled it after 25 minutes, we were missing 2 items from our food order, our food was brought out with no utensils or napkins and the lettuce in my salad was brown. Needless to say, I asked for it to be taken off our bill and as we were closing out I had to let our server know how unpleasant our experience was. She of course apologized but we let her know, it's extremely unfair management but her and the other worker in this predicament. Yes it was a Wednesday, I'm sure it's normally slow, but come on, on a holiday in a busy town like ours...Terrible scheduling. Besides the service, the food was sup-par.","566":"I was surprised how all the new buildings popped up so fast. The newly decor had me giddy from the get start. I was wasn't sure where to start. I just stopped in to kill some time while waiting for our table next door at Nada. \nDefinitely a cool spot for a meet up or luncheons. \nI couldn't stop thinking that I needed to try something. So, I decided to come back the next day to try a few of their pastries and ice coffee. \nLarge Ice caramel latte gave me that booster kick. Had me wanting to run a marathon. \nTalking about a large chocolate chip cookie. This place sells a cookie larger then your average cookie. Strawberry cinnamon roll was a disappointment it was very dry and crumbled. Coconut macaroon was toasty good and rich. \nDon't forget parking garage 1 hour Free! Get your ticket validated.","567":"Thats a regular place, nothing special or to be exited of. Just a normal quality food, some kind of beers. Inside interior is cool. Also, you have an opportunity to eat inside which is pretty rare nowadays.","568":"Came here on a Thursday night with some friends. The night was slow so service was super on it and quick. Staff was very friendly. We ordered drinks: SB Sour, Pineapple Express, and Room for Activities. The drinks were all good, Room for activities was pretty watered down but still tasted pretty good. \n\nThey start you off with some seasoned pretzels and some water, I enjoyed this nice gesture. We ordered the wild wings \"sweet and spicy\" ones and some fries. Everything tasted great! Wasn't too much of a fan of the sauce with the fries but alone they were great. Overall had a good time here :)","569":"Visited tonight for the first time and was very disappointed.  First I'll start with the pros that got it 2 stars. Service was great!! Lovely staff and  very on top of customer care. That's about where it ends. My husband glass was dirty with food stuck to the I side. My fork also dirty.  Fruit flies swarming us (inside at night...so weird??). Food was VERY very ugh. We had two apps and a pizza that my hubs couldn't even eat. Just very low quality food. Oh yes yes...and my 13.00 glass of wine was literally 1\/16th full. I think I let out a little giggle when she dropped it off at the table.  Now, to be fair...we neglected to mention any of the above to the management while we were dining.  I mean...it was what it was. If you want a good beer and nothing else this place could work for you but I don't think we will be giving it a second chance anytime soon.","570":"Great place with great cocktails. Food is reasonable and the atmosphere is the best of State St.","571":"Ordered the steak salad and my daughter had the shrimp tacos. Salad was plentiful and filing but the tacos were tiny and more for an appetizer portion. Single layer tortillas fell apart but the taste was delicious. Salad was good but definitely order the dressing on the side. My lettuce was swimming. Overall good. Inside has some cute character.","572":"I think this may be the first Yelp review I've ever written but it needs to be said.  Went at 6:10 tonight and walking up to the door, it looked like it was closed.  Every chair in the building was already upside down on the tables and it was empty, but the sign on the door said open until 7pm on Sundays so we tried the door.  It was unlocked so we went in.  I ordered a salad and my wife ordered a wrap.  We went to get drinks and the only three LaCroix cans on the shelf were all dented and should be thrown out.  The restaurant was too dirty to eat there so we left to take it home.  We checked out for $28 for a wrap and a salad and then were hit with a $4 parking charge to get out of the garage after 15 minutes.  We tried this before they closed the first time and we've tried it again after it re-opened and we just don't see how they will stay open for long.  A place like this needs it's own parking lot to pick up carry out food and it needs to give the appearance it's open until it's time to close.  A good model would be Eatzi's in Dallas.  We wanted to give this a second shot but there won't be a third try. Very disappointing and over-priced.","573":"I am so happy Santa Barbara Brewing company closed that was here before. The service was so horrible when it was SB  and I asked to speak to owner of SB Brewing company but the servers would lie and say they can't let me contact owner. Anyway just glad SB is closed, some bad stuff went down then. The Cruisery has changed this place and made it amazingly good.","574":"Drinking from their cocktail glass was like drinking from something that belonged in Barbies dream house, tiny little glass, the price however was huge. Food portions were also ridiculously small. Service was 2\/10. Disappointing, would not revisit","575":"Really great place to have drinks! Have both cocktails and beer available! Food is also very good and staff has always been great","576":"Was good, a little hyped up though. I got avocado toast that I probably could've made at home. The muffin and biscuit were INCREDIBLE though. coffee was great, thanks to frothy monkey. Would go back, but have had better.","577":"New place to tempt you pallet with delight from the middle of the word!. Curry dishes to sooth the mouth with herbs and spicies!. People seem friendly and comfortable. For eat in or take out a pleasant eatery to relax the day away!. In my view Indian Cuisine, attempting arengment of traditions and culture all wrap up in one?.","578":"The staff is rude and condescending. I've never felt more discriminated against than I did when I was here. I used to come often but not anymore. They should really learn how to treat customers better.","579":"Came here recently and LOVED the food. Best I've had in philly so far. Service was attentive and speedy as well. Highly recommend the coconut chicken curry","580":"Fantastic place with great beer and some of the best sandwiches in town. We had the ah\u00ed tina sandwich, which was phenomenally flavorful and delicious. The grilled chicken sandwich is also very good. We had a couple of the lighter blond beers, which were very tasty and well-spiced. The decor is fun and on-theme, with cruiser bikes hanging from the roof and walls and even built into some of the tables. Great service. Will definitely be returning!","581":"Hakan the boiiiii. Amazing food and amazing brews. Yum yum yum\nHehehe\nMac n cheese w crumbs\nHazy ex gf is \nFlatbread is a nut. \nGo here for a good time :D","582":"Our kids took us here for our anniversary dinner.  The 6 of us shared apps(garlic clams were fantastic) and we all got different entrees and loved each one.  Service was friendly and not rushed at all.  I loved it so much I came back with some friends for restaurant week in Conshy. Family owned so give them a try!","583":"The worst alfredo sauce I have ever had. The sauce was bland and tasted spoiled. Will not be back","584":"After two experiences there can overall say it was fantastic! Attentive wait staff and even better food. Generous portions and absolutely will be a good to moving forward","585":"Good happy hour.  Full pints for $5 but only one offering.   And reasonable small plates.  \n\nThe Brussels sprouts were best happy hour appetizer.  \n\nIn general a nice place to have an outdoor beer but I wasn't blown away by food or prices.  \n\nPro tip is there is a great cigar shop 1 block away to get a cigar and smoke before or after your visit.","586":"We came for the frozen ros\u00e9 and it was okay but not really worth the stop. We picked up a prepared hot chicken salad to take with us and it was subpar. Overall if you don't stop by you didn't miss much.","587":"My rating does not reflect the service, only the food. The waitress was friendly and attentive. What I was very unsatisfied and disappointed with was the food. I ordered tacos and it would have been nice if they were listed as a starter or an appetizer, not to mislead people in thinking it's a regular size plate. It would have even been nice if the waitress would have warned me that the tacos I ordered were 3 tiny baby tacos about 2.5 inches in diameter, that all 3 were equivalent to one regular size taco. 1 regular size taco for $14 is not cool at all. And sadly they weren't even good tasting tacos.","588":"If you are a food blogger, Instagram queen (or king) or an aficionado of all things trendy and cool then C&B is your spot. C&B is a specialty market and cafe which started in Charleston, SC and I've not seen anything like it in my time in Nashville. The interior is immaculate from their perfect displays of pastries and sweets to pre-made salads and wines. Whether you are there to shop, eat or drink you will be impressed by the novelty of everything in C&B. \n\nThe place--\nIt took me a few seconds to orient myself settling my eyes upon the different stations available to order food. Did I want a salad, a sandwich or to grab something to go? It was a bit much to take in at first then I appreciated all the choices. When I was waiting for my order I was thoroughly entertained. Although I got my order to-go since I work nearby I would think it would be fun to dine in as well. \n\nThe food--\nI ordered the Tennessee Trio sandwich ($10.50) which had porchetta, pork belly and bacon jam along with cheddar, pickled sunchokes and arugula on a ciabatta roll. The flavor was all there and it was a very filling sandwich. The porchetta was a bit too crispy for me and the sandwich was a little too rich for me to order it again but I did like it. I got a bag of Zapp's New Orleans Kettle Style voodoo chips ($1.95) and a small blueberry hibiscus iced tea ($2.60) to go with my sandwich and my total was $16.44 which is a bit steeper than I want to pay for a sandwich, drink and chips but for a splurge every now and again I suppose it's okay. The iced tea is not sweetened at all in spite of the blueberry I picture being slightly sweet naturally, this was not at all. If you want a little sweet I would suggest putting some sugar in before sitting down. \n\nThe service--\nMy drink and sandwich took only a little bit to order. It can be a bit off-putting to have to go to two different counters to order but it didn't take much time. The front register for the barista will check you out if you get anything from one of the back counters. \n\nOverall, this is a place I'd meet a friend or perhaps treat myself for a nice lunch. Otherwise this is a bit too trendy\/pricey for every day dining.","589":"So we decided to go to the Cruisery because no other restaurants were open around 9:45 PM. My wife who got off work did not want to drive far and find something on the way home ended up here. We were both starving and ordered a lot of food considering they looked like tiny appetizers. Looking on yelp the tacos were bite-size that came in threes for one per order which cost about $14 for the fried fish taco and $16 for the steak tacos. Which is highly overpriced for tacos that did not come with anything else. We also got the wings which was $15 for 8 pieces that had nothing particularly special about them. The Juan's ceviche trio, comes with salmon, tuna, and shrimp. The salmon ceviche for me was too sweet for me because of the pineapples, the tuna ceviche was the best out of the three at least for me, the shrimp was so tiny and not enough(either put bigger shrimps or more small shrimps). When my wife brought the food home it came in so many bags, they literally wasted big containers for the tiny 2 bite tacos (one bite if you have a big mouth). One order of tacos came in a huge container, they could have put two orders of tacos in one container vs one container each per taco order. In my photo I combined the 2 taco orders of fried fish and steak into one container each. These tacos were one bite tacos for me...so $5 a bite. The fried fish taco was very chewy, hard and dry(I thought it was fried chicken). It was one of the worst fried fish tacos I've ever had. The steak taco was a little bit better but it had a lot of rosemary that kind of killed any other flavors. The guacamole was just smashed avocados with a lot of salt. I will say the fresh tortilla chips was actually the best. I most likely won't be coming here ever again for the food. I also told my wife to use the Axxess deal but apparently she told me that they don't take it but on the Axxess app it clearly says buy two entr\u00e9es and get a pint of beer for free. Maybe if I just want to drink and have overpriced tacos as a snack I may come back. My wife sent me the photo of the receipt and was surprised by the entertainment district fee, they basically charge you 4.7% that's not part of your tip so just want to throw that out.","590":"I have been coming into The Cruisery and Unbearable for about a year now. The Bartender Tommy has always been a joy to be around along with quick service and a good conversation. Justin has also been a pleasure to be around. Amazing drinks, beers, and food in a great location.","591":"Brought my dog Smokey to the Cruisery for the first time and was so happy to see how dog friendly this restaurant is. The food, drinks, staff and service are all great. Hakan, the owner was also extremely kind and ensured everyone was having a good time. Definitely a spot to check out when in Santa Barbara!","592":"I am absolutely in love with this place. The humor definitely shows from their soup of the day being margarita and their menus having subtle jokes. I recommend trying their indoor and outdoor seating as both places give an enjoyable experience. When seating indoor, you get to see the bikes hanging off the ceilings as for outdoors, you get that fresh breeze while also seeing what's happening around you. The servers are also very kind and offer food recommendations that are delicious. \n\nFor this place, I think their appetizers are better than their sandwiches and salads. The chicken flatbread and the elote are the best things on the menu as I've been here three times ordering something different each time. Their cocktails also have interesting and fruity drinks for the summer, so I recommend trying them.","593":"Stayed in Santa Barbara for 3 days and had to come here all three days! Great atmosphere, super friendly, dog friendly, great service, great drinks and apps. We tried the lavender lemonade and it was amazing as well as the plan-c. Crack fries and sourdough apps are a great snack to munch. Must try. The owner is great and welcoming, our server garret was the best, didnt catch the hostess name but she was also friendly and greeted us every time we passed by!  (Ps flaming lips drink lives up to the name so if you can't handle the heat stick with something else,\nIf you can it's yumm!)","594":"This restaurant was only opened for takeout only, and sometimes that's the way to go! With an immense sushi craving, I really wanted to like this place more. I read reviews of how the sushi was good quality, and I definitely feel like that was somewhat true! There was no fishy taste with the sushi. With the Chirashi ($19), the salmon pieces were lean, and there was one of each of octopus and surf clam. There was a fresh piece of lettuce and cucumber slices as well. The rice was nicely marinated and there were tiny fish roe scattered all over. Quite a generous amount compared to most places. I think I would have been happier with the salmon chirashi or maybe some maki instead. Better luck next time!","595":"I was visiting Santa Barbara this weekend and stumbled upon The Cruisery while walking State Street. If your in the area, this place is an absolute must! Im vegan so my options are typically limited, but not here! \nMy server Courtney knew the menu inside and out and answered all of my (many) questions to help direct me and my boyfriend  to the best dishes & drinks for our picky palettes. I had the veggie flatbread, and a drink called the flaming lips. He had the a impossible burger and a local IPA that Courtney suggested. Everything came out quickly, and tasted as great as it looked!! Seriously delicious food and amazing service. I wish I lived in the area so I could come back to try everything! 10\/10!","596":"We came from out of town (an hour away) and purposely chose to go to Cruisery first because pre-Covid we have a great experience overall. We had a group of 7, three of us were there to check in. We were told that six is max per table. Ok, fine, rules are rules. Then we said we could just sit at different tables, no big deal, we were fine splitting up. The very rude person helping us said \"nope, I'm not babysitting you guys not going back and forth\". While we were waiting for our table, even after the rude comment and half of our group going elsewhere, I asked to use the bathroom after the drive. I was told nope, not until I got my table. We immediately left. So unnecessarily rude. Lost 7 Thirsty and hungry people's business, then and from now on. I would not recommend. Three different documents attached.","597":"Just had the most amazing dinner at the cruisery with delicious drinks!! The owner was so sweet, he came to our table and introduced himself and turns out we both share the same hometown in Turkey!","598":"The was my first time at The Cruisery and it exceeded my expectations! It was my birthday and was given a shot on the house! We only came for cocktails and I got the Room For Activities, which was so yummy! My mom got the Plan C and it was also very flavorful! They also are dog friendly, even inside, and have a dog menu! My dog enjoyed the Good Girl (scarfed it down!). The owner (Hakan) and staff are very friendly which made the atmosphere even more comfortable and inviting. I will definitely be back :)","599":"Not good, not good at all. Got here for a late night snack and ordered the nachos, carne Asada fries and the wings. The nachos looked like they were microwaved on a paper plate... no blacks beans just black bean juice out the can AND they forgot guacamole. We told our waitress and she just looked at us and asked us what we wanted to do about it???? Literally anything at all please??? The carne asada fries were good but why were the fries so small? Made it so hard to eat. My friend ordered a drink and it never came... food was overpriced, underwhelming, and a pretty terrible experience. The older long haired guy who sat us seemed like a guest and it made me super confused, and kinda creeped me out tbh","600":"Great Sunday take out food, on time, flavorful and Open till late! Nothing more you can ask for","601":"Waited for this place to open for lunch and so glad we did! The owner and girls working were super friendly, always asked if we were satisfied, and the best part - let my sometimes unfriendly dog inside! They have a dog menu and honestly have not seen that anywhere else in Santa Barbara! My furbaby loved his meal and we loved ours! Great location on State Street, good music, the elote appetizer & spicy Bloody Mary was a great start to the weekend!","602":"Yum! What a cool spot. They have a pretty eclectic menu but they also have the skill to back it up. We came here during COVID times and all they had available was outside seating as well as take out\/pick up\/delivery.  However, coming in from out of town we were happy that somewhere was open to sit outside to eat as well as they had an actual happy hour! \n\nWe came in before dinner time so we actually had a tough time picking what we wanted from the menu because so many things sounded good. We ended up picking a handful of items but two of our favorites were the Ahi tostadas as well as the brussel sprouts. The Ahi tostadas actually had a fair amount of fish to everything else which was a nice change up from most places. And the brussel sprouts were so jam packed with flavor and heat! They were quite spicy but you couldn't stop eating them. \n\nFinally, we really felt this captured the SB spirit because it was filled with different types of people, college kids were our servers, and everyone was super kind and down to earth.","603":"This food was some of the best Indian food I've had in Philadelphia. It was all fresh, the mango lassi tasted fresh, and the chicken vindaloo and chicken tiki masala were amazing. We barely left any leftovers, it was so good. Service was excellent and attentive. I hope to come back soon to this gem.","604":"What a gem of a find. My wife and I came up for a friends b day and we got into town early so we decided to get lunch and the 1st place we ran into was The Cruisery and thank god we did. This Beer brewer with an amazing food program hit the spot. From the baked Brie to the shrimp po boy the food was presented great and tasted just as good. Now the beers I loved especially since they are the oldest brewer in the area the decor feels warm and inviting and between the two beers I had their IPA and Hazy I think I found my new go to beers. The owner Hakan was so nice and was engaged and proud of his place and rightfully so. I can't Wait to come back and do a full beer Review with the rest of \"The beer dads show\" crew.","605":"We dropped my sister off for college and we were looking for a yummy and healthy meal & good beer. The Cruisery was THE SPOT. The employees were kind, the service was good and we went back twice during our stay. 100% recommended","606":"wonderful service great food and awesome Covid protocols.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nI really liked chatting with our server and Aaron the owner.","607":"I rarely write reviews, I know how much they can affect a business. This past weekend we were in Santa Barbara on a mom\/daughter 8th grade graduation celebration, in lieu of a big school trip. It has been a hard year for kids, and we were super excited for an SB consolation prize. I went to college and lived in SB and know it well. We came to The Cruisery, which I have known for many years as SB Brew Co, a jolly place in which I've happily consumed many pints and apps and watched euro football with my family.\nThe food was great. Our problem comes with the grizzled angry man who says he is the owner. While we paid (no small amount of money), the girls ran across to the cookie shop to grab cookies to take back with us. I opened the box to look inside and a crazy rude man rushed over and said, you can't eat food from outside. Cool - no problem, we were leaving and had no need to sit there longer. But then he said it again, and not kindly, as if 3 grown, over-educated women and 3 intelligent, English speaking teenagers needed to be told (not asked) this very simple thing again. Pretty annoyed at the mansplaining, I said that we had heard him and got up to leave. THEN my daughter told me that said rude man had stopped one of our girls on her way to the bathroom, told her that she wasn't allowed to use the bathroom, and argued with her when she said she was sitting with this big group outside, and that he made her feel bad. Gave a 14 year old grief! Oh, small man.  Is disrespect necessary toward youth from grown ups (ever?), especially in a business that thrives on reputation and service? I think not. I went to ask him, and though I am writing from the \"hindsight\" annoyance, I did not begin angrily. I simply inquired as to why he would behave so rudely to us, and especially our gal who needed the restroom. You might think, ah, he apologized then, of course. Warmly, I'm very sorry for my tone, I didn't mean to be rude. I've had a long day (or a very long year. Haven't we all!). Here, can I offer you a discount for a future visit? I really hope you enjoyed your dinner and evening. We really appreciate your business . Nope. He dug in. Started arguing and justifying. Just kept arguing at which point I asked, incredulously, if he was the owner, because what professional service industry employee would ever behave this way and expect to keep a job? He said he was indeed the owner. And if he's had a bad day or year, I'm guessing many more are coming, cause that dude is in the wrong business.\nIf I could give it zero stars I would, except for the Flaming Lips, which were outstanding. Not recommended due to ungracious and entitled owner, or whoever he is.","608":"WOW!\nWe just happened upon them and noticed they brewed their own beer. I had What the F**k and my husband had the Hazy Ex Girlfriend both were very tasty. We also got the sweet Thai chili wings - yummy!\nThe staff are very friendly.","609":"Dogs are welcome AND encouraged to join us! The staff are incredibly kind to us AND our dogs! The beer is delicious and the food tops off the experience!","610":"Great service and drinks! Super fun! Has sports games playing on tv!! We love the cruisery!","611":"My dad had a really bad experience with the attitude of those who worked here, but with us visiting and looking for food he decided to try again. Our family comes up and they start saying that they can't combine tables for six- but will make an exception. Later, my mom and brother show up with boba and the manager- immediately starts being rude to my brother (16) who was not being rude and asked why the drinks were not allowed. No problem that they didn't allow outside drinks- i worked in a restaurant and understand. But the manager starts calling him \"bud\" and saying \"i'm working with you so you need to work with me bud\". When my brother wasn't being rude or giving sass, and felt so humiliated for no reason. Didn't end up sitting there or trying the food, super upsetting especially when we didn't do anything to upset them? I understand it can be frustrating to move stuff around but my family was more then nice and did nothing to deserve the rude attitude of the manager- especially my brother. Will not be supporting this business.","612":"Rude service from bald door dude. I was asked what I was going to order before I used restroom. I'll take my grown ass money elsewhere. Bye assholes!","613":"Finally made it here and yes I agree with what I have been hearing, fun, casual, relaxing atmosphere, with great service, food, and beer. Our wait person was excellent, made sure we were happy with everything and exchanged an item for us we did not care for with a smile. I love the casual sturdy furniture and bicycle accessories. They have beds available for dogs, gotta love the place for that alone. Recommend their buffalo wings and flatbread. We will be back with friends.","614":"Loved, loved, loved this place!! We only popped in for a quick drink, one in particular, but I have to say, this place was really cool, the bartenders were amazing, ambience was chill. \n\nSo, the drink my friends brought me there for was the vanilla tobacco smoked bourbon. Honestly, the best bourbon I have had in forever. The bartender literally puts a small pile of vanilla tobacco on the bar, lights I in on fire and when it begins to smoke, they place the glass over it for a little bit to get that smokey vanilla flavor in the glass, then one big ice cube with the bourbon poured over the top. Amazing to watch and even better to taste! If you like bourbon you will love this drink! \n\nOh, btw, it's called the Fig & Haley, ask for it the next time you're here!","615":"We visited SB from down south with our new puppy and came across this amazing place. Hakan told us that they love dogs, so we immediately said yes and decided to dine here. The staff was super friendly and the food was amazing. Definitely recommend if you have a dog with you. They also have activities next door which Hakan gave us tokens too. 10\/10 would recommend if you're visiting SB.","616":"Based on the outside I thought this place was going to be a greasy spoon, but when I went inside I was wrong. This restaurant is tiny but the inside is very modern, nicely decorated, well lit and the space is utilized well enough to still provide privacy for diners. The customer service is good and so was the food. Sushi Wasabi isn't that bad but it wouldn't be my first pick for Japanese food. If I happened to be in the neighborhood and was hungry, I would dine here because it does have reasonable prices.","617":"What a cool place! The ambiance was great, they allow DOGS, which is a huge plus for dog owners and those of us who love to gawk at others' dogs. Hakan, the owner, is so personable and he recommended the AHI TOSTADAS for my pescatarian diet. Oh. MY. Gawd! Fantastically delicious! What a Santa Barbara gem.","618":"Our hostess Dani was awesome! It was our first time there and asked her what she recommended. She broke down the whole menu and gave us some amazing recommendations that we took and we were so satisfied. Thanks Dani!","619":"Cute little spot, the hostess was super sweet and helpful to accommodate a group of 6 last minute for a group of 6 with a dog! You can order cards against humanity and we played while eating. Super dog friendly indoors and out. Easy access to parking. And the food was great!","620":"Danni the hostess was awesome! So sweet and helpful ! Food amazing as well ! The servers were great as well !","621":"Fun place, amazing food, awesome sangria, friendly service.  Definitely will be back if we are back in town.","622":"Another great review for our beloved Cruisery. Our waitress Jocelyn was lovely!! \n\nCruisery, we need some sort of loyalty program!! This was at least our 10th time, and we'll be back 10 more!! \n\nFlaming Lips and The Floor is Guava for the win!!!","623":"Very upset . I place my order for churros and never came out . I waited almost 30 mins and nothing . Leanne should been checking up on it knowing it was taken long. They didn't even bother caring if I even got my dessert after my dinner . If u want people back maybe u guys should've tried harder","624":"Great food, amazing drinks, personable owners, and perfect service. Also cute dogs! What more could you ask for?","625":"We stopped in on a whim and so glad we did! We had nachos and burgers and both were great!  The fries are California fries and delicious as well. Top notch service and the owner as pictured here was so accommodating and fun!  Choose Happy!  Or was that Hoppy?","626":"This restaurant was so accommodating to our large group with dogs! We had fun tasting drinks, eating, laughing and sharing dog stories with acquaintances! Many thanks to the manager who was so friendly and inviting!","627":"Santa barbara had a limited amount of places open late for food. We've wanted to try this place for a while and would only recommend it for drinks and late night snacks. Spent $200 on food for wife and me + one pint + 20% tip on togo order and was barely full with no left overs. Wife had Juan ceviche trio, wings, guacamole, and tacos. I had tacos and the Nashville chicken. The tacos were tiny for the price. I thought they should have at least thrown in beans or rice or something to make the tacos feel like it's worth the price. Elsewhere, these tacos would have been less than $6.  The Nashville chicken was two flavorful chicken tenders.  I liked how they gave me lots of pickles, the sauce had a good heat level and it wasn't overly sweet like a lot of other places.  I don't like shoe string fries, so can't comment on them. The flavor of the steak tacos were not bad but just over priced, you can see the size comparison next to the lime. The fish taco was ok, not the best. It could have gotten soft on my car ride home, but flavor was OK. Wife gave me her salmon ceviche because she doesn't like fruits in hers, and some of the salmon pieces tasted fishy. The ceviche trio comes with a taster, but you can't take it to go, so I asked to have them while I waited for my order. They forgot, so I had to remind them at the bar.  The tasters are a pilsner (netflix &pils) and an IPA. Since I couldn't try it together, I would imagine the pilsner going well, but not sure about the IPA.  Sometimes IPA can taste bitter and ruin foods. I wouldn't mind ordering the Nashville chicken again and having a beer or two, but not the over priced tacos","628":"I visited the cafe portion of this place for a bit during late afternoon and enjoyed a coffee with their coffee cake and chocolate croissant. Got the coffee cake at the recommendation of the woman who served me and oh man was it a good decision. May have been even better if heated up.\n\nHad a nice time sitting at the high top seating by the window while I read and watched people stroll by with their dogs.\n\nSeems like there is also a market portion on the other side of the cafe and I read that they serve beer and wine too!","629":"Fun place with good drinks.   Dustin and Evan behind the bar were super friendly and made us feel welcomed.   We will be back next time we are in Santa Barbara.","630":"It was super busy in downtown Santa Barbara on this Saturday night, but fortunately, the cruisery was able to sit us right away without a reservation. The staff was super friendly and our server (Claudia) was very attentive and welcoming towards us. We first started off with a round of drinks and we ordered: Flaming Lips, The Floor is Guava (which was pretty strong), Lavender Lemonade, & Forgeat My Manners (which is on the happy hour menu, but my friend has been here before and loves it). I personally liked the lavender lemonade the best because I don't like a strong alcohol taste, so it was perfect for me.\n\nAs for food, we ordered California Katsu sliders, Crispy Chicken sliders, Ahi Tuna club sandwich, and the Chicken Caprese flatbread. Of all of all the items we ordered, we all agreed that the chicken katsu sliders was the best tasting one (which was mine!!). The chicken katsu was very crispy and the sauce was super flavorful and I really enjoyed it as well. Unfortunately, the crispy chicken sliders were a bit dry, so my friends preferred the chicken katsu sliders instead. As for the ahi tuna sandwich, the fries were well-seasoned, but the ahi tuna was not flavored enough and tasted bland. 4 stars for my personal experience, but maybe 3 stars for my friends.","631":"Came across this place while walking downtown , when we walked up to the door we told the gentleman up at the front it was 3 of us and a baby . He said \"we are not kid friendly \" we all looked at each other and kinda laughed and though the guy was joking , but he said  he couldn't have us blocking the the a\u00edsle . Mind you my stroller is not big and we went around 2:30 pm . We were in disbelieve that a place downtown would not be kid friendly , and turn us away . Such a disappointment . Has anyone else been turned away , because you have a child and  therefore they can not accommodate you because of it ? Or was it just me ? The placed seemed very welcoming since thy had the doggy bowls that said doggie flights , I'm assuming they allow dogs ,but don't allow parents with a baby and a stroller .","632":"Great location, ate outside..chill vibe...that's the 3 stars. We both got the smash burgers...if you've ever had smash burgers, these are not! They were more like a just average burger, maybe even from frozen? Certainly not a $15 burger. Very disappointing","633":"This review is for the \"manager\" working on Halloween evening (I did not get his name but he said he was the manager when I asked to see the manager, he has long dark gray hair.). The food, beer and service from my waiter was great.   I really enjoyed my fish tacos and beer flight.  When I was finished eating I asked for the check and my waiter brought it over.  While I was enjoying my beer flight a friend called and we were chatting on the phone when a guy (not my waiter) brought over chips, salsa and guacamole and placed them on my table.  At first I thought it was a mistake, but when I turned around the guy was gone.  I continued to chat with my friend for another 10 minutes then hung up.  Looking at the chips in front of me I thought they were either comp'ed (I am a member of the Maltose Falcons Brew Club and that happens a lot at breweries, I was wearing our club shirt) or went with my fish tacos and my waiter just forgot to bring them originally, so I started to munch on the chips.  A few minutes later the guy grabs the chips and salsa from my table and tells me  \"if you want to keep eating them you need to pay for them!!!  These were for another table!\"   I just said OK take them.  A few minutes later my waiter comes over and apologies, I mention how rude the other guy acted and he admitted that it was rude and was sorry.  I paid my bill and left a great tip for my waiter.  But I was still feeling very upset about the treatment from the other guy that I decided to talk to the manager.  It turns out that the long haired guy was the manager!  I bought up to him how I felt about the interaction, he motions for us to go outside.  Then instead of apologizing, he insinuates that it was my fault that he left unordered food at my table by mistake because I was talking on the phone and that since I ate some chips I should of payed for it!  After further discussion he finally apologizes, but it was really just to get rid of me, not sincerely.  Owners, please train your managers so that this will not happen to other guest at your establishment.\n\nLooking thru pictures, it looks like the manager I talked with is actually the owner...  all i can say is wow, not the way to run a business!","634":"Came in today around lunchtime and was seated by the wonderful host Ali! Was so welcoming! Tried the \"soup of the day\" margarita and loved it. Will be coming back!","635":"My husband and I stumbled on this place while walking down state street. They weren't busy so we sat at the bar and had great conversation with the bartenders and even better drinks. We loved it so much we ended up going back a few nights later and enjoyed more great drinks and socializing. Amazing spot and awesome vibe!!","636":"Exceptional service and customer care from the owner. A true reflection of what SB has to offer. Food and drinks are fantastic. Happy people all about, clients and staff alike!","637":"What wonderful owner hosts! Ask if Hakan is in and experience Santa Barbara hospitality. Perfect options all day and night long. So glad to live in the neighborhood and enjoy the fabulous food and atmosphere.","638":"An impressive build-out and design, but the cappuccino was not memorable. I have not ordered food here other than the croissant, therefore this review is based on the coffee and service only.\n\nThe signature drink is a sesame latte, my wife ordered it and at first the flavor was strange. Adding sugar is necessary because the sesame flavor is bitter. We expected this drink to be unique, but would not order it again.\n\nWe also ordered an almond croissant that \"looked\" delicious, but was as hard as a brick and we had to throw it in the trash it made a loud thud noise. The barista was rude, I asked her if the baked goods were made in house, she smugly responded, \" I don't bake the items, but a baker does.\"\n\nThere are limited coffee options in this area of Nashville, especially by our hotel. Unfortunately, the only other option, Starbucks, is the better choice.","639":"I was invited to the soft opening before doors open to the public on Wednesday, 6\/21. Our table of four sampled a few of their brunch offerings. I had the breakfast burrito that was very tasty with pulled pork and a side of jalape\u00f1o grits while my friend ordered the same thing without pork. Everyone agrees that mine tastes better with the pork. My friends ordered the avocado on toast with shrimp and an egg and liked it but would have preferred a thicker cut of toast. We also tried the biscuit and waffles which was a huge portion. The piece of chicken was very large. The mimosas were delicious. We enjoyed our meals but since it's a market, they served everything on plastic plates as well as plastic cutlery. Service was on point they were friendly, helpful, and checked on us frequently. The space is great. You can pop in for a sandwich, dessert, or grab some packaged items to go. I think they will so very well in the space. Looking forward to going back and trying more items on the menu.","640":"We came with a party to have dinner and drinks, the hostess said one of our party needed to wear a mask to enter so he left to go buy one next door since he forgot his at home. We asked if the rest of us could be seated while we waited and immediately some man I assume to be the owner (bald) came up and refused to seat us saying they don't seat incomplete parties, which is fine but then went on to accuse that our friend was just going to come back and try and sneak in.... His attitude was so unnecessary and upsetting we immediately left to take our business elsewhere after our friend came back with his mask. If you want business you should treat customers with respect and not be condescending towards them when they did absolutely nothing wrong. Won't be coming back, plenty of other restaurants with kinder staff in Santa Barbara, I recommend you do the same!","641":"I stumbled upon this place while walking down the streets with a friend, and I'm super glad we did!!!\n\nThe vibe was great, had a good alcohol selection, and server Leanne was fantastic! She recommended the ahi tuna club for me, and the sweet grilled pineapple with the kick of siracha aoli added such a wonderful tasting palette.\n\nMy friend is vegan so her options are usually limited, but Leanne was so patient and friendly when recommending a menu for her as well. I can see why this place always looks so busy.\n\n5 stars for the food and the service!!!","642":"What a treat it is to be at The cruisery. Just had an amazing meal at the bar while watching the games. My wife is loving the cocktail list and the Bears are keeping me more than satisfied. jalape\u00f1o poppers on another level and the Black and blue salad is on point. Super stoked to be here and cannot wait to come back. Dustin behind the bar is the man, no joke, this man can make anything! Great experience all around.","643":"Went here last week and was very impressed! The server, Parker, was awesome and super helpful. He helped us select cocktails that paired perfectly with our meals. Will definitely come back again!","644":"we had ali as our server and she only came to our table once. i have never been ignored this much. i usually am so chill about it and i understand it's the weekend but she was so inattentive and absent the whole time we were there. this lovely girl asia helped us out at the bar at wine therapy\/unbearable afterwards and she was 10x more attentive which speaks volumes since she's at a bar. thank you asia for the great service!","645":"The perfect menu - something to EAT and DRINK for everyone. Love the service and the vibe, too. Very dog friendly! A new stop for us when visiting SB!!","646":"Probably the nastiest piece of pizza I ever ate.  Came half cold, cheese barely melted, and tasted like complete garbage.  Wouldn't be surprised if that same pizza had been sitting out on the counter all night and put back in the oven the next day.  Not to mention they decided to mop the place with some foul smelling chemicals right next to me as I sat there trying to stomach the gutter pizza that had been placed before me. At the end of the night I was proud of my body's ability to resist blowing chunks all over the place.  Otherwise known as horking the hot chowder.","647":"Waiting and waiting, told us the keg needed changing and have been waiting, mote just walk out.","648":"A MUST VISIT!!! We visited the Cruisery this weekend while on vacation and had an absolute blast!!! The atmosphere, bartenders, and drinks we're all 12\/10. We shared the pineapple express, whiskey smash, lavender lemonade with rum, and even a little bartender special whisky cocktail that blew us away! We had so many good laughs with the workers! This bar will always be a top memory when we look back on our trip. We will definitely be back","649":"Was visiting SB for the night and a waitress at our hotel recommended Cruisery! The owner (pictured) was super nice and friendly. I got the lavender lemonade to drink and it was soo yummy and refreshing! For dinner I got the \"not possible\" tacos. SOOOOO GOOD!! overall a good ambiance and trendy spot. We'll definitely be back when we visit again!","650":"This place was a hit or miss, depending on your order. The elote was an absolute hit; delicious, sweet grilled corn drizzled in lime aioli and queen fresco! So, so, so good. The impossible tacos were also pretty good! They were a bit dry, but the aioli they were served with made all the difference to make a great meal. And the servers were all super attentive and accommodating. \n\nNow onto the misses... the main one was the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Despite both of my friends' relatively high spice tolerance, both were barely able to eat the sandwich without the fiery burn lighting up their mouths. The spice levels throughout the meal, in fact, could be toned down a bit. The tacos, the elote, the sandwich... there was no respite from the heat. A bit of spice goes a long way, but an excess really just detracts from the meal itself. Also, it was getting pretty chilly outdoors as the sun went down, but after asking for the heaters to be turned on, none were. So all in all, I'd come back only for the iron pan of elote (which comes with some yummy chips and watery salsa) and maybe some drinks.","651":"I came to Santa Barbara for a beautiful day to see the sights and enjoy the funk zone, after some wine, it was time for food! This place is in the center of the action in the corner.\n\nWe weren't necessarily looking for the best of Santa Barbara food, but this place definitely hit the spot! We got the chips and guacamole to start along with a shared drink. Both were delicious and fresh!\n\nThe main courses were also delicious! We got the plant based tacos as well as the chicken katsu sliders. Both were well seasoned and definitely filled you up! Honestly, something I want to go back for again next time I'm out in the area!\n\nService was great! Sweet, friendly, and available for us! \n\nWith great service and food, I definitely will be back to this place for some good food and great times!","652":"THE best margaritas. THE best bartenders. THE best servers. THE best vibe. Cruise on over.","653":"This place is so cute! Dani was so well informed on the menu, she was super helpful and nice! Wings are fire, get the Thai flavor!!!","654":"Awesome experience. Drinks and food were fabulous. The wait staff is delightful and attentive.","655":"This review is mostly for the salad station. I eat here at least once per week. I really love the Asian salad. The employees that work at the salad station for lunch are always attentive, friendly, and happy to customize the salads (add avocado, dressing on the side, etc.). Overall, the store is beautiful and bright with a great atmosphere. 5 stars!","656":"Place was really nice. Staff was amazing. Bald headed guy with the barking dogs was a dick to everyone.  I'm assuming he's the owner. He walks around like he owns the place. Harasses his employees in front of guests and is disrespectful towards guests. We couldn't believe it. Drinks were great. Bartender and host were great. We will not come again because how we saw the owner treat his employees in front of us. Completely disrespectful. The guys must have personal issues","657":"2 years later made my way back here again. Still love the ambiance. It has changed slightly but definitely recognized the spot. \nOrdered the flight of beer which comes with 5 choices, so I picked\n1. 3 wheats to the wind - my fave\n2. Beach please\n3. Hazy ex-girlfriend\n4. Hoppy ass fuck\n5. Redhead redemption\nI was impressed by the amount of beer that came with the flight for the price. I couldn't finish it but to be honest, this wasn't my first drink of the night.\nVery much enjoy this spot","658":"Cold Santa Barbara night with warm Turkish hospitality. Hakan the owner made us feel special. Smash burger was great, service was excellent. We will be back for sure.","659":"Amazing food and amazing service! Claudia is the best so sweet and attentive! We got the elote corn, crack fries, guacamole, Pineapple Express. Also the steak flatbread and just about everything else on the Menu!","660":"Drinks are just ok and over priced. Beer is subpar compared to the rest of the amazing breweries in Santa Barbara and California. Owner (short, middle aged with shaved head, I Think was owner)  was short with us and rude when we asked a question. \n\nBad experience over all but I think it's because we are not college kids, which seemed to fill the bar. Which makes sense. \n\nWon't be back.","661":"I love coming here for their drinks and chicken wings. I usually get the sweet n spicy Thai chicken wings and their shoestring fries. They always have the best flavor and are meaty wings. Most of the drinks here are delicious and strong. I always feel my shoulders drop when I take a couple sips. I also got the asada fries this last time I went and it was good. It had beans, meat, cheese, onions and fries. The pulled pork bbq sliders with cheese were really good too. Tasty and filling!","662":"Great food, worst customer service. Very rude host, wasn't even busy but ignored half the people waiting","663":"I was there April 9 ,party of 8 and the manger was rude and couldn't seat us for 8  so the manger separated us (mind u it was my cousin bday we were celebrating. So upset because there was other people that had a party of 8 and more and he accommodated them inside the restaurant but I don't understand why he separated my family inside makes no sense .","664":"Excellent service despite the restrictions.  Another small business hit hard by closures which deserves a visit.  Good food and great drinks.","665":"Ordered the ahi club sandwich. Looked over the menu closely to make sure I knew what was on it, because I have allergies, specifically to avocado. Menu says there's no avocado on this sandwich, but my sandwich had sizable slices of avocado on it. I'm allergic so I couldn't eat it at all. I wouldn't have ordered this if it was described accurately on the menu.","666":"This is one of the reviews where I'll start out by saying that our experience was so bad that it reminded us that Yelp exists; one of those experiences where you're fueled with upset that something has to be done; one of those experiences where we would create a new Yelp account just to post a review, if we didn't already have one.\n\nI also want to start off by saying that I completely understand that during the loosened stage of the pandemic, as restaurants have been given the yellow light to operate, things are stressful. Rules need to be followed, they're strict, customers are rude, life is still a little shaky for everyone.\n\nThat said, it's important to understand our issue isn't the CONTENT of the owner's verbal message to us, but the DELIVERY.\n\nWe were sitting outside at a spot that had plenty more seats at our table. Our two friends showed up to join us, and because of the rules, were not allowed to join us. \n\nFine. We didn't know the rules, and we all appreciate the following of them.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe owner STORMED over to our table, and unprovoked, he started yelling at us that they couldn't sit with us, \"unless they're your roommates or family, and I already KNOW they're not!!!!\" And walked away spewing attitude at us.\n\nAgain, we (now) know the rules and don't have an issue with the nuances of operations during these current times. But he yelled at us, approached us in a physical manner only matching someone who would get violent, and made assumptions without asking or explaining.\n\nHe yelled, and stormed, and huffed and puffed.\n\nOur friends who weren't able to join us were also verbally assaulted at the front by him.\n\nLater, one of them said, \"well maybe he was just having a really bad day? I don't know but that was insane.\"\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nWe actually went to the Cruisery the day before and also had a very rude experience of the owner who wouldn't take the time and energy to explain to us why we had to sit in the back of the brewery when all tables in the front were open. He rudely slammed the menus down, and walked away with \"this is what you get.\"\n\nWe, too, thought maybe he was just having a bad day, and that's why we arrived there the next day - to give them a 2nd chance. I'm glad we did because now we know it's not just a bad day. It's TERRIBLE customer service.\n\nIn both instances, BOTH waitresses apologized for him and gave us the look and roundabout way of saying, \"I know. He's awful. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nI'm giving 1 star because yelp is making me. Despite their perfect set up on State St, the nice physical atmosphere, and the apologetic staff, we will NEVER eat here again and will let our friends know.\n\nWe immediately got our bill, and left our food and drinks uneaten. We walked by the owner and he said nothing.\n\nThere are so many more inviting restaurant owners in town who are doing everything they can to get back on their feet. They're deserving, they're patient, they're humbled, and most of all: they're grateful. Give your business to them; NOT to this place.\n\nIf you are unsure of my review, simply go there. He's the man in the front, doing the seating. Usually wears a baseball cap. Just pretend you don't know something, or simply ask a question about \"why\" something. I promise you, you will not walk away with the warm and fuzzies. That will just be a TASTE of what you'll experience if you keep engaging with him.\n\nAs patrons, it's often a lot of our first times out in public, and dining. We know there is rules, but we don't KNOW them. We were given training by the city, we're not on the mailing list for restaurant operators and given the policies.\n\nIT IS THE RESTAURANT's JOB TO NOT ONLY ENFORCE THE RULES, BUT TEACH THEM TO THEIR PATRONS. THIS GUY WOULDNT UNDERSTAND TEACHING OR LEADERSHIP IF IT SLAPPED HIM IN THE FACE.\n\nTo patrons: even if you plan to follow them and be gracious being enforced in them, if you don't know all the rules like the back of your hand, just know that the owner of this restaurant already hates you, does not respect you, and will have no problem letting you know. He is the worst reflection of the beautiful restaurant management this town strives to hold reputation for. Be warned.\n\nTo the owner: you don't belong in this city, taking precious business away from the deserving. You are UNKIND and if you're SO uncomfortable with the current situation in the world, fucking wait to open. The last thing any of us need is your toxic venom seeping in through the masks we are so delicately abiding by in wearing. Moving forward, do yourself a favor and stay out of your business. You're the kind of owner that belongs in the back. And if you don't, if you continue to verbally assault your customers with your vicious attitude, just know that when you eventually succumb to the demise of your restaurant it is NO one's fault but yours.","667":"My friends and I came here because we thought it was a super cute aesthetic and the food pics looked great on Yelp! After coming, we all thought the food was good but overall just pretty okay. \n\nMy flatbread was the tastiest thing we tried but it wasn't one of the best I have ever had. The french fries lacked seasoning and the salsa was superrr thin (like water). My friends had the nashville \"hot\" chicken sandwich, and they have no idea why there are quotes around hot. They said it was SUPER spicy, so if you like really spicy I would recommend it! \n\nOur server was nice, however it took them 4 asks to turn on the heater before they actually remembered.","668":"Went here for the first time and had an AMAZING experience\/service from Kayla. Went on a Tuesday and they had fast service. Great drinks and great  food! Hospitality was so great that I can't wait to come back.","669":"3.5\/5 Ambiance. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I sat outdoors and they were playing some nice jazz music to set the vibe! Our seat did have the AC dripping on the side but it wasn't too bad. You see the sunset and it gives kind of like a beach vibe, with this restaurant at the corner of a neighborhood.\n\n4.5\/5 Service. Our waitress was nice and knew the specials of the day really well. Everyone was so kind.\n\n4\/5 Food. The bread basket here is AMAZING! My friend and I ate 4 baskets and craved for more the next morning . The bread is lightly toasted and has soft, chewy insides. We had the lobster ravioli for appetizer, which tasted so good. It is creamy but the lobster stuffing inside has a kick of spiciness, which balances it really well. You get 3 raviolis, which was perfect for an appetizer. The portion sizes for the pastas are really big, and I was so full when it was time for the entree (probably because of all the bread...) But overall, everything tasted pretty good!","670":"Location is very private. The scenery is not the best If you're sitting outside. Lots of traffic and view is not pretty.\n\nReally pricey, especially in Conshohocken when there's other competing Italian restaurants. Definitely should have $$$ instead of $$. Entrees start at $25, but 95% of the entrees are within the $35+ range.\n\nWe got here at 7:00pm, and we didn't get our food until 7:45pm. It was an extremely long wait. The service is very  slow. \n\nNow that I got all the negatives out of the way, the food was incredibly delicious. They gave refills on bread and supplied extra Parmesan cheese on the side. We got the veal Vivian and the Rigatoni Agli Olio. There was no shortage of sausage within the rigatoni agli olio and my boyfriend raved about the veal vivian. \n\nI'd come back if I had time to spare, but nothing great comes fast or easy, and the food here is great!","671":"Terrible service, rude staff. The food was awful , I would not give them your business.","672":"Caviar & Bananas is a great place to grab a healthy breakfast and probably lunch. The inside is light and bright and there is an awesome patio outside overlooking 21st ave. I had the fried egg and prosciutto sandwich and fresh fruit. The sandwich was great but the cantaloupe in the fruit mix was quite hard. My husband got the BELT and parmesan potatoes. The sandwhich was also awesome but the potatoes were a little weird tasting. I didn't get a mimosa but the people around me who had one looks quite pleased. I will grab one next time around. \n\nThe parking in the attached garage is free for one hour with validated parking. This is a perk considering if you go to nada next door it's $3 an hour.","673":"First of all let me say that if there was a \"worthless\" rating, I would certainly give that to them - especially after reading all the reviews about Aron W. Ashland of Tucker Hospitality, Inc.\n\nCertainly looks like he trains all his employees to be rude, especially when his manager \"Dustin\" tells a customer to call the owner and expect to be treated worse - YES, he actually said that!!!\n\nThis only dish this place serves is RUDE and ROTTEN ATTITUDE(S).","674":"Hakan and his team run a top-notch spot here in beautiful Santa Barbara. The margaritas were amazing, the beers refreshing, and the food spectacular. Cheers!","675":"Chef Juan did an absolutely amazing job Recreating the menu with his toe curling good food !","676":"It was a foggy Monday.  We cruised into town and settled. In our humble abode.  Calling an Uber was a challenge.  It became later and later.  Finally solace as our 3rd driver actually showed up and deliveres us downtown.   Now starving, very hangry we eyeballs a glow from the corner shoppe.  It was the Cruisery.  A quick glance at the menu sealed the deal.  Once inside Sean came to our rescue.  Many fine craft cocktails and red beers to follow.. We enjoy our greens and ravished the beet and arugula salad followed by the crispiest fries and spicy hot Nashville sandwich.\n\nTrue up to Sean our excellent server we will be back again for another food adventure!","677":"I just discovered this Italian restaurant in Conshohocken and am so excited about this find! Real authentic Italian food at a VERY reasonable price! The establishment is a little small but decorated elegantly. There is also outside seating that is very casual. \n\nThe first time I came here it was for a work lunch. I was very impressed by the list of specials! They had a pasta special, salad special, sandwich, and 3 three other options as part of their daily switch up menu. I ordered the salad special that day which was a grilled sea bass with quinoa served with a lemon vinaigrette. DELICIOUS! I wish I could have a bottle of that dressing to take home. My coworker ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi dish with sausage and meatballs. The gnocchi was homemade at the restaurant and needless to say both of our plates were left clean.\n\nThe best part of the meal was easily dessert, if you go here then you NEED to order a cannoli! They are prepared at the restaurant and freshly filled. Easily one of the best cannolis that I have had in a while. \n\nThe only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that we sat outside during our meal and our waitress forgot about us as we were trying to pay the bill. She was still very great throughout the meal. I will definitely be returning!","678":"Food 10\/10\nCocktails 9\/10\nService 10\/10\n\nWe were sat immediately, hostess was super nice, got water instantly. Love that they give water pitchers for the table. Food took a bit for being mostly empty restaurant but the quality of what we were served was AWESOME. The bone marrow app was RAD. I had the ceviche trio as my lunch, fish was fresh fresh!! and filled me up! Our server was Sean, he was friendly, prompt, helpful, kept our table cleared of dirty dishes. We will visit the cruisery next time we are in town!","679":"The Cruisery itself, was not my favorite. That being said, Rani was nothing short of phenomenal. Honestly, would recommend requesting her. You will get the red carpet treatment.","680":"No complaints here! This is a relaxed restaurant with a funky hip vibe (though I was afraid the bikes that were strung in the middle of the restaurant would fall on me, but that's just because I'm a paranoid individual). \n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a group of four, and we all had a wonderful time. We were able to snag the happy hour deals - drinks for $7 and apps for less than $10! I had the skinny margarita (which was salted to perfection tbh), boyfriend had the lavender lemonade (tasted supes refreshing), friend had the smoked vanilla bourbon (which was honestly so delicious), and the other friend had to drive (ha). Two friends had flatbreads - steak & arugula and the banh mi, which were both very appetizing. I had the carnitas tacos, which were a bit spicy but were very tasty. And my boyfriend finished his entire BLT + fries (he was regretful after, but in the moment he was ecstatic). \n\nFor all 4 of us with drinks and entrees, it was less than $100 for a really great meal and great service. They also have several Axxess deals, so make sure to use your card! \n\nOverall, this is a really great restaurant to try if you are looking for a nice place to grab drinks and dinner at a decent price!","681":"excellent cocktails and decent beer. we also had some crack fries and wings both were very good!\nthe elote is basically just roasted corn and a bit of cheese, doesnt even attempt to imitate an authentic Elote, wouldnt recommend that. must order food with drink bc of Covid rules, the outdoor sitting area is cute and has heaters\/umbrellas for the elements. will definitely return!","682":"Ok so this place is legit. First off, great staff, friendly, fun, energetic and hard working and happy to be working which says a lot about the owner Hakan. Restaurants are struggling to find help and he is staffed...Says a lot about this establishment and ownership.  \nAmbience is classic with bicycles everywhere and comfortable fun setting.  \nFood is classic gastropub fare and very well made and the beer which is made in house is damn good and oh ya, the mixed drinks are so good!  Check it and support this place!","683":"Everything was great! Our waiter, Shawn, was fast and kind, basically excellent! Loved the beer and the beef pork sliders! 5 stars for sure!","684":"We stopped by this place while walking in Downtown Santa Barbara, and the owner was awesome and so inviting. The ambience is unique with a vintage\/modern bike theme that we really lived. The margaritas were EXCEPTIONAL and authentic tasting with a toasted lime for added intrigue. We had so much fun here and would d finitely recommend if you're looking for a good spot to grab a drink downtown.","685":"I am confused about all the positive reviews. \n\nThere's not much open in SB on a Tuesday night at 9, which is how I ended up at The Cruisery. It looked like any gastropub, so I figured it couldn't be too bad. \n\nI ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the ahi tuna tostadas. Easily the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had, including the time I undercooked chicken at home and ate three bites before realizing.\n\nThe chicken was so salty it was hard to take more than a bite of. The pickles and slaw were pretty tasteless, or maybe just overpowered by the over seasoned chicken. It was also very spicy in an unenjoyable way - not like hot chicken should be, but like someone who has never tasted hot chicken developed this recipe with the goal of making an inedible sandwich. The fries were hard and cold but refreshingly bland compared to the chicken.\n\nMy girlfriends ahi tuna tostadas were similarly inedible. The tuna wasn't fresh and the whole plate was rather wilted like it had been sitting out for a while.\n\nDrinks were similarly underwhelming.","686":"Excellent skinny margaritas - they taste like the beach! The Kung Pao sprouts are a must and it's a great location on State Street!","687":"I have been here a few times and have had decent experiences. However, I have always noticed the host\/owner having an attitude with customers. I had a bad experience tonight and will probably not go back. \nChecking the reviews and his replies I am reassured he is not great with customer service. \nHopefully he sees the importance in maintaining a relationship with his local customers, and decides to change his outlook.","688":"Picked up a pizza on the way home the other night. It was great. Hot and ready when I arrived for pickup and very tasty. Only downside was the Crust was a tad bit crispy but not objectionable. Good stuff.","689":"Absolutely wonderful experience. The staff were super friendly. The food was amazing. And loved that it was super dog friendly. Will definitely be coming back!","690":"Roni was an amazing server she kept checking up on up and gave us everything we needed when we needed it. I loved her.","691":"Amazing food, drinks, service, and ambiance. In the heart of Santa Barbara and great people watching. They even brought our dog his own dog bed. We had the beef sliders and they were delicious. Best margaritas in Santa Barbara! We will definitely be back.","692":"Beer was good but kind of annoying you have to buy an entree per beer you order. So we wanted to get only carne fries to share with a beer each, but they made us order another entree. And when Guac is $11, it becomes two very expensive beers.","693":"I was going to write a review on a situation that occurred with the \"Owner\"  whom my family and I had while visiting this place, but it seems there are already reviews on how this guy cannot handle himself correctly. \n\nLong story short, we drove up to Santa Barbara from Loma Linda (2 hour drive) I stumble upon this place via IG and Yelp, and because we are a bike riding family theme we definitely wanted to check this place out. \n\nDoors were open and there was no host at the stand, So we walked in to admire the decor. Suddenly, I look down and there's a man rushing aggressively towards me yelling that we can't be inside. *Btw where we are from, our \"rules\" for COVID are completely different, so I understood that we made a mistake first. \n\nWe shrug off the angry little man and start to head out the doors, but we continues to follow us on the door yelling \"it's the law you can't be in here\" and then start yelling and degrading the Host because he wasn't at the stand to stop us from walking in. I turned around and apologize to the host and told him it was completely our fault for just walking in. I turn to the \"owner\" and I tell him that I was more than happy to spend my money here but now I will take my business somewhere else, the \"OWNER\" responded, \"Good take it somewhere else we don't want it here...\" \nWell sure enough I did. I went down to Night Lizard Brewery and enjoyed a beer. \n\nI've been in the hospitality industry for 7 years and I have never witnessed such anger aggression. Do yourself a favor \"Owner\" dude, hire a manager to handle your floor and customers because, not only do you seem to be a liability, I don't think you have the proper temperament to be handling people.","694":"My wife and I had some of the best bacon burgers we've ever had here. Great service, clean, and the rest of the menu looked delicious, too. Can't wait to come back!","695":"One of the best places in conshy!! Great little Italian spot! Every pasta dish is top notch!!","696":"The food was really good, the chicken was cook to perfection and the sauce was so buttery with the right amount of spice. The basmati rice complemented the sauce and the chicken perfectly. The service 10\/10, parve one of the hostess provided great hospitality and treated me as though I was a guest dinning at her house. You can tell that the cooks cook with passion because the quality of the food was amazing. Lastly, if your in the area and are craving Indian food check this place out you will not be disappointed.","697":"We ran across this lovely spot on our road trip from Oceanside. The owners were so friendly and took the time to talk to us about our hometown.","698":"I went here during fiesta after spending lots of money on the bar already.\nGreg, Jenn, Dustin & Darian were amazing when i initially approached Unbearable & got drinks (2), \nWhen I had been there earlier in the evening,\nAaron and the security would not let me in when I came back to the bar not nearly as intoxicated & did not give an actual reason as to why I wasn't allowed back into the bar. Security is great & doing their job as they are told. Aaron (the owner) absolutely sucks. Do not come here if you want to enjoy your evening.","699":"We came here for an early Sunday dinner and we sat outside with our two pups. We choose the cruisery because they are dog friendly and even have a small dog menu! Our dog got the 'Good Girl' which just had dog-friendly chicken and potatoes. It was gone in 2 min so I'm pretty sure he liked it! \n\nThe cocktails were yummy and gave us a tiki bar vibe. 'The Floor is Guava' was sweet, fresh, and strong, as a good drink should be!  I recommend trying it. The 'Pineapple Express' was not very sweet and had an interesting smokey flavor. \n\nThe food was good! It's pretty simple food, but the toppings and sauces elevated it to a higher level. The carne asada fries were bomb with juicy, tender filet mignon. I really enjoyed the shoestring fries, but one person in my party thought thicker fries might be better with the thick pieces of meat. The Nashville hot chicken was super hot, if you aren't sure about the heat level you can order the sauce on the side. \n\nThe location was great and we could people watch from the street patio. The service was awesome, and the waiters had no problem stepping over our sleeping pups! \n\nI highly recommend stopping by with your pupper for some refreshing drinks and yummy food for all!","700":"This place is PHENOMENAL! My friend and I were greeted by Andrew when we drifted over to the sandwich area. He recommended the best sandwiches (I got the Cuban and my friend got the TN Trio), and he did not steer us wrong; they were delicious! He came out to our table and chatted with us about the concept behind Caviar and Bananas, then offered to give us a tour of the place. Since we were short on time, we settled for a tour of the desserts area. We asked for his recommendations on desserts, and he pointed out his three favorites. We each selected something, and he personally took the time to package our selections, then sent us on our way with the desserts on the house. The atmosphere here is AMAZING! We fully plan on going back this week! It's like a bit of NYC is here in Nashville. It really elevates the area and is a fun place to grab a bite to eat! Thanks, Andrew! You are super classy! :D","701":"Good food, GREAT beer (especially the Armed Stroberry you've got to try it!), great people! Met the owner and he is a very fun and kind guy. Beers are locally made and can't be found anywhere else. Def give this a go when you are in town!","702":"Stopped off at the Cruisery for a quick drink before dinner last night. The host was super friendly and seated us right away on a table outside. Our server Linda was also very friendly but I'd say serving may not be her specialty. We ordered a couple of drinks and guacamole and chips since you can't just get chips and salsa for some reason and the guacamole ($11.99) comes with salsa too. LAME but whatever. The drinks came out quickly but the guac took forever. Took so long we have to really nurse our drinks to not finish them before getting the guac. We asked about it and she assured us it would be out soon and they were working on it. It eventually came out, literally 25 minutes, FOR GUACAMOLE. Apparently the kitchen thought they'd already made it and it was out to us. OK, mistakes happen. However, it's the server's job to keep things moving and being aware of their guests. Side note, there were only 7 tables going at this time so not busy at all. There's no reason she shouldn't have been able to be mindful of the missing guac. Then I asked for a soda refill. 10 minutes later I had to ask her again. In fact, I asked her on my way back from the bathroom as she was helping another table. During this time I'd seen her just standing around at the bar. So, all in all, the Cruisery is a decent watering hole. Lots of beers, full bar, no ciders. Everyone is friendly. Prices are decent. Not great server today and I suppose that's not the bars fault necessarily. With all of the bars in Santa Barbara to go to, I wouldn't bother again based on this experience. Sorry Cruisery!","703":"Arguably one of the best sushi restaurants in Edmonton, if not Alberta, this tiny hole in the wall is ridiculously popular. MAKE A RESERVATION. (there, I said it loudly.)\nA family run business, the service is friendly and efficient, always with a smile.\n\nI first tasted their sushi when they were a takeaway joint in an ill fated Asian Mall in Old Strathcona  many long dark years ago. It was amazing then, and remains so today. The move to a larger venue did not diminish the quality, but it is high time they moved to bigger quarters, yet again.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that it can get pretty cramped in there on any given night, and this is also the reason one must make reservations to get in.\nThe popularity has overwhelmed the seating capacity.\n\nThat complaint out of the way, the food is fabulous. Every time I have been in I have ordered something different, and each dish is as good as the last.\n\nIf you are a lover of good Japanese cuisine, Sushi Wasabi is for you.","704":"Haven't been able to try this place yet, and am looking forward to giving it a shot someday. HOWEVER, the bald guy at the front is a big jerk. I brought friends from out of town and we put our names down, but the guy was so rude we decided to go to a place down the street. You can do better Cruisery!","705":"The bald host guy is literally so rude and unprofessional. Basically assaulted my boyfriend for walking into the restaurant while we were putting our name in because he needed to go to the bathroom. He immediately freaked out and lost his temper saying \"get out of here\" and that he won't serve us now. Telling us that we are adults and need to \"watch the news\". This is all NEW to EVERYONE. Nobody inside the restaurant was wearing a mask so he thought it was okay to go to the restroom quickly. There is absolutely no reason to treat us the way we were just treated. So embarrassing and he needs to learn how to treat customers. Be better.","706":"Wonderful backyard patio filled with wood fire pits and exceptional staff. The amazing ah\u00ed tostadas paired with the flaming lips Maragrita made out evening complete!","707":"I finally checked this place out and absolutely loved the space! It's a huge difference from the previous brewery and I really love what they've done with it. They have great live music and it's super spacious so you never feel *too* crowded. \n\nMenu looks great so I'll definitely be back for one of their themed nights. I heard a tip that the Asian themed night is bomb! Prices for drinks are standard for state street, I'd say average $10\/drink.","708":"Was excited to eat here, but the bald guy who I'm assuming was the owner, was unnecessarily rude to us before we came in. Will not be coming back.","709":"Normally I love this place but tonight I felt highly offended. Instead of support or understanding I received threats of being kicked out after expressing my discomfort from a man who consistently and aggressively eyed me and my friends. \n\nDISCLOSURE LADIES: long dark brown haired man, fratty young guy with brown eyes (bartender with the stash) is NOT your friend.","710":"A spontaneous choice but was the start of a great night. The host has the type of contagious energy that you hope to come across.\n\nWe were visiting from Los Angeles and might come back just to feel his energy again.\n\nThe food was great... the beer was even better!\n\n10\/10","711":"Was super happy to have come here twice during my trip!  They are open for indoor and outdoor dining on beautiful State Street.  Very relaxed atmosphere with great food (had the Elote & Carnitas Tacos on my first trip, and SB's Best Wings on the second trip; they were crispy and delicious especially enjoyed the Spicy Thai sauce!)  Excellent service (Savanah was my server, she's awesome!  I will ask to sit in her section next time for sure!) House made beer was on point, Cocktails were solid!  the Fig & Haley and the Flaming Lips were dangerously delicious!  \n\nIf you are in Santa Barbara this chill place is a must!  Don't miss it!!!","712":"Visiting here from Spokane and this was our first stop! Food was great and so were the drinks! The hostess Dani was such a sweetheart and gave us some great recommendations to do around town! Definitely would check this place out.","713":"Great:  the cookies, and other baked goods.  The cookies are about the size of your head and thick.  They are three bucks, but probably the size of 3 regular cookies, easily. The mint oreo chocolate cookie was quality.  The chocolate chip cookie was a close second.  \n\nGood: Sandwiches.  My french dip sandwich was a 5, but my wife's salmon sandwich was a 4.  It was a bit \"fishy\" and the salmon was chopped up and a bit under seasoned.  The strawberry cake was a bit underwhelming, as was the peach carrot cake. \n\nLook good, but we didn't get it:  the salads and coffees. \n\nIt's a neat place and worth a visit.  Almost 5 stars, but I think ultimately it's hit and miss.","714":"The Cruisery is a cool place that really captures the SB vibe. I'm so glad that the home of the Santa Barbara Brew Co. for so many years is still a casual hangout with good food and friendly service. In fact, I'd say this place is an upgrade, as their beer selection far outstrips that of the previous tenant. In the post Covid era, it will also be a great place to catch a game with friends. \n\nLocated on the hoppin' 500 block of State, the Cruisery has a fantastic little Parklet that is perfect for people watching. It also has an excellent selection of brew-pubish foods like the chicken katsu sliders, the ahi club, and good flatbreads. Unless you arrive at the height of the dinner rush, you can almost certainly get a good spot, which can't be said for most SB spots. I definitely recommend The Cruisery for a casual, SB style dining experience.","715":"Great location, food, ambiance... came for a lunch today really liked it and re-visited for dinner. We ordered chicken tenders, asian chicken salad and chicken caprese flatbread... all of them were fantastic.","716":"We were sat at a table and ordered drinks and a flat bread pizza for our Child. Pizza was delicious and beer was great. We had another family member join us, so I grabbed another chair from a nearby table. Shortly after we could hear a man shouting at our table and the shouting got louder as he got closer. This individual which we later found out was the owner, was upset that we had to many people at our table and he asked that they leave, and that the table we were sat at was only meant for two. Keep in mind that the table had three chairs when we were sat because we were a party of three. Then he was upset because apparently the other chair that was taken didn't belong to his restaurant. We were in shock!! Don't attack your paying customers. That was very rude and unprofessional. Next time how about letting your hostess know and have them approach the table and politely let us know of our apparent wrong doing. Wont be back!!","717":"The cruisery on state street is awesome! Great beer brewed in-house and very dog friendly. Going to have to come back several more times to try all the things on the menu that I would like to.","718":"Fantastic food, beer, and service! I went on a lazy afternoon with a couple friends, and the owner Hakam happened to be there. He strongly suggested the Ahi Tuna Tostada for lunch with an accompanying Liquid Sunshine lager. Both were incredible. The tostada was super fresh all around and the fish was perfect. However they make the lime aioli, I almost asked for a growler-full to take home! The lager was great, and accompanied my meal perfectly. Throughout the meal Hakan came by to chat and check in with us. Overall, it was an amazing lunch that I won't forget. Would 100% recommend stopping by here for food or just one of their delicious beers","719":"Entirely satisfied with our experience at this place. The food was awesome and Kaitlin went above and beyond to make sure we were always helped out in the quickest fashion; not common these days. \n\nCome here, get the Bahn Mi flatbread.","720":"This has become one of my bfs and I favorite date night spots. We love the vibes and the service is always stellar. \n\nParticularly, I LOVE the Ahi Tostadas, as well as their Asada Fries. They also have this sauce aptly named \"crack sauce,\" need I say more!!\nEvery time we go, I have to get the drink \"Flaming Lips,\" spicy and sweet deliciousness.\n\nLast night, we got to sit inside for the first time, even though it's probably our 6th time visiting. Everything was socially distanced and staff was wearing masks.\n\nOur server, Heather I believe, was very kind and attentive. \n\nCruisery, we'll be back!!!","721":"the cruisery is one of the best local spots in santa barbara! they are one of the many establishments that are adamantly adhering to the covid regulations, which makes me feel very safe. the food is as good as it gets and always looks very aesthetic. the drinks are amazing too, my favorite is the 'impeachment punch'. i'm not a huge beer fan but they brew their own beers in house and my friends really enjoyed them. everything is fairly priced and the happy hour menu offers some great deals. the staff is super friendly and welcoming, especially the hostess jenny who made sure to inform us of all the safety regulations they were performing. i'm looking forward to continue supporting this establishment!","722":"Did a take out order and was impressed by how fast the food came out.  And very surprised by their portion size.  I got the bahn mi flatbread and it was delicious! One flat bread is more than enough to satisfy two very hungry people as the toppings were loaded on top.  And made the mistake of ordering chicken tenders and fries....which is enough to feed 2-3 people.","723":"A bit on the pricier side for Indian takeout but high quality food! Loved the lamb biryani- it is a bit in the oily  end but still extremely flavorful. Portions are okay.","724":"Food was delicious! Lavender Lemonade cocktail was amazing. Asia was so helpful with recommendations and really made dinning here a great experience!","725":"This place is a local gem. The service is outstanding, the craft beers are fantastic (Armed Strobbery is my personal favorite) food is amazing, and the owner Hakan is so friendly and engaged with his customers...we will be back, I highly recommend!","726":"The vibe was wonderful! The food was great. But, service was the best. Ask for Shawn's table. He's the best! You won't be disappointed! Great experience overall. Don't miss this dog friendly restaurant. Believe it or not they have three options on the menu for your puppies! Highly recommend this restaurant.","727":"Cute little spot to grab a beer and a bite to eat! There's indoor and outdoor seating, everyone was super friendly. Their menu was cute and witty, they have a couple games at the table. The portions were kind of small in my opinion for prices but for the area I'm sure it's average. The food was good. A few items we got was the shrimp po boy, grilled fish tacos and sliders.","728":"The Cruisery has great vibe, nice interior aesthetic, solid menu, and dog-friendly staff and ownership. See photo of owner loving up my friend's dog. Solid brunch also.","729":"Caviar & Bananas offers a distinctive food experience.  i call it a type of urban market.  walk into a nice coffee bar, then walk through the beautiful desserts, pass by wines , variety of cheeses, walk pass unique market products, then order   a personal specialized salad, or over to the deli market for a custom sandwich and\/or lovely freshly made deli selections.  watch the bakery at work.  your choice.  drop in yourself or meet friends, its set up for either.  i'm heading back soon....................","730":"What a great place to start. Great food and fantastic drinks! Added bonus is the bar drink artists! Dustin was our server and has incredible knowledge of the beer making process! One of our best experiences for sure!","731":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with coworkers and had a rad time. \n\nWe shared the beet salad, the Bahn mi flatbread, shrimp tacos, and the mango confetti crudo.\n\nKayla was extremely attentive and down to earth. She made sure our experience was top of the line. \n\nJustin, the manager, stopped over to see how everything was. Super personable.  Very safe dining experience during these weird times!\n\nThe mango confetti crudo and flat bread was a beautiful work of art. Highly recommend eating and drinking here.","732":"I was out of town. Saw their menu and wanted to try their food. Had my dogs so I wanted to order to go. Plus with corvid, still not comfortable dining in. Nice waitress tried accommodating my order. But this guy with his two dogs, very rude, said they could not. Right after me they accommodated for a group of 4. Never going back.","733":"What a great place with a cool atmosphere and vibe. Let me explain my dissatisfaction and the reason for giving this only 2 stars when it deserved a much higher rating. I went with my dog to this restaurant and was there for over 3 hours and all the sudden the host came to my table and said the restaurant only allows service dogs. This was kind of weird because he was the one who let me in with my dog. He said my dog was barking which was not true. My English Bulldog was playing with someone at the table next to me and barked for a moment in fun. Then the host who was very unprofessional and not friendly told me the restaurant only allows service animals???? I told him I have been here for 3 hours and everything was fine and you are now giving me a warning. This host ruined what was to that point a great experience with awesome food and drink. My waitress was awesome as well. My advise to the owner is to make sure all your employees offer great customer service because one jerk like their host can ruin a great experience.","734":"Shawn was so helpful! He made sure we liked our cocktails  and recommended the fan favorites when I was about to get something maybe not so favorite. The wings were super good. The Asada fries were super good and the Room for Activities drink was sooo good! He really made sure we loved our meal and was very personable.","735":"The food was decent and our waitress was fantastic. The issue we had was that the owner\/manager was completely disrespectful of customers. We watched him yell at a young girl (who was a customer) for going to the bathroom. He accused her of not being a diner- even though she kept pointing to her table and her mother. He was harsh and cold and it was unnecessary, Later we also witnessed him yell at a table. Who yells at paying customers? I get covid has stressed people out- but if the mgmt here cant figure out how to talk to paying guests this place won't be around much longer. My husband and I left feeling uncomfortable and wont be back!","736":"One of the more disappointing dining experiences I've had in a long while. The server dropped my meal and brought it back with 1\/2 the amount of fries :\/ then we had servers come to us 3 times with other people's food and drinks. Everything seemed very unorganized. However the atmosphere was pleasant and they go for an upscale modern look that's what gets them 2 stars instead of 1. It's just unfortunate the food quality and taste does not meet the appearance.\n\nWe waited quite some time for our food and it arcane out at different times. My ahi tuna sandwich came with a Cajun seasoning that was no where to be mentioned on the menu and was way too hot so I had to send it back. The waiter was nice to replace it and the manager himself brought out my dish. Special treatment! So they obviously care about their customers, which I appreciate. The chickens avocado sandwich was ehhh. Not much too it.\n\nI'll maybe this place just isn't my taste buds because it seems like other people like it according to other reviews. Maybe I need to give it another try. But after having 2 items that were both thumbs down, it's hard to want to.\n\nMy friend's Cajun sandwich was not that good. She actually said she was suffering through it and my fianc\u00e9's burger was a 2\/5. The fries were tastey but cold.\n\nMy dog loved her chicken and mashed potatoes though!","737":"Worst experience dealing with host\/owner (Bald short guy). Extremely rude. Save your money.","738":"I am in love!  I can be pretty picky about my Italian food since my mother is a fabulous cook, however this place takes the cake!  From the homemade pasta, to the creaminess of their sauces, to the very delicate and delicious calamari; it is just superb all around. \n\nThe food:  Items I have tried there are the fried calamari with the sweet and spicy chili sauce, the pescatore, gorgonzola chicken, sachetti milano, and the grilled vegetable lasagne.  I would recommend ANY of these items, however if it is your first there definitely get something with pasta.  It is homemade and out of this world.  This last time I went I tried the gorgonzola chicken and feel in love.  It is going to be difficult for me to switch and try something new the next time I am there.  My dining guests ordered the pescatore and were notified before ordering that they were out of mussels but would make up for it by adding additional seafood of the customers choice.  We agreed that was no problem at all because it is good to know they would only have this food item in stock if it was fresh, and they are not keeping a back up supply frozen. \n\nParking: plenty of on street parking, but if you park in the lined spaces back in the space; I believe it is a rule in that part of Conshohocken.\n\nI would highly recommend putting in a reservation because it is a small place, however BYOB which is a nice touch.  Do no be discouraged by the prices because it is all worth it.  Huge portions with great quality food that is only matched in awesome small Italian places in Philly.","739":"First of all, any person that gives this place anything above 2 stars either has poor taste in food or has lost their tongue to some terrible disaster. Or they've had too much of their BYOB prior to dinner. Unfortunately, this was my first and last time at this place. It would've been a more pleasurable experience, outside of the food being flavorless and watered down, had one of the owners been more accommodating and understanding. After sending our food back TWICE, we were made to feel as though our taste buds were not like everyone else's. Specifically, the owner said, \"Everyone else has ordered the bolognese and nobody else has complained.\" Mind you, my friend who we were dining with had been there over 10 times. She knew the food. We thought after the send back, we would be compensated in some way--nope. Bill was as is. The owner then came out combative once we questioned this practice as well. We literally ate 2-3 bites at most. I will never come back. My friends and their families will never come back. Having moved from Chicago and dined in many different establishments, this review could've been saved had the customer service been as it should have been. Total disaster. If you pass this review by because you think I'm a disgruntled customer, please read my other reviews. I'm honest and happy to give kudos when they deserve it. Buco di Beppo is better than this place. Seriously.","740":"Overpriced for what you get and the layout of the restaurant is confusing. Everything is served in plastic containers with plastic ware, even if you dine in. Seems very wasteful.","741":"I've had one of the best burgers in my life at the Cruisery. The combination platter appetizer is beyond amazing & delicious. Their brownie with ice cream is probably the best dessert I have had in the last couple of years. \nOur server, Hannah, was awesome & very helpful. \n\nI would definitely come back again next time I visit SB.","742":"The food here is great and the ambience is fun but it's much more fun to be in the front of the restaurant then on the back patio. Drinks are delicious as well but I recommend ordering a beer as they're one of the oldest breweries in Santa Barbara! Was unimpressed with the cocktails, but they did the trick.","743":"great place for drinks. I came on a Friday at 6 PM and there was no wait for an indoor table (although we would've preferred to get an outdoor table). it wasn't too busy and I loved how dog friendly this place was (they even have some options on the menu for dogs!!)\n\nI ordered the Plan-C because the idea of it was just so funny but the drink was absolutely delicious. Not too sweet but not too strong either and really refreshing. My friend ordered the lavender lemonade and it really just tasted like lemonade haha \n\nfantastic drinks! the only food we ordered were the disco asada fries which were a bit heavy and much bigger than expected. Super good though!","744":"Great local establishment...Awesome happy hour, delicious food, incredible staff, Parker ROCKS, and personable owner!!! We highly recommend!!!","745":"I think this is the old Santa Barbara Brewery. If you're looking for decent food, I don't recommend it. Drinks were fine. I was actually hungry, and didn't enjoy the grilled chicken sandwich. It was a bit bland for my taste.","746":"Came here quickly for a drink. Ordered a beer (I believe the ch\u00e2teau de v\u00e9lo) during happy hour. Loved the atmosphere. Chill spot. I'd be back!","747":"I walked to this place which is located next to a bunch of homes. I could smell the deliciousness as I walked up to it a block away. I was able to get a seat by the window and enjoyed people watching while waiting on my meal. There is outdoor seating and people enjoyed being seated outside even in the cold weather. I ordered a seafood white wine pasta which was phenomenal.  The food hit the spot, and made my night. The place is byob, so if you want to enjoy some wine with their great food, make sure you bring a bottle with you. The service was great as well.  I went home satisfied and happy.","748":"Quick delivery service, great food, west coast grade spice level (which is good). Would recommend highly.","749":"The only reason they are getting 1 Star is the bread! The bread is AMAZING! \n\n1. Shrimp and Crab scampi - terrible.  Sauce tasted like watered down chicken broth.  Crab tasted the way propane smells and the shrimp eh, ok.  Not much flavor but cooked well.  The noodles were not very good, mushy. \n\n2. Bolognese - we do not even think we received the correct dish.  There was no ground beef, all mushrooms. However, the sauce was tasty. But again the spaghetti noodles were not very good. \n\nTotal disappointment. Will not return.","750":"Owner Hakan serves a mean Nashville hot chicken sandwich, it had me in tears!  Awesomely GOOD!  We are visiting from out of town and he and his staff made our visit to his restaurant an enjoyable experience.  We will make it a destination when we're in town.  The Cruisery is the best bar and restaurant experience.  Thank you Hakan! . Richie Rich","751":"Love this place! Beer is made in house and food is great quality bar food. Ahi tuna sandwich is my favorite here. Server Asia was above and beyond wonderful! Great service and atmosphere.","752":"LOOOOVE ! We were just walking around State St. looking for a good brunch spot and came across this place so we decided to try it out. The options are amazing! I was so pleasantly surprised. I got a mimos of course and it was perfect ! They give you the OJ on the side which was what I needed because I like to make my own ratio. Then the food was DELISH!! I got the avocado toast with scrambled eggs on top and i loved it . The \"peanut oil\" scared me at first cuz I didn't want it to taste like peanuts but you don't taste it at all! We were overall so happy with our choice and DEF recommend this spot especially for brunch ! So many unique good choices","753":"I haven't had the pleasure of going here in person before, but my takeout meal was great! Carne asada fries and churros was the perfect way to the start the weekend.","754":"5 stars!  Great Margs and attention to detail.  Great for groups. The owner Hakan is amazing!","755":"This place is good for groups, great for dogs! The menu offers actual entrees for dogs! The drinks are pretty but not that much alcohol in the drink so beware. The food is delicious and the portions are decently sized. The must order item here is the fries! Just order them. Their happy hour menu has a selection of beer and mixed drinks along with appetizers to have for yourself or share with the group. The jalape\u00f1o poppers are delicious but some will surprise you if you are spicy sensitive. The chicken fajitas are delicious and tortillas are soft. The waitress was really sweet and accommodating with our large group and made sure we were all taken care of!","756":"Host was rude and sarcastic. Left immediately. Asked about the place and told me to back off and get in line.","757":"Downtown 420 living at the Cruisery lucky us! Just had the best happy hour on State Street. Crushed the skillet nachos and Kung pow sprouts! Hung with the owner Hakan Who is full of life and congeniality. Can't wait to come back highly recommend this fun brewery.","758":"Had a lovely time at The Cruisery. The owner Hakan came by our table and gave my pup Baloo lots of love and attention and a delicious meal off their dog menu. Which he absolutely LOVED! Great food, cocktails, and service! Thanks Cruisery!","759":"Love this place! Amazing service. They even brought my dog a dog bed so she can be cozy with us next to the heater. Delicious food, including a dog menu!","760":"A cool location on the lower end of State Street. It was on the slow side but busy enough to be entertaining. The music was low which made it conducive to conversation. The place had a vibe that was absolutely funky in a good way. We waited for seating and landed a table almost immediately. After being greeted by our waiter we ordered up a round of drinks. The waiter was a bit of a character in an absolutely good way. The drinks landed with three beers being a hit and the cocktail as a miss. We informed our server who thought we were pulling his leg. We had to impress upon him that there was absolutely something wrong with the cocktail as delivered. He came back and said the bartender insisted it was spot on. After a little more insistence the drink was remade and tasted as expected. The menu had a great variety of options without being over the top with options. Our table ordered up the New Mexico Cobb, Chicken tacos and a couple Nashville Hot Chicken sandwiches. The food name out in short order and it all looked tasty. The chicken sandwiches were very good. The New Mexico Cobb was nice as were the chicken tacos. About five minutes into eating we realized both the Cobb and the Tacos had no avocado. It seemed like a long wait until we were checked in on. When we finally were we asked why there was no avocados on two of the dishes. I'm not sure if the waiter was joking or being serious but we were told they were out of avocados. Hard to imagine that wasn't communicated and was instead left up to us to discover. Would certainly return for the beer, but would likely pass on ordering a cocktail or any food.","761":"This was our first time here, and we were immediately surprised by how welcoming they were and how willing they were to accommodate our two small dogs. The cocktails and beer were all very good, and our server, Shaun, took fantastic care of us. We will definitely be coming back.","762":"Great Lunch and then shocking behavior by the manager\/owner Aron Ashland. Yesterday, we were two couples enjoying our lunch inside when 2 middle-aged female friends saw us and stopped by to say hello to us. We were having a brief and friendly chat. All was well, and then, suddenly, Aron Ashland burst upon the scene and verbally threatened our friends, who had taken their masks off to talk. He yelled at them and then physically pushed each of them out of the restaurant. The scene was shocking and disturbing. It was an unlawful touching,and an assault of the two women. The entire magnitude of the event began to sink in and we were all stunned and taken aback by the intensity and physical domination perpetrated by Aron Ashland. One of our party ran out to check on the well-being of the two affected women and understandably they were quite shakened physically and mentally by the owner's intimidation and physicality. Our effort here is to inform customers to be aware of such erratic and dangerous behavior at this establishment. I plan to meet with the Better Business Bureau and advise other relevant parties today. \n\nDennis Ryan \nBakersfield, California","763":"Such a cool place.  Had the pleasure to be treated by Danny the hostess and she was amazing. Didn't get the opportunity to be served by her but with we did have a good time. Anyways great place and amazing drinks.","764":"I've been going to this place for months now, and I've always had an incredible experience. The food is 12\/10, and I couldn't even legitimately rate the drinks because they would break the scale (great selection, fresh and diverse ingredients). The Cruisery is unique, reasonably priced for what you get, and always has impeccable service. I went today during the whole coronavirus situation (it was my first time going out, aside from groceries and work), and was pleasantly surprised by how well they were prepared for it. Everything was clean, socially distancing was on point, and the waiters\/waitresses were as friendly and as quick as ever. I'll always continue to support this place, because it never ceases to impress me and exceed my expectations. Overall, I highly recommend.","765":"Seemed to be the only bar that offered happy hour which was so clutch!! My friends and I ordered the Forgeat My Manners, Lavender Lemonade, & Say Crack Again. All were on the sweet side of the drinks. We also ordered Skillet Nachos which were pretty small and had no meat in them. They were still good as a side to the drinks though! The waitresses were really nice and I recommend coming here for those who want that happy hour!","766":"So we went in restaurant week...\nRes at 8.30...app came at 9.40!!! (After bread at least).\nShrimp was 2 shrimp which was a little disappointing after 1 hour wait.\nWas about 40 minute wait for them to take order.\nWe had the res at 8.30 and though we could go to the cinema after for a film at 9.45...we didnt leave the restaurant until 10pm (lucky we cancelled the cinema)\nFood was tasty. Nice atmosphere. Might try this place and give them another chance outside of restaurant week but not going to rush.","767":"Love this place! Love the concept, the food, the quality, size. Only negative is the TINY garage and only one free hour of parking. It's becoming increasingly harder to find parking in Nashville, especially in this area. I try to go early to avoid any stress in finding a spot. Also, the garage is TINY!!! Not sure what they were thinking when they made such small spaces and low clearance.\nAnyway, on to the food. I've now had several salads and desserts. Everything was great, but the show stopper is the Far East salad. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do love fresh veggies on a salad. It's wonderful! The sesame peanut thai vinaigrette is sinful, so I get mine on the side to not overindulge. Fresh fresh fresh ingredients and you can make up your own salad. I love the concept!! One of these days I'll try the sandwiches, but there is so much to choose from here, you just pick your station. There is a wine cooler, to-go food and a dessert case. The large cookies are good, but some of the desserts were super sweet. I'm sticking with my salads! YUM!","768":"Had a terrific Valentine's dinner here.  First, BYOB is great. You get to save money there. The waitresses were very friendly; they were busy but still kept us happy. The complimentary bread was terrific and plentiful.  We had the prix fixe menu (3 courses $50 which is very reasonable.  Had a terrific salad, bacon wrapped shrimp, and Surf and Turf.  In the end i was very full and happy. \n\nThe location is a bit strange but the inside is very nice.  It's small but quiet.  Great spot for a date-again the byob...\n\nWould love to go back","769":"Nice place with a cool concept. Unfortunately, I went during lunch and it was pretty packed, but that's not a bad thing and in no way reflects negatively on the establishment. I got the Seattle Ceasar salad (I know, not very adventurous, but it sounded good), it was tasty and I liked it, though I would have liked a little more Salmon in the salad. The group I was with had good things to say about their food, so I'm guessing all the food is pretty good and next time I'll try something different. Personally, I'm not crazy about standing in line to order, then walking to another area to pay, then sitting down to eat, the format seems too 'fast food' for such a nice place, but that's just my opinion. All in all, I enjoyed it and will more than likely return again.","770":"Not impressed. Heard (and read) great things about this place, so decided I had to check it out. The night I went in was a Thursday, but it was completely packed. I guess these other people heard good things too. I had high expectations, but left disappointed. Why? Prices are on the high side and the food is bland and minimal. For the cost you'd expect either lots of food or high quality, and we got neither. Tiny portions and very average Japanese food. And service on this day was quite slow. Maybe I'll have to try again to give it another shot, but on this day, the food and the whole experience left much to be desired. I  actually seriously prefer Banzai.","771":"Love this place! \nThe atmosphere in this place is warm and welcoming! I came here for dinner and chose to order the Moe Szyslak beer which has passion fruit and guava notes from moisac hops, it's so yummy! Definitely recommend if you like a fruity brew! After enjoying my beer I ate the smash burger! OMG yummy! It was perfectly made! Overall recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a chill night with good brews!","772":"This spot has a lot of potential. It hasn't been open long enough and still has some kinks to work out. The service was pretty slow for so many people working there on a Wednesday night. \n\nIt's really cute inside with their beach cruiser theme. I like the open seating and that it's dog friendly. I ordered the State & Fig, their bourbon based cocktail and it was pretty good. \n\nI'll definitely be back. Four stars.","773":"Had the ahi sandwich and it was amazing! The servers were also very friendly. Would recommend this place to any of my friends and will definitely be returning soon.","774":"Great service and great drinks. The whisky smash was my favorite! The spicy pretzels were also delicious, especially with the cool and fruity drink.","775":"The food is amazing. This is a perfect example of why you can't judge a book by its cover. The chef is creative and committed to excellence. Thank goodness this gem is hidden in Conshy. Shhhhh... Our secret.","776":"The atmosphere and decor is about the only thing this place has going for it. If you want pricey drinks, small portions and gross tasting water then this is the place. The water is prebottled tap water that tastes terrible. We asked for out burger lettuce wrapped, something very common at every place that sells burgers, and we got a piece of Sad lettuce on our burger. The Katsu sandwich wasn't too bad but was very heavy on the sauce. Not to mention our order was nearly $40 for 3 people without drinks. I don't recommend this place whatsoever, keep walking down state street and go somewhere else.","777":"I came to Cruisery for the first time on Sunday after hearing incredible things about it.  I was SOOOO impressed with this spot - everything I had been hearing was true!\n\nMy favorite spot to hangout here is actually in the back of The Cruisery...if you walk out the back towards the restrooms, you will see another space that is super open with the same drink and food menus (although you do have to order your food in the main restaurant and then take it back to the game room).\n\nFor starters the ambiance here to super fun and there are lots of games (table games AND ping pong, ski ball, and bags - aka cornhole).  They have an extensive drink menu and A LOT of fun\/refreshing spritz's.  The drinks average around $10 which is pretty reasonable for a bar of this caliber.  In my opinion, the best part about coming here was how absolutely friendly all of the servers and bartenders were.  All of the bartenders were super helpful and knowledgeable about the drink menu and what The Cruisery had to offer.  \n\nFor a snack, our table ordered the chips and salsa and the crack fries...let me just say....why have I never had fries with firecracker sauce until now?? It was SOOO good! \n\nEverything about The Cruisery was so impressive, I will be back soon!","778":"Went for dinner with a group. They can't handle being busy. Terrible service. Couldn't get the table cleared for us (we had reservations). Had to wait outside in the cold. Once seated we couldn't get waited on. Had to flag a waitress for water. Finally came to take our order but no one had mentioned the specials so they had to tell us then come back again, which took too long. Food was average but with very high prices. Some in the group wanted to take their leftovers home but they were thrown out. What a mess. I know people love this place and maybe this was an off night but we won't be back. Oh, did I mention it was so loud you couldn't hear thunder?","779":"Went in here and it was empty and the people working were so rude. Every time I asked a queue in they responded like I was an idiot and bothering them. Just one example. - \"Is this my coffee?\" \"Yeah that's why I said your name\". My friend ordered a coke and they never got it for her and then glared at her when she asked for the drink she paid for. Terrible customer service.","780":"The server's provided fast and excellent service. Had chicken tacos and carnitas tacos, both very good.","781":"Let me start off by saying this is my first yelp review. That is saying a lot since I've been a user for years. \n\nFirst off I'm going to say the employees and service are great, this is not a review about the food, and hopeful not a reflection on the main dining room. \n\nI really wanted to like this place and have visited multiple times. Was excited when I had heard that they had opened the back bar once again. Being a local have enjoyed that location for years as a sports bar, Fig & Haley, SB Brew Co. \nNow one would think upon visiting, present date, that this is still a sports bar. TVs everywhere, tiered seating. Now come one of the biggest sporting nights in Cali, the Kobe Bryant remembrance game, I walk in no sound. Every TV has on the game, but loud music that no one cared about was blaring. We request the sound to be turned  on for the game. Now mind you this is 7pm, not party hour, not the main dinning room, not many people in the bar.  Another group of 20 people come in and also request the sound be put on. We are told that the sound cannot be turned on due to management. The manager comes out, or could be the owner, and is talked to about getting the sound on. They refuse to put the sound on and they watched 20 plus people, including myself and a friend, walk out the door losing probably 3 hours of sales from all those people. This is the same manager\/owner that I have seen taking a whole couch up  with his dogs and paperwork in front of a TV when patrons would love to sit there to watch a football game. Needless to say this place has lost a local's money and all the people I would have brought in with me or recommended the spot too. We are in desperate need of a good sports bar in town, unfortunately this is not it.\n\nJust updating the review to one star after reading the owners response and the responses he gave to anyone with anything negative that he could have took as something to work on for the business.","782":"This was the best Indian food I've ever had. My boyfriend who normally won't even touch Indian food tried the lamb kabobs and loved them. I would definitely recommend!","783":"This place is Bomb!  The \"3 wheats to the wind\" beer is better than Blue Moon or Shock Top by far! Food is excellent too.  If you are in the area, don't pass it up.  Worth your time!  Enjoy!","784":"This was one of my favorite places to come before the shutdown.  It's a cute place with sofas and tables, perfect place for a date or just to hang out and grab drinks with friends.  Can I just say, you HAVE TO get the seasoned french fries.  By far, the best fries I've had, and I am a french fry snob.  Service is friendly and all, too. Right now, they're just doing takeout but I can't wait till everything opens again.","785":"Wonderful casual dinner on State Street with friends for our first night in Santa Barbara. The atmosphere is somehow energetic and chill all at once -- there are bicycles dangling from the ceiling, an eclectic mix of artwork on the walls, and a welcome sign advertising the soup of the day: margarita.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nLavender Lemonade (3.75\/5): Refreshing, sweet, and tasty! Not a very strong drink at all, and the purple color is just too pretty. I only wish there was less ice -- just two sips in, I was sensing a need to pace myself so I wouldn't drink it all at once, though the heat was melting the ice so quickly that it started to get watery. I finished the whole drink before any entrees arrived.\n\nPork & Pine Flatbread (4\/5): Crispy and flavorful! We had hoped to see more pork on the flatbread (and ended up redistributing the wealth from our pork sliders), but the combination of pork, pineapple, and jalape\u00f1o flavors were wonderful. A great choice for Hawaiian pizza lovers!\n\nPork Sliders (4.5\/5): Favorite part of the meal! Each slider was generously stacked with pork (with a noteworthy amount spilling over to be eaten with a fork!), and buns were soft and warm. Could be a little dry at times, but overall a filling and satisfying dish.\n\nFries (4.2\/5): Comes with a special \"firecracker\"(?) sauce that I didn't care for much (think Skrillex, but as a sweet and sour sauce with a mid-spice crisis), but the fries were packed with flavor on their own. An appetizer for the table worth trying!","786":"Don't order from caviar for this restaurant. After confirming order at 7:30pm on a Saturday then saying they were preparing our order they cancelled it at 8:30pm. Yes an hour later! Can't say how the food is because we never received. Very poor business practice and should cancel well before this amount of time has passed so we can actually get dinner from somewhere else. Lost a potential future customer that's for sure.","787":"First time visit yesterday and had a great Brie and Chicken Sandwich. Ali our server was great and took us through all the menu items that we will have to try during our next visit","788":"I absolutely adore Rats and Grounds for Sculpture. Coming here is just a magical escape from reality. The food is stunning, and therefore worth the price, in my opinion. I've always experienced excellent service here. I love their Happy Hour, which is Tuesday-Friday, 3-7 pm. They have discounted wine and beer and some delicious small plates! You need to try the poutine immediately. They will even give you your drinks in a to-go cup so you can imbibe while wandering the grounds.","789":"I love what they have done with the space and the ambiance is great!  I ordered the root-beer vodka ~ house infused specialty to my dismay they were OUT!   So I ordered up a lemon drop martini (awful) but moving on to the GUMBO, oh yea baby it  was the best thing I have had since having it at the FRENCH QTR years ago ( my understanding it is same owner). My hubby and I both love Gumbo and we can't wait to go back it was so delicious and the hush puppies on the side were absolutely oh so yummy!  happy hour pricing is great!","790":"Two friends and I stopped by The Parish tonight for happy hour. I started off with a lovely glass of $3 red wine and we shared the bacon popcorn appetizer. I couldn't stop licking my fingers, and grabbing any last bits of seasoning from the bowl. For the main course I had the French quarter gumbo. It came in a bowl with a cute mound of rice in the middle and a smattering of hush puppies on the side. The gumbo was delicious and the hush puppies crunchy and tasty. One friend had the Parish burger and fries - I would have helped her finish it but I was already stuffed. The small bite I had made me want more. Our server was friendly and attentive. The only downside was that the decor didn't match the hipness of the menu. The private booth behind us looked inviting but the main dining area is a little bland. Perhaps this is a starting point and they will upgrade in the future.","791":"The Parish is amazing!  Amazing people!  Amazing food!  If you like food that was actually made for YOU! This the place!  Drinking Angel is amazing!  The Chop!  Steak Salad!  BEST BURGER in Tucson!  I love this place!  Put it on your list!","792":"Great view of the Catalinas; especially when it's raining! Friendly staff. Great beer selection. Never too busy, which is nice. Live music on most weekends. Good Bloody Mary!","793":"My fiance and I dined here for brunch on the Sunday morning of our four year anniversary. We've been to Grounds for Sculpture multiple times, and it is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL place. This was our first time, however, eating at Rat's. \n\nIt is located behind the grounds, but it isn't any less beautiful. I could feel myself getting overwhelmed with excitement by how gorgeous and bright the exterior was. The inside is just as classy. We were seated and we ordered a Blood Orange Pop (my fiance gave it a BIG thumbs up!), a mimosa (very strong but very good), and coffee (which was included with the brunch). After the set up was explained to us, we made our way to the buffet. \n\nThere is a LOT of options, especially if you're an omnivore. We, however, are vegetarians. There was still a ton for us to eat, but there was way more meat than there was non-meat. And that's okay! If you're a vegetarian, you will definitely find yummy food. Especially the pancakes, potatoes, omelettes, and pastry basket. All of it was A+ food. \n\nWe spent about two and a half hours there - eating and talking. This brings me to why one star was docked. While it was nice to relax before a long day of adventuring for our anniversary, we were on a schedule. The staff is VERY kind, but quite slow. We waited a long time for our check and a long time for them to process our payment. After our waiter brought out of finalized check, he also brought out another dish of desserts that said Happy Anniversary! in chocolate. Such a sweet touch! I would recommend brunch to anyone celebrating something special, because it IS pricey at 44 a person and extra for any drinks you may want (except the tap water, coffee, and tea).","794":"While the outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, this restaurant has never let me down.  Time after time and dish after dish I am always left extremely satisfied.  My go to is the P.E.I Mussels which are out of this world, but I've also thoroughly enjoyed the Drunken Angel, Smokin' Angel, The Oysters, Hot legs, and the list goes on...I literally have not had one bad\/regrettable thing on this menu.  This by and large is one of Tucson't best restaurant offerings.  I just wish it were closer, but if it were I'd probably be broke.","795":"I went to Rats for the first time with a party of six recently for lunch.  The place is beautiful.  Although the waitress was initially charming and helpful, she all but ignored us after taking our order.  I ordered a salad as an entree as there are almost no vegetarian options.  The salad was overdressed and unimpressive.  Three of our party ordered burgers which they enjoyed but there wasn't anything special about them.  Although we did not order any of the things the restaurant seems well known for, I expected much more for the price point of Rats.","796":"I have to say that my fianc\u00e9 and I were disappointed when we went there for my birthday last Thursday evening.  We have been to Rat's many times and never experienced this level of service.  Neither the Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel nor the waiter were up to par from what you would expect from such a restaurant.  The ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel was dressed down, called my fianc\u00e9 by his first name, showed the table and left. The waiter kept disappearing after taking orders for one person at the time.","797":"We were staying at the Hacienda del Sol and I was looking for a good lunch spot on our way out to I-10. We aren't from here. Found this on yelp. Glad we did. May have been one of the best burgers I've ever had (the parish). I had some great burgers in Texas. My wife loved her pasta the drunken angel. For desert we had the bread  pudding. All super delicious and a unique place to eat at!","798":"Wow is this place cool!  Our friend was telling us about it as well as the Sculpture Gardens around the facility.  We came here with a big group to celebrate my girl's birthday and came for a Sunday brunch.  The food selection was wide and far and really good.  Sweet and savory options...they even had meatloaf!  So cool, never saw that at a brunch before.  Lots of bloody mary options including one with bacon infused vodka.  A nice dessert plate was presented at the end with chocolate and fruity concoctions.  Afterwards we were able to view some of the grounds but there is a section that requires an admission fee to go any farther.  We will be back for further exploration there.  The building that Rat's is in was also really cool, open fireplaces, lots of different rooms, old fashioned bar with big crescent moon booths and even a Indian looking bungalow with pillows and blankets by a fireplace.  You just gotta see it for yourself!!","799":"I love the atmosphere and food of this restaurant. The view was awesome, and walking through the \"Grounds for Sculpture\" was amazing and relaxing.","800":"Great southern food!!  Great bloody Mary's","801":"Went for the first time last night, they had an awesome live band called \"Brokedown Palace\" (check them out if you can). The waitress stared me off with a Southside Sandia and advised that they had no french fries but they could be substituted with hush puppies (kinda disappointing) The Sandia was absolutely delish and did not disappoint!! I hadn't eaten all day so I ordered the crawfish hush puppies and the Bacon popcorn for starters (shared with others of course ) the hush puppies came out hot and over cooked (super dark brown and extra hard), the popcorn was to die for! I then ordered the Gumbo, instead of fish and chips - because they are out of chips- and it came out looking pretty good with a side of hush puppies cooked much better. The Gumbo had amazing flavor, but lacked a lot of substance - maybe 2-3 small pieces of andouille, some shredded chicken and a pile of rice on top. I then decided the try the Front porch Tea and that was tasty - the first time. \nSo here is where I kinda got annoyed: I went outside with my table mates( some were in the band) leaving half eaten popcorn and full drinks on the table and our bill not paid...only to return to a completely cleared table....when we got back, the formerly very nice waitress, blamed us and the hostess for the table being cleared. She unpleasantly brought us new drinks (mine was the front porch tea) and it tasted like watered down lemonade - awful...meanwhile the hostess is flashing my table dirty looks the rest of the night...and that's why I gave them an overall score of 3 stars for the band, Sandia, and the popcorn.","802":"I have been here a few times now and have enjoyed every visit.  \n\nThe pulled pork is very spicy!  But, I liked that.  The fish and chips are okay.  Not really chips, but fries.  The gumbo had some good flavor but is not my favorite.  I loved the po boy and the lamb flatbread.\n\nAnd last visit I got to have a limited offering hot chocolate that was to die for.  It had homemade infused rum, whip cream and marshmallow.  It was the best adult hot cocoa I have ever had.  \n\nOverall,  food is good, drinks are better and staff has been consistent.  I'll return for more.","803":"This place has AMAZING food! I went here after my college graduation and a few times for lunch and I have never been disappointed. You could cut their filet mignon with a spoon. They have a fun drink menu, a cool atmosphere, good staff, and a diverse enough menu for large groups. We had to contact the catering department and sign a contract for a party over a certain number (maybe 7?) which was a little of a hassle but totally worth it. \nThe backyard behind Rat's is simply breathtaking and great for a short walk after dinner. Prices are what you'd expect for a high quality restaurant in a good location.","804":"Wow...horribly bland lunch - nice ambiance, good service - totally boring food... They need a chef...we had heard so many good things about this resto, but...trout was old (so served with an \"olive\" sauce to mask the age), Proven\u00e7al Mezze was a confused mish-mash of Moroccan hummus, oddly spiced olives and left over ratatouille... We won't be back...","805":"This place is awesome! Whatever you order, if it sounds good, it's going to be amazing. My wife and I have had the frog legs, the goat cheese relleno, the blackened streak salad (and added blackened shrimp to that), the big hippie, the fish and chips and the fries... JUST PLAIN AWESOME! If you partake in adult beverages, pair it all with Abita beers or the great selection of infused liquor. You will leave saying, \"when are we coming back? SOON!\"","806":"I had the fish and chips, and it was pretty amazing. The French fries almost outshined the fish - these were not standard frozen fries, but we're fried and seasoned just right. The fish was tender with a good flavor, and a good tartar sauce to top it off.\nThe decor was interesting with a bit of a Creole feel and local art.\nBy far, the standout was the staff. Everyone was overwhelmingly friendly and courteous. My server asked if I'd been here before and when I said no, she literally lightened up to tell me about it. A real nice find in a Tucson neighborhood.","807":"My partner and I have not stopped raving about this place since our visit two weeks ago. The decor is outrageously great, all thought of this place being pretentious flew out the window when we stepped through the door. The drinks were amazing, we tried the Libert\u00e9 and the Southside Sandia (both were great, but the Sandia was our favorite - it has a fun kick to it). You HAVE to try the bacon popcorn if you're going to do an appetizer, super yummy and different! Our entrees were amazing, I had The Parish Burger and it blew me away. My partner had The Smokin' Angel and I ate half his plate, he added sausage and boy was that the right choice. \n\nI've been bugging him to take me again for the past two weeks, and we're looking forward to round two!","808":"Nicely hidden in the dark corner of Orange Grove and Ina (Next Door to Sushi on Oracle). Great atmosphere with live music, we went in on a Saturday night at about 9 pm. \n\nBacon Popcorn? Interesting appetizer, but pretty good. I like my bacon extra crispy and that's what was mixed with the lightly buttered popcorn. I enjoyed it, but I would like to have it for breakfast with eggs and some French toast.\n\nThe Gumbo was delicious, great taste with some spice to it. Craw fish hush puppies were very fluffy and crispy at the same time. They had a hint of spice in the after taste. My burger was cooked just the way I ordered it and the fries were crispy, but not burnt. \n\nDessert special was a chocolate lava cake \u00e0 la mode and it was delightful. So stuffed from the above, but we had to finish every last bite of the dessert.\n\nI cannot wait to go back, food and service was awesome!","809":"Went back for happy hour.        Bartenders  meet us with smiles.     Great place to go after work.","810":"Unique place, great cocktails a little pricey but worth it. We really enjoy it there the few time we go.","811":"Stunningly beautiful setting, terrific service. Overrated and overpriced food, but that's expected. Get reservations.","812":"Unbelievably delicious food!! We met some friends here for dinner the other night and upon hearing where we were going I had to look up \"gastropub\". After reading some reviews on Yelp and reviewing the menu options, I was pretty interested to see what The Parish was going to be. It's in a little strip mall and the location is a bit hidden but make it a point to come try this place out. It's very heavily Louisiana\/Cajun\/Southern seafood with just a couple of choices that don't fit that if you don't like seafood. I had the Drunken Angel, which btw comes highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. It's pretty much angel hair pasta, soaked in burgundy wine (cuz who knew that was a thing!?), covered in a saffron lobster cream sauce with plenty of shrimp and crawfish....unf$@!ingbelievable!! Our table also had the gumbo, the Smokin' Angel, the Johnny Steak, the bacon popcorn, and the pork rinds. We ended up creating a small buffet and just sharing as the food is phenomenal here. Can't go on enough about how good the bacon popcorn is...they should box it up and sell it by the pound! The steak was perfectly cooked, smothered in a Johnny Walker cream sauce and the \"double fried\" fries that came with it were amazing. To top it all off, they've got a great beer selection...had a couple of some sort of coconut stout that was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back here for seconds!!","813":"I look at some of the reviews and I get the feeling that people have abnormally high expectations for this restaurant. \n\nAnyway, my parents and I went to Rats years ago... when I'm pretty sure most of these reviewers didn't even know it existed. We tended to get good seating and small complimentary dishes having mutual friends with the owner... Can't really comment on the food as of late since haven't been there recently, but I can assure you that if the food is anything close to what it was... this place surely beats the newly opened Agricola in Princeton.  Updated review to come.","814":"ok, so our office finally had the opportunity to dine at Rats. Due to my boss wanting to experience it, I swallowed and made the reservation-6months ahead..  The result was, as I sadly expected....much less than stellar. The food was just \"eh\". the wine just ok, the service - automated- the seats were way too close together and the room was crowded, loud and our meal was rushed even though we arrived for a late lunch -not a 7pm dinner! It was an extra insult to us when we were told we STILL had to pay to walk through the outdoor gardens and museum..(it was explained they no longer allowed free entrance, even for diners) After my boss generously spent several,SEVERAL dollars over the value of this experience, I could not accept that. We all left, feeling like we were ripped off. Not to ever go there again...Perhaps a business luncheon for all those in suits or being a regular must matter to the establishment. We were dressed business casual-it was, after all, our holiday meal together!  I have enjoyed much better meals elsewhere for much less snootiness...and I've dined in many fine restaurants...So, my review says, don't waste your time, money or expectations. I give it a huge \"poo-poo\".... Makes me wonder if any locals really go there at all...","815":"Have been here for Happy Hour a bunch of times as it was really close to work\n\nYou can sit outside in the summer or inside by the fireplace in the winter!\n\nGreat appetizers which change all the time!","816":"Decided to check this place out on the recommendation from some friends that had been there before. We sat at the bar and were welcomed by Stephanie. You quickly realize that they have a wall of in-house infused liquors. Their cocktail menu is loaded with specialty drinks using there very own infusions. The drinks were fantastic! Stephanie knew them inside and out and could explain and offer suggestions. Highly recommend trying one. I decided on the smoked pork chop and a friend had the Alabama quail. Both were cooked perfect and tasted fantastic. We finished the night with a shot of Pappy 15 year. Yes....they have Pappy. It was the end of a fantastic evening. Check it out.","817":"If I lived in Tucson, this would be my spot. Good help great music and killer food. Gumbo and hush puppies are as good as I ever had in NO. And the sazerac was the real deal too.","818":"Came here with my husband and were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance, quality of food, live entertainment, and affordability. They also had a huge selection of local or craft beer and sprits. We were not sure what to expect from a restaurant that requires reservations, but the atmosphere wasn't stuffy at all. The gumbo and the cheeseburger we ordered were both absolutely delicious and we plan to revisit soon.","819":"The goat cheese chili rellano is superb as is the gumbo.  Definitely have hush puppies.","820":"Great food and service!  We had a nice talk with the owner and it was clear great food was his passion. We eat here every time we are in town.","821":"The food our group had for lunch at Rats was good. The portions were small. The price was very high. I don't mind paying five-star prices for a five-star meal, but while I can't say anything bad about the food we ate at Rats, no one in our group had anything to rave about either.\n\nAll of us started with French Onion Soup which was good, if a little on the sweet side. I prefer it to be more savory, but that's purely a matter of taste.\n\nTwo in our group ordered omelets with smoked salmon for their main course. They both reported that the salmon was very tasty, but the omelet was not really special in any way. From my side of the table it looked like any decent omelet you might get in a New Jersey diner. For $12 the price wasn't bad. My wife and I both ordered wild boar with polenta. The boar was braised and shredded in a nice, savory sauce. We estimated that we got about three ounces, which was dolloped into a bowl of polenta with the consistency of cream-of-wheat. Again, it was tasty, but there was nothing unique about the boar - any distinctive flavor was completely lost in the rich sauce it was stewed in.  It could just as well have been beef pot roast, and at $22 for such a small portion the sauce wasn't the only thing that was rich!\n\nI ordered Apple Strudel for dessert, which was very sweet with a crystalized sugar crust - almost like a br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The golf-ball sized scoop of ice cream served with it had to be carefully portioned out to get a little ice cream with most bites. Once again, good, but not \"Wow! That was a dessert that was worth every bit of the $9 I paid for it!\"\n\nWith a beer and a cup of coffee my wife and I spent $88 for lunch, and got a pretty good $40 meal. \n\nThis is a beautifully decorated restaurant, and the service was excellent. And the food was good... just not all that special.","822":"Food: 4\nDecor: 5\nAmbiance: 5\nService: 5\nValue: 4\n\nIt must be noted that the service was well beyond anything we've ever experienced. Without going into detail, the staff, particularly the manager Allan, went well beyond our expectations in their accommodations. In addition to the beautiful setting, this service will definitely be responsible for our inevitable return. Thanks Again!","823":"Awesome food, great beer selection.  Pulled pork is great although it has seemed to get less spicy over time.  Crawfish hush puppies are fantastic.  They make some great mixed drinks too.","824":"Very nice setting and soft music playing. The pasta was delicious! My favorite entree. My husband ordered the NY strip and it was so tender and juicy. Will definitely dine there when we are back in Tucson!","825":"Great selection, wonderful flavor, beautiful presentation. We started with the bacon popcorn, which was amazing. I got the steak salad which was absolutely incredible, the fried blue cheese \"croutons\" were the best. Others got the hush puppies and the burger, all excellent. Our server was wonderful and was kind enough to send out my toddler's food first. Excellent liquor and beer selection, too!","826":"OMG! Fabulous gumbo, angel pasta lunch. Caught up with friends like we just saw each other yesterday instead of 7 years. Staff was superb; food was delicious and such a rare treat done right. Atmosphere was just right Southern casual but a bit of sophistication. Loved the art.","827":"Delicious pseudo Cajun\/ Creole fusion. The craft beers available blew us away. The service was very conscientious.","828":"Great local spot.  Live music, food is great, Bar is cool. The bartenders are always busy but make some awesome drinks.  This is q good place to hang out.","829":"We celebrated our 6 month anniversary here and are thinking about coming back for future special occasions! We're going on 1 year now. I loved this place and how memorable the experience was. The food and service are comparable to The Culinary Institute of America's restaurants (of which I'm an alum). They have an extraordinary wine list if I remember correctly.\nWe had the lobster bisque and french onion soup. Both were perfectly seasoned and savory. We also had the Mediterranean platter which required much restraint because I was shoveling food in my mouth at this point. They bring amuse bouche and popovers to the table! I had the lamb duo and my boyfriend had the chicken. The cannelini beans on my plate were slightly undercooked but that was the only issue with the entire meal. My boyfriend's chicken HAD to be brined for a few days because it was succulent, flavorful and perfectly roasted. You can tell by taste that they are indeed using organic young chickens. We had the donuts with the 3 sauces. I remember them being a little denser than I prefer. If I could change one thing I would probably want fluffier, yeastier donuts. The batter might have been overmixed before they were fried. We really liked the anglaise, jam, and chocolate sauce though. We also very much appreciated the complementary petit fours with our check! The staff ensured that our dining experience was above and beyond amazing and we are anticipating our next visit! \n\nWe went on the grounds late that night and were surprised to find the PEACOCKS ROAM FREELY AND GUARD THE MUSEUM. I was absolutely terrified. Imagine high pitched squawking and looking up into a tree to see a bird the size of a refrigerator.","830":"Went for the set menu which included a pass to the sculpture park. Food was very good but the service left a bad taste in our mouth. Service was very slow and we had to constantly remind our waitress about bread, water, etc. At 8.40, 2 and 1\/2hours after we arrived, our waitress brought wrist bands for the park. She then told us we had 20 minutes to see the park. We gulped down our dessert, passed on coffee or after dinner drinks , rushed to see the park, only to find it closed. We were ten told the last tour was 8.30. Asked to see a manager, waited and waited, asked again, waited and then a manager came to see us. Not the restaurant manager, but the catering manager. Told us we could come back for free. Big deal, we were visiting.","831":"Sat at the bar for dinner early on a Wednesday night. Cocktails and service were perfect from Loren. The food is a strange fusion, but admittedly so. Ate some frog legs, which is a sweet novelty in Tucson.\n\nThe staff accommodated our weird needs. The lighting is nice.","832":"The Parish earned 5 stars for their fabulous drinks, gumbo, and fish & chips.  The signature drinks were all refreshing, delicious, and attractive.  Beware, the tastiness of these treats masks the suprisingly high quantity of alcohol.  Cheers to the bartender, you are a giant among men!\n\nThe gumbo was tasty, full of flavor and an appropriate serving size.  It was a little salty, but I approve of heavy handed use of salt (or MSG). The hushpuppies were too dense, bland, and dry. I could have done with a slice of French bread instead.\n\nThe fish and chips were good, cooked well, but I'm just not a fish and chips kind of girl.  However, if fried, flakey, well-seasoned fish butters your bread, I encourage you to order this dish. \n\nI felt ambivalent toward the popcorn.  The idea sounded grand, but the flavor did not deliver.  The bacon was burned and there was not much of it, the pepper was lacking, and the green onions added nothing.  This dish ended up tasting like slightly burned buttered popcorn.\n\nAnother forgettable dish was the coleslaw.  The only taste it left on my tongue was bitterness.  Get the fries.\n\nNow for the detractors: frog's legs, both the shrimp and oyster po-boys, and the spicy Haitian shredded pork sandwich.  The frog's legs were chewy and masked by the heavy-handed use of bacon.  If there is one thing I hate more than any other foodie faux pa, its overusing bacon.  When I order frogs legs, I want to taste the natural sweetness of the meat.  This dish was overcooked and unimpressive.  (To be fair, the menu states that these are wrapped in bacon.  One of my companions ordered them.)\n\nThe shrimp po-boy lacked flavor, and the oysters in my friend's po-boy were raw.  She put on her game face and sucked it up, but she was distressed upon noticing the state of her shellfish. \n\nNow to the most disappointing dish, the spicy Haitian pork, for which I had such high hopes.  Why would any restaurant serve a dish this spicy?  Serving something this hot disqualifies 99.9% of the population from consuming 1\/10 of your main dishes.  What sort of economic logic is this?  It was flavored well, and the bun was delicious, but SERIOUSLY?!  Why?  Please tone down the heat so more of your customers can enjoy it. \n\nI like the ambiance at Parish, and I want to like the food more than I did.  I will definitely try it again, I'm curious about the lamb flatbread and the \"bacon and eggs.\"  Hopefully next visit I can give this locally owned establishment. \n\nOne more thing, please toss the neon art.  I'm no Leo Stein, but my visit was negatively impacted by huge bright faces staring at me while I ate\n.","833":"We had the five course prix fixe dinner along with wine pairing. \n\nAsparagus salad (not a fan), halibut, kobe steak, cheese platter, cheesecake. \n\nThe asparagus salad felt really boring. A bunch of greens (and that's all there was to it) mixed up together and that did not make a good salad. It needed some other color, some other flavor. Neither of us had more than 1\/4th of the salad. \n\nThe waiter was busy with larger party - so he did not notice until after 30 mins. \nBy that time, it was almost 50+ mins that we were seated at the table, and were only served a boring salad that nobody liked. So that was a big disappointment. \n\nFrom there on, food got better. Steak was rare and it was good. \nWine pairings were good. Waiter was pouring decent quantity. I believe he wanted us drunk so we wouldn't notice the food & service (or lack of) perhaps.\n\nService was slow. Timing was really poor. We had to wait a lot between each course and at one point I had to ask for a bread. (Get some decent food on this table already!)\n\nEach dish was served without any explanation (here you go sir, eat what's on plate. That looks like fish I guess). When we asked the server about the cheese, he had no clue what he served us. \n\nI am a fan of GFS and also a member at GFS. This was first visit to Rats. Not as impressed. \nHighly disappointed.","834":"The restaurants food is completely and totally delightful. Also the decor is absolutely amazing compared to many other restaurants in this area. \n\nThe service is rather leisurely and relaxed which I really don't prefer which is the reason for the four start rating. But other than that this restaurant is wonderful and I would request it to many others.","835":"Absolutely amazing place! Beautiful and upscale without being pretentious. Mixed drinks from the bar were delicious and well crafted. We walked around with our drinks and looked at the scenery around the restaurant before we sat to eat. The girls at the hostess stand were sweet and accommodating. My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 4 year anniversary and it was perfect. The octopus outdoes what I've eaten in Italy, the duck breast dinner was outstanding- perfectly cooked medium rare. My boyfriend ordered the mixed pork plate and he loved it. Espresso and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e were also outstanding. We were sad as each plate was finished because each was so delicious. Our waiter Josh was courteous and attentive and very knowledgable. This is absolutely one of the most enchanting and wonderful restaurants I've ever been to. Well worth every dollar and we can't wait to come back!","836":"Their menu is truly fun! Every dish is a little interesting and unique. It makes it nearly impossible to choose what to have. But don't worry-you can't go wrong! Whether it be the pork chop, the shrimp and grits, the steak, or even just a salad, everything is tasty, filling, and down-home cooking with a contemporary and elegant flair!  Try the corn bread with the butter milk and honey. A little bit goes a long way but it is quite tasty. I would say the only thing we were mildly disappointed with was the cast-iron skillet peach cobbler. It was a little too sweet and didn't have enough cake\/crumbly stuff. A little underwhelming. But that could also be because we were completely stuffed from our dinner. They have a great space for parties! A great table that seats eight is an a little separate area. You can call ahead and get it reserved if you have a larger group. Even though it's not completely closed off, we felt like we had our own little private dining area. The staff was incredible and the bartenders are spot on with their concoctions. It definite must if you're in the mood for some New Orleans style food","837":"I come here for the gumbo and hush puppies and cold beer.  My wife orders other stuff like a hamburger and other items on the menu.  She says it is all very good.  I can say the gumbo is very good and hush puppies are great with the gumbo. Tap beer offers nice range of beers.  Service is very good, not\n obtrusive but there when you need them.\n\nGreat neighborhood gastropub.","838":"EVERY single time we are there, it gets better and better!  Make reservations on weekends so you don't have to wait.  Tom was an amazing waiter. EXTREMELY attentive, and knew incredible details about each dish we inquired about - from sides to seasonings.  Shrimp and grits was to DIE for....Quail was out of this world, and Scallops were heavenly.  All after the bacon popcorn appetizer!  Love the host\/hostess, servers, owners milling around, just a GREAT atmosphere with incredible food and drinks.  Can't WAIT to go back!","839":"Great local place. Goat cheese relleno changed my life, seriously. So many great menu options including bacon popcorn! Drinks are really great too. Place is small, although they have recently expanded still have to get there early to get a table, not a bad problem to have though! This place is around the corner from me but I would travel across town to come here!","840":"After a solid, but not spectacular, dining experience at Rat's, I was really torn as to the number of stars I would give the restaurant.  The Grounds are obviously beautiful, and the food is sufficiently French, but the experience wasn't quite perfect.  First, if you love Disney-esque kitsch (and who doesn't), then the Wind in the Willows theme will be right up your alley.  If (relatively) obscure menu items (such as octopus) are your thing, then you will not be disappointed.  \n\nAs for the dinner, we dined on duck and the short ribs, and both were exceptionally well cooked.  Where we really ran into trouble was the \"souffle\" - and I use that term very loosely.  Because the ballyhooed Rat's souffle is really more of a brownie with some chocolate soup in the middle.  Since we split a dessert, I can't comment on the remainder of the dessert menu, but rest assured the souffle is not worth the roughly 10 minute wait.  \n\nAll in all, a nice experience, but a touch overpriced for the food Rat's serves.  Given the dearth of truly fine restaurants in the general Mercer County area, I'm sure we will be back.","841":"What I liked the most about RATS is the  unique  beautiful peaceful setting. Each room is beautiful and the outside pond and sculpture peaceful and lovely.  I only went there for lunch   - the selections were an interesting mix.  The food was good not excellent. I was not a fan of the onion soup, the special mushroom soup was much more interesting. The home made pasta was good but not outstanding. That being said - I did enjoy my meal. I found the surroundings special and soothing . Have to say , I had tried to make an earlier reservation and they were booked but when we went past at that time it was almost empty. That bothered me a bit. We easily got a table by walking in earlier.  I hate the name !\n\nJust went back service awful. Have to keep at 4 stars for setting but really 3 service and food!","842":"Rat's is one of the nicest restaurants I've ever been to. After a lovely afternoon at Grounds for Sculpture, we went for dinner at Rat's. I've been a few times, and every time it is perfect. We shared a salad and the tarte flambe-we're still talking about the tarte. We each got the foie gras burger-it was amazing, probably the best we've ever had. The cocktails were lovely, and the service was perfect.","843":"This was and is one of the best out of town places i have been to!! The food is amazing!!! Try the bacon wrapped frog legs!! Also the backyard burger made your way!! With lamb chorizo!! Goat cheese and tepin cheese and adobe pork!! Dam it was great!! And service was great!!!","844":"I can't rave enough about how awesome The Parish was tonight - another win for Yelpers (and my taste buds). The ambience was spot on, our server was great and most importantly the food was phenomenal. The Bacon Popcorn was fun and tasty, but the gumbo, BBQ pork sandwich and hush puppies were authentic and perfect. I'd like to see a few more beers on tap, but what they lack in draft selection, they make up for in an excellent mix of local and eclectic bottled beer. Bottom line: we'll be back (probably around Mardi Gras) and if you're anywhere near by you should get here too.","845":"my sis and I decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews and folks were right.  It was wonderful! We got recommendations from the waiter and he was spot on. We started with the bacon popcorn (OH YEAH) and had shrimp and grits (sister said it was to die for) and I had the drunken angel.  It was velvety and rich; flavorful.  I took part of it home to enjoy the next day. Great atmosphere, great drinks also.","846":"Love the \"CHEERS\"  everybody knows your name type feel you get when first walking in, but it seemed that you had to be a regular in order to get quality service.  I'll admit, they do have some unique, creative meals thrown together like the Bacon Popcorn and a good variety of items to choose from. We tried the Handcut Fries, which comes with an assortment of dipping sauce (wasn't to fond of, couldn't taste a difference), the Shrimp Po' Boy (basic ingredients but very tasty!) and the Gumbo (a little bland).  Overall the food was mediocre, if I lived a little closer I could see myself returning to visit the bar and maybe try the burgers.  They also do have a couple of flat screens setup around the bar to catch the game.","847":"This was my third or fourth visit; my wife's ninth or tenth. Previous visits left us somewhat unimpressed---we were there as much for the Grounds as for the restaurant anyway. But our dinner Saturday night was finally a match for the beauty of the setting.","848":"Two stars because the food is generally excellent, but service has really slipped and their desire to please customers has all but disappeared.\n\nRats Restaurant's reputation is a classy, professionally-served, expertly-prepared and deliciously-presented meals, with a great atmosphere. That is what I used to think too, until my latest experience at Rats clambake a few days ago. There were two seatings; one at 5:30 and one at 8:30, and reservations were suggested. That means that Rats should have known how many people were coming for the clambake, right? Apparently not. \n\nFirst, the good. The lobsters we had were cooked well, although the last one our party had was a bit overdone. The mussels were delicious, as were the shrimp. There was a terrific arugula and berry (blueberry) salad, coleslaw, potatoes, kielbasa, chicken, and corn cobs. \nThe corn was a bit soggy, and I didn't try the chicken; after all, the big sell was the seafood, and at $60 per person, I was hoping that the seafood would be great, and generally I was not disappointed. We arrived on time, and did not have to wait more than a moment or two to be seated. The server was prompt when we were seated, and we had our drink orders (beer and wine, not included in the fixed price) within short order. So far, so good!\n\nThe biggest problem is that within 10 minutes of sitting down and getting our plates, Rats ran out of clams. Their claim is that they did not know they didn't make enough. Don't worry, they said, we'll make mussels in the clam sauce (as if that is the same thing to a Rats diner!). When my wife went back out after her lobster, there was a small revolt in progress. The hostess never visited any of the disgruntled tables to try to make things right in any way. The server, who looked to be a high-school or college student (Rats used to have professional waitstaff) cleared the plates rapidly but never refilled water glasses or asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. Other dishes (including a blueberry cobbler) were not refilled either, causing diners to rush their meals for fear of not getting to try the dishes. The cobbler was tasty, but the other offerings included a strawberry shortcake with, I'm not kidding, ONE strawberry and a chocolate whoopie pie were dried out from refrigeration. \n\nThis experience followed a few visits for happy hour in which waitstaff were more interested in shooing the ducks away than taking drink orders, and arrogant bartenders would actually ignore us when we were at the bar. Needless to say, it seems that whoever is in charge is allowing the reputation to carry the load, but that reputation is sadly tarnished. The chef deserves better, and so do we; considering we paid (as a party of four) more than $300 with tip, we did not get our money's worth.","849":"We went to Rats on saturday night. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were given a gift certificate. \n\nWe started with appetizers. I had the pei mussels. She had the lobster crepe. We enjoyed both\n\nWe had cocktails. I was very disappointed in the sangria....not very fruity...mainly wine. If i wanted wine, i would have ordered wine \n\nThe first bread they brought out was hard and burnt. On returning it, the second was good. But we never should have gotten the first. \n\nShe had the filet mignon. I had the sirloin. The meat was good.  But, the vegetables were from barely warmed to cold....\n\nThe server was outstanding. She went out of her way to make our visit enjoyable. \n\nOverall. Fine....but the mistakes spoiled some of the night.","850":"Last Saturday, my bestie invited me and the other 6 girlfriends to Grounds for Sculpture to celebrate her 29 b- day and we had lunch at Rat's. \nAs soon as you stepped on the Japanese bridge, you pretty much got an idea the restaurant and the surrounding area were built based on Monet's famous of famous painting- the Water Lily Pond, the view on a sunny day is really really nice.    \nTh inside of restaurant is beautifully decorated, it is french country style theme with wooden beams on the ceiling and french country style chandelier. It's just very unique. \n\nWe were seated promptly upon our arrival, and after reading the menu, we decided that we were going to order 3 appetizers to share and ordered each our own's entrees. \nOur appetizers were Provencal Mezze, salmon tartine and baby kale salad, all of them were good. The hummus plate were really really good, it's huge portion and great for group to share, the artisanal flat bread came with the hummus dish is super delicious. The baby kale salad is fresh but small, I also noticed some of our friends who ordered seared trouts fro entrees did get kale salad on the side, so if you are going to order seared trouts, you probably don't need to order kale salad. \n\nI ordered vegetable risotto as entrees, I think it's OK, I am not too impressed. I tried a piece of the chicken that my friend ordered and it was very tender and juicy. \nI probably will order chicken or trout if I have ever visited this restaurant again since my friends seemed really like their foods.\n\nService is really good, our waiter Peter ( this is the name shown on the receipt) is superb, he constantly checked us see if our dishes were ok and was very curtious and professional. \n\nI took 1 star off because the desserts we ordered fell flat. For a dessert plate that is charged for $9+ , I really think they can do better.","851":"Our first time here for lunch. Delicious! Fish and chips were perfect! Fish was crunchy on the outside, moist, tender and cooked to perfection on the inside. The Parish Burger had a great grilled flavor. The fries were seasoned just right. The gumbo was spicy and tasty. Widely varied craft beer menu, too.","852":"Brought a group of clients to the restaurant for a business lunch. Ordered a salad and bit down on a shard of glass. I kept quiet until the end of everyone's meal because I didn't want to make a scene in front of clients - but when I brought it to the manager's attention, he took it to the kitchen and came back and explained to me that it was not glass but a piece of plastic. No apology. I then explained that it was indeed glass since I had it in my mouth. Again, no apology. It was unbelievable.","853":"The restaurant and grounds are just beautiful! Went for Sunday brunch and the service was excellent. The buffet was wonderful. One in our party ordered Eggs Benedict, and she felt it was just so-so, she expected better. The other 2 entrees exceeded our expectations. We loved the sculpture gardens and landscaping. Can't wait to return. I agree with the review that called Rat's an \"adult fairy tale.\"","854":"Food and server was excellent. Small enough that reservations are advised. Menu is unique and portions are generous. We will return.","855":"Every experience here has been fantastic. We order something different every time and have never been disappointed. The mixed drinks are special and delicious. Always look forward to going here.","856":"Ugh, so good! I am not from the South, and I know very little about Cajun\/Creole cuisine. But I can say everything we had from the Parish was delicious.\n\nNeeded somewhere with top quality food but a laid-back ambiance to celebrate our anniversary. The Parish was the perfect place for us. Their cocktail menu was creative - I got some peach-infused deliciousness. Started with the crawfish hushpuppies which, as the menu promises, were \"deep fried perfection\". Also ordered the cornbread, most of which we took home and ate for dessert on subsequent nights. Crunchy on the outside, warm and sweet on the inside!\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Drunken Angel and the Steak & Frites - wow!!!! Both were extremely flavorful. For the Drunken Angel, I really can't describe the flavors because I've never had anything like it before but suffice it to say that it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Savory, lots of seafood, with a hint of sweetness. Rich creamy sauce. The sauce on the Steak really made it, and it was perfectly cooked inside.\n\nWe definitely spent a lot that night, but given the portion size and sheer quality of food, I don't think the prices are unreasonable. I also appreciate that they have cheaper sandwich-type options like pulled pork, etc if you just want to go for a non-special occasion.\n\nFinally, do *not* come here if you are on a diet! You will want to order everything, and walk away with days and days of leftovers like we did. The food is all pretty heavy, so go when you're in the mood to be a glutton, and walk away proud of yourself for eating a lot (or with a workout plan for the week, like me)!","857":"This place was ok.  Not bad, but not a place I would need to go again.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The atmosphere was casual and inviting.  The food and drinks... is why I gave it 3 stars.  I wasn't impressed with the food.  It was edible, but nothing I'd write home about.","858":"Rats\nI have long heard about Rats and was thrilled to finally have an opportunity to dine here!  What a delightful treat that it is.  The setting is based on pure whimsey and is inspired by the setting of the Frog and Toad forever series of books which I loved as a child.  With so many beautiful sculptures around and situated on a lake with Monet-esque waterlillies it is hard to imagine a more picturesque setting.  We were fortunate enough to be able to spend time in the Moroccan area of the restaurant and were served speciality drinks as we were reclining on a variety of brightly colored pillows.  The menu is inventive with the majority of the ingredients coming from locally grown farms.  The waitstaff was very accommodating and friendly. The food is wonderful.  It is pricey and hard to get a table often times but after being there I totally understand why.  It is simply one of my favorite places and I can not wait to go back.","859":"The name comes from the book The Wind in the Willows, after the gregarious party-savvy Rat character.  This beautiful intimate place was busy at happy hour and is wonderful for a romantic date, but get there early if you want a table outside.  \n\nRat's is perched on the edge of the Grounds For Sculpture museum and was created by the museum's benefactor, Seward Johnson, grandson of the Johnson & Johnson founders (though he was fired from his company job there).  If it is not his eye for beauty and design at work here, he certainly knows how to hire the right people.  He is still alive and comes to hang out on the museum grounds sometimes.\n\nThere is nothing for vegans on the regular menu, but at happy hour, we scored $2 snack dishes of olives, eggplant caponata, and hummus.  They offer creative classic drinks and a nice wine list -- and glasses of wine are around $5 between 4-7 weekdays.  \n\nWe sat outside by the misty (smoke machine effect) Monet bridge, one of the most gorgeous scenes ever because the point is to make you feel you are in that famous painting. The waiters try unsuccessfully to shoo away the ducks that enthusiastically patrol the porch -- because customers have trained them to beg for scraps.  Just bring some bug spray if you have any bare skin showing, because the biters will be out in force when there is water around. \n\nWe saw a bride and groom having pictures taken on the bridge and no wonder, what a setting.","860":"Had a lovely lunch here yesterday, after suffering in the veritable food desert that is Hamilton.\n\nAlthough it's on the property of Grounds for Sculpture, you don't have to go into the park to eat here. \n\nThe food was fresh, local when possible, and really delicious! The lunch selections were varied and reasonably priced. We both had the moule et frites and the broth was especially nice, with just a hint of saffron, but a goodly amount of butter and shallot. Yay. \n\nSmall but good selection of wine by the glass. Mostly local beers on tap. \nService was great. \nAmbiance is really wonderful. On a nice day, sit outside. We looked over the \"Monet bridge.\" \n\nDessert looked interesting, but we didn't order it.\n\nI would very much enjoy eating here again. Maybe today, if I hadn't returned home more than 1000 miles away.","861":"4 stars because they have Dixie beer and Basil Hayden's bourbon. respect because the owners are apparently from New Orleans so kudos to that. \n\ni'm just here for drinks, which are iced down Buds. plus. food that's coming out smells great but i'm only waiting to eat next door. the bartender is cute and super nice.  i'd come back if i had the time. give these guys a chance.","862":"I am sitting at The Parish and i have hardly ever experienced such great customer service. Being that i am from Central Louisiana, I am used to 'friendly folk'. After sharing with my server that i have an allergy to alcohol, he went above and beyond to cater to my needs. Thank you for your wonderful attitude and friendly smile. Made my date night that much better!!","863":"All-around great deep south fare! The drunken sailor is an awesome Cajun shrimp pasta dish.","864":"We went to Parish on Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was wonderful!  Their gumbo is spot on and delicious.  They actually know how to make one.  It can be hard to find a decent gumbo outside of NOLA.  The service was superb and the bathrooms were very clean and tidy.  We will be back to try some more of the items on their menu.","865":"The fish and chips were so fresh and good . We sat at the bar and it was out quick and hot ! Great service and the drinks were yummm!","866":"Outstanding!  The shrimp and grits are some of the best I have ever had!  Bloody Mary's rock!","867":"First visit and we went for lunch prior to a visit to Grounds for Sculpture. LOVED IT.  The restaurant itself is beautiful. Service was excellent. We had the french onion soup and the special appetizer -- fig and pancetta flatbread. Excellent. Lunch was the homemade pastrami sandwich and the croque madam -  again - excellent. Beautiful restaurant, great service, great food.","868":"Great food. Super nice staff. Yelped this for a place to eat while in town for work. Would come back in a heart beat. Love country music tonight too is an added bonus.","869":"First time here went with my cousin and daughter who moved around the corner. Found it on Yelp once again Yelp has never failed me. This place is great for southern cuisine with a kick. From the Bacon Popcorn, salmon salad, pecan smoked trout, broiled peanuts and Southside Sandia (speciality drink) this is the closest to Louisiana your going to find. Portions are large and the presentation of the food is outstanding. This prices are high for a college town but being close to Oro Valley.","870":"Four of us signed up for the Russian Dinner on Jan 21st at 8pm. Our table was not ready for 20 minutes, resulting in $40 of drinks while waiting. The wine pairings were outstanding and the infused vodkas excellent. The three different, tiny portions of caviar were interesting. Next came an uninteresting veal\/mushroom consomm\u00e9. Not a good choice for this dinner. The three entries were disappointing. The beef stroganoff featured a huge chunk of overcooked, stringy braised beef with not much flavor, rather than a much more tasty recipe like Julia Child's (p 325) of small pieces mixed with mushrooms in a more flavorful sauce. Second entree was salmon Kulebiaka which also was overcooked and lacked flavor. The third choice was chicken Kiev - better but a heavy crust on the outside. This is not the chef that made Rats famous. But two thumbs up for the dessert chef - a perfect, flavorful warm apply strudel encased in a delicate, flaky envelope. In sum, a mixed experience and review.  I would come back for drinks and desserts.","871":"Its Friday night, dinner with a friend!  Yay!!\n\nIt was a 30-35 minute wait when I arrived at 7.  Waited for my friend to arrive and we ordered cocktails from the full bar...  I am not sure how long the wait was, but I didn't finish my cocktail before we were seated.  I had the Dirty Well Water.  It is good.  I am on a gin kick lately and it hit the spot.\n\nWe started with the frog legs.  They were not bad, but almost too much bacon! Say What!!  Yeah, I know, I said it.  Almost too much bacon.  It was wrapped around the leg, and ended up kind of coming off when you went to eat and\/or dip in the sauce.  It was good, but I think I like the hush puppies better (had on a previous better).  The sauce it came with was very good.\n\nTonight I went with the mesquite salmon salad.  The salad was a very good size, the candied pecans were very tasty, and the mesquite salmon was good too.  But here is my problem.  The salmon came already pulled apart and mixed in the salad.  I wish it had been served whole on top of the salad.  That is my one complaint.  The dressing was sweet and was actually barely needed.  And they served it on the side without asking!  THANK YOU!\n\nThe service overall was fantastic.  Our waitress was attentive, and our water was always full, as well as our cocktails.  The manager came by to check on us, and all went well.\n\nA very good evening... I'll be back again...","872":"Definitely not a 5 star restaurant. I was really looking forward to this place since there were such great reviews, but it was definitely not what I hoped for. Service was mediocre, and the food was meh. My dad's burger was raw in the middle and he had to send it back twice before the burger was actually cooked correctly. Worst part was they charged us twice for the burger because they had to remake it. definitely won't be going back. Not worth the money or the time.","873":"It was delightful!  We started with an infused basil vodka martini and atop shelf margarita! The hush puppies as a starter came with a spicy\/ sweet sauce, that made the bit of Crawfish in them explode! We followed with Fish and Fries, flaky and nice breading. My angel hair with shrimp crawfish lobster in a light cream base tomato sherry shallot sauce was the best I've had outside of New York or New Orleans.  Try this place!","874":"I've had Cajun food before but this is hands down some of the best.   Couple of us had the cornbread which was good but we preferred a more savory kind like a jalapeno cornbread Parish cornbread tastes like a Graham cracker which isn't bad. \nCrawfish hush puppies were good but needed a more crawfish taste if crawfish is in the description.\nShrimp and grits with the side of greens all outstanding.   Drunken angel hair pasta with that bread it came with outstanding again.   Service was good and we will be back.  We were bummed po boys weren't an option for dinner.   Beignets would be great too.  Thank you","875":"Inattentive lazy service + bad food = Rat's fail\n\nLocation is gorgeous and stunning, the grounds are lovely and interesting. The day was warm, the patio inviting, with very few tables at this point, maybe 4 were filled. The patio has a wonderful view and is well shaded.\n\nDrinks are a high point, very well-mixed and spectacular.\n\nI spent the two + hours feeling upset for my host, who had been so excited about the reservation and was clearly pained by the experience we were all having.\n\nWe were seated promptly and we ordered water. It took about 25 minutes to get water. We had ZERO idea where our server was disappearing to the whole time but he was absent. It was completely bizarre. Was he also leading tours thru the garden? Was he handblowing glassware in the back for the dinner service? \n\nWhen he did *magically* appear, he'd hover, and upon his realization we were missing things we had ordered\/requested  (water, drinks, food, etc), he would look like a deer in headlights and run off again, but not to actually accomplish anything. Fascinating. Or he'd say something like 'I can't believe that hasn't come out yet!' while hiccuping.\n\nHe dropped a plate on one of the guests. \nHe forgot a salad and blamed the kitchen.\nHe forgot to put the temp in for the burgers and they all came out well done instead of medium rare. \nHe forgot multiple drinks and made excuses. \nHe forgot to refill our waters on a 90 degree day\nHe forgot to take the empty glasses off of our table so by the end our table was cluttered.\nHe forgot to clear all the appetizer plates when the entrees came or after we were finished. (we actually piled the plates up ourselves to make some room, he still didn't get the hint).\nHe gave a 3 year old child ice cream on a tiny plate the size of a saucer and her lemonade in a tall beer glass. Ever see a toddler try to get ice cream off a plate with a giant spoon? That's a great idea. Were they out of bowls? \n\nThe food was also very sad. Not a single person at my table finished even a decent sized portion of their appetizer or entree. Burgers completely overdone and the appetizers were oversalted. The mezze plate was decent but the lavash was stale and chewy. He seemed surprised we didn't eat more, saying something like 'if you are going to write a Yelp review, please make it positive since my manager takes them really seriously.' NO.WORDS.\n\nDessert? no thanks.\n\nAt the end of the meal, he came over to bring the check and said something like 'I hope you've enjoyed the food, and most of all the service.'  \n\nWe just wanted to leave. On the way out I had to ask two waiters texting on their cell phones to move from the doorway so I could exit the patio. I stood there for a moment and then I had to VERBALLY ask them since they were looking down at their phones.\n\nWOOF. I was so disappointed with our experience after hearing so many positive things but clearly they had their B team on schedule. We travelled far and wide, and next time we'll pack a lunch.","876":"The atmosphere is funky, but the food is fabulous. I had their gumbo, and it was the best I have had in Tucson. It is truly a bit of New Orleans.","877":"The gumbo is awesome sauce!  And their happy hour is a lot of fun.  Don't forget about the magic show.","878":"Wow! \nthat is what i have to say about this fun place.\nOn a recent trip to the tucson area, looking for a good place to eat, we read yelp \nreviews for this restaurant and decided to give it a try.\nAt first concerned about the reports of a crowded establishment, we decided to try it anyway. Pleasantly we did not have to wait and our service was great by a very welcoming Leezly. We opted for the appetizer of Bacon popcorn, which in my eyes is a must.\nNext the parish burger- a burgers topped with bleu cheese, bacon, red onion marmalade, Dijon mustard . Definately a great decision.\nFor dessert, we werre talked into a  chocolate covered peanut butter cheesecake made with bacon crust.... sense a theme?  Leezly also was great at recommmending fabulous tap beers to suit our palate(s).\n\nBy all means take the time to stop and sample the quisine. We ate on A MOnday night around 5:30 pm","879":"I really liked the atmosphere here but service was a bit slow. We were visiting from out of town so I chose the Parish. We started out with a bowl of boiled peanuts seasoned with Cajun spice. Very unique I must say. Totally different from your roasted peanuts in the shell. I'd encourage others to try this unique verdin of an American favorite. \n\nMy dinner included the best collard green dish I have ever had. Plenty of mixins including some BBQ pork. Served with wonderfully sauced shrimp and grits. This is a must try combination.","880":"Service is decent. Last time I went it was with a large group and it started to get stuffy but they promptly turned down the AC when asked. Pretzels were very dense and too chewy. Chile relleno was good but not substantial, a bit overpriced. Also had the burger a few times which is pretty good, but definitely not the best burger in town.","881":"What a great place! Stopped in for dinner and was glad i did.  I had the parish burger and wow, it was out of this world! It was literally that good.  My friend had the Drunken Angel pasta that she couldn't stop raving about.  We both got a side salad which was huge. Try the lemon vinaigarette with blue cheese on the salad,  it was excellent.  John was our server and he was top notch.\n\nAll in all great meal, great evening.  Thanks Parish Tucson!","882":"Easily the best Happy Hour around.  I was able to try a lot of the noshes since I went with a  group and we were all hungry! We ordered the bacon popcorn, PEI mussels (comes with bread with this gorgeous creole butter or something crazy-sinfully delicious whatever it was!), gumbo, oysters, pimpanadas and also tried the bacon wrapped frogs legs.  The mussels, gumbo and pimpanadas were my favorites.   Bacon popcorn was good but what's not to love?  Wish I was able to have some dessert, but left feeling full and satisfied.  While, I'm not a beer drinker, my companions were impressed with ales on tap.  I opted for signature cocktail and can recommend the Sam Clemens.","883":"Atmosphere and service is 5 star. Taste of food is two star. I had lamb and my wife had salmon. Taste of both were sub par. Cheese appetizer was very good. If the food were good, this would be a five star restaurant in the middle of nowhere.","884":"After a long week at work, we met a bunch of friends for the Grand Opening. This place was awesome. Great food, great atmosphere. I'm only in town for a few weeks, but I plan to come back!","885":"Had a great lunch. Everything cooked perfectly. Shrimp and cabbage salad perfectly dressed and delicious. Hanger steak tasted terrific and was like butta. French fries homemade and made right. Apart from the stupid name, this place is absolutely wonderful.","886":"We went here looking to try something different and that certainly happened. While the frog legs and burger were tasty, everything else we ate was just too salty. Four of us shared what we got and we all agreed on the salt content, so it wasn't just a one off situation. I would maybe try it once more if I'm in town again, but it won't be my first suggestion.","887":"Seems expensive for the portion size. The NOLA food I had was red beans & rice, gumbo, crawfish etoufee, catfish and hush puppies. If you want authentic this wasn't it. If you want a variation of these items then ok. Gumbo is always served with rice as is etoufee. For some reason the 50 cents worth of rice wasn't served in the portion I had. It was a sampler plate. The catfish had a crispy coating but the fish was mushy. Red beans typically has sausage but this had shredded something.  Wasn't impressed.  However, I will say the 3 oysters I had that cost $7 were very good with the smoked tomato concoction and the goat cheese Chile relleno was quite good as well. I,very heard the regular fish & chips they serve is good but am reluctant after the catfish. Sometimes it's better to just go with what's been successful in NOLA.","888":"Our group went for Happy Hour last night and Tom was our Server - He was very pleasant and accommodating and followed up with service. Since we were celebrating three birthdays they provided Bread Pudding desserts for the Birthday people unsolicited - Thanks that was a classy touch!!!","889":"I don't know why people gave this place such poor reviews but I loved it! It's kinda in the middle of nowhere as it could be a bit hard to find. But when u drive in thru the gate and u will see the lovely, French country-style building. \nWe went there for my birthday and make an appointment for 8:30pm. Since it's summer now it's usually bright outside till pretty late. So we arrived a bit early and walked around Grounds for Sculpture (the sculpture land attached to the restaurant but has separate admission) for about 30 min - a pleasant thing to do before dinner on a nice summer night. \n\nBoth interior and exterior of the restaurant are very pretty. I feel like I was back in Monet's Giverny garden as I was walking in the back yard. And you can tell that all the wood pieces and dinner plates (they each have a famous french painting on them!) are carefully selected. Very nice ambience but not intimidating at all.\n\nFor food, we got the foie gras and escargot for appetizers cuz those are two of my to-go dishes for french food and I definitely wanna try theirs out too. I think the foie gras is really delicious with the raspberry (?) sauce and the escargot was also good, but could be better.\nWe also got lamb, duck breast, halibut, and short ribs for entree as we had four ppl. I liked my lamb a lot especially with the sweet pea sauce. All the dishes were very tasty, just depends on what you prefer. \n\nMy mom told them it was my birthday so when we ordered desserts, they wrote happy birthday on them with chocolate, which I appreciate cuz I wouldn't want them to embarrass me by singing some wacko version of the birthday song...The waiter was really nice and welcoming too! I don't understand why people said they're snobby cuz every person in there was really nice.\n\nAnyways, it was an amazing experience with all factors combined so I think they definitely deserve a 5-star! I also recommended it to my friend who's going on a date - definitely a catch for restaurant dates ;)","890":"I was with my wife and three kids coming back to Tucson from Biosphere 2 and we lucked into this place.  The kids and my wife had burgers and they all raved. I had the war pig and despite not knowing what to do with the pork rinds, I happily gobbled it down.  So much better than any of the chain places you could go to on the way into Tucson.  Thanks","891":"Best fish and chips in town! This bar\/restaurant is what you would expect to find in a downtown or live\/work entertainment district...not in a strip mall on Oracle and Orange Grove. The drink list is amazing and it's enjoyable watching the bartenders do their magic. All of our food arrived in a timely manner and there were no complaints about the entire experience. We'll be back!","892":"Great view .. Food really yummy . Diff textures and pairings are fabulous . Cheese plate .. Mussels .. Braised rib is ridiculous . Enjoy & sip a gin pinmm something","893":"I was quite disappointed in our experience at this well known restaurant. A few friends and I decided to go for the Dinner and a stroll pre fix deal. Once our waiter knew we were doing the pre fix menu he had absolutely no interest or time for us. The food was actually delicious but the service was ridiculously pompous and he made us feel like we had no business being there. Once our meal was done we went for our \"stroll\" through the Grounds for Sculpture. The women at the gate to let us in was so rude. They close at 9 and we entered at 8:25. She said we have 10 minutes to get back before she locked the gait because \"she had to get home\". We thought she was kidding!!! We get back to the gait at 8:55 and low and behold....gait locked with a chain!!!!! We had to hop the fence in our dressed to get out!!!! We go in to the bar thinking maybe they would comp us a drink considering we spent $80 per person for our meal and we were met with another pompous, uninterested staff member who made us feel like he didn't have time for us. We will never go back after that experience!! They need new staff asap!!!","894":"I went to Rats with my wife for a fancy weeknight dinner. It's a beautiful restaurant that made me feel like I was somewhere on the French countryside. I had the Monk fish special which was really good but I was still hungry once my plate was clean. My wife had the duck which was pretty good. We ordered an over priced bottle of wine that ended up having sugar crystals in it. We WERE charged for it anyway. This place is pretentious. Come on, its called Rats! The portions are really small and the prices are high. Also, there were only a few people dining that night however a couple that came in right after us was seated next to us and since the tables were only about two feet apart it was impossible to have a private conversation. Oh and Dress nicely, My Buddy Bob D. (see his reviews) wouldn't be allowed in, I hope!","895":"OMGawd!! I've been coming to Tucson from\nLA for over 20 years & just struck freakin' Gold!!! The Parish is off the Chain y'all!! My husband & I had the Best Shrimp & Grits...Ever, Period!  The fruit infused drinks are Amazing & the Gumbo & Cornbread blew me away! My husband is hooked on on their Bacon Popcorn appetizer. If you love Popcorn & Bacon, you better get some of this stuff - Amazing!! Authentic Cajun food with a modern twist!","896":"Absolutely Wonderful!  Enchanting setting, charming decor, attentive and professional hosts and servers, and fresh, aromatic, delicious food.  The staff paid attention to detail from start to finish.  The herb chicken smelled heavenly, and the taste was amazing.  We can't wait to go back!","897":"3 of us stopped for lunch today. It's worth a visit!\n\nI had the Parish burger with a cup of gumbo. The gumbo had a smoky flavor to it and it was great. The burger was cooked as asked, served with crispy bacon saut\u00e9ed red onions dijon mustard on a really good bun. Excellent, excellent burger, I'd put it easily in the top 10 burgers in Tucson and maybe the top 5. It's a Destination spot for burgers! DDD needs to investigate this place!!!\n\nMy wife and daughter tried the Pulled pork with a side salad. Pulled pork was served on the same great bun had a sweet bbq sauce and an aioli sauce with a bit of heat. Nice! My wife said it was the best she has ever had!  Again, they slapped this one outta the park! Where the hell is Guy Fieri and DDD? He need to check this place out!\nThe salad was a nice mix on greens and had a lemon blue cheese dressing. Creative and delish!\n\nI'll be back! Can't wait to do dinner here! Great place!","898":"I used to love rats- artsy decor but the food was inedible. Both me and husband had seemed to be reheated microwaved fish- he actually sent his back- how do you mess up salmon!? Come on now.. my friends went to dinner that same night had totally different items off the menu and also had the same experience and told me they wouldn't be back.  Listen, rats is pricey so the food should be high quality and reflective of that. I hate leaving this review bc I did love it so but come on.. go to the Gray Stone in Newtown.. it's amazing and won't disappoint","899":"I've had 2 good meals there in the last 4 years but this last one was a disappointment. \n-the manager on duty 3\/4\/17 does not seem to care much about her customers. Kind of sleep walking through the discussion of why we needed to move from the table right next to the back patio exit. People were going in and out and it was 20 degrees out. If you're that bored or disinterested with the job maybe it's time to let someone who cares do it. \n-the shrimp was over cooked\n-the scallops were, too, and a bit fishy\nI wonder if my Entr\u00e9e was left under the warning lights.\n\nStill a nice atmosphere and a good bar crowd.  But at $35 an Entr\u00e9e it needs to be prepared more carefully.","900":"Great Fish entr\u00e9e. loved every bite. the bartender Lauren was helpful in making us something we have never had. What a treat. 6 drinks later we said this was the best birthday ever.\nLove the food,love the drinks and the people who work there are so pleasant.\nIt didn't break the bank,go at Happy Hour.","901":"What a find! The quail was tender, crispy and tasty. The fish and chips had great french fries, fish was average. The Ahumado  Fresca is The Drink!!! Dont try anything until u try this. Smokey, sweet, tangy! Stop in, support local!","902":"Had a wonderful experience at the Parish last week. This was my first time there and I would definitely return. The atmosphere of this restaurant is nothing like anything else I have experienced in Tucson. Perfect for a low-key date night. \n\nThe food was beyond delicious. I ordered the \"Dark Angel\" and the cornbread to start. Both I would highly recommend. \n\nThey have a large selection of unique hand crafted cocktails. I ordered the \"Front Porch\", it was light and not too sweet! \n\nCan't wait to return to the Parish for a second visit!","903":"We tried this place as an after dinner drinks spot. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, but the service was great. The waitress was very nice and gave great suggestions. I had the house made blueberry infused vodka, which was amazing! Great prices too! My friends enjoyed the bacon popcorn and pork rinds. Unfortunately the power went out a couple of times and the live music was a little distracting. Also, there was a man smoking right inside the door for part of the night. The food and drinks were good, but had to dock a couple stars for the ambience.","904":"The food was ok but the service was horrible. Had to flag our waitress down 3 times and didn't even get the free dessert for the kids because we would have been there for another 10 hours. Not worth it!!","905":"The Parish is such a fun date spot.\nMy wife and I came here during our Babymoon in Tucson and really enjoyed ourselves.\n\nThe Bacon Popcorn was tasty, but, as surprising as this might be, not the healthiest treat.  :-)\n\nMy wife got the Parish Burger and I got the Drunken Angel.  Both were great entrees.\n\nOur server was incredibly helpful, and there was fun live music, too.\n\nAll around - a great time.  \nWhether you live in Tucson or are just visiting like we were, definitely check it out.\n\nENJOY!","906":"Went here for lunch a few weeks ago after visiting the grounds for sculpture. We had a lovely seat outside with a great view of the Lilly pond. I had a great time, the waiter was attentive, food was decent. The menu did seem a little limited wines it came to veggitarian options other than salad. Surprisingly their beer prices weren't as outrageous as I imagined them to be.","907":"During our weekend in Tucson with my husband, we were looking for a nice place to have dinner. We were staying in a resort outside of Downtown and we really didn't want to drive 25 minutes just to have dinner in Downtown. So we looked on Yelp and came across The Parish. What a hidden gem! \nWe were so surprised and excited to see that they had frog legs on the menu! We ordered a bottle of Malbec and 5 appetizers, we wanted to try everything!\nFirst, we started with the Crawfish Hushpuppies - they were good, however I could not taste the crawfish that much, the corn bread was overpowering. \nSecond, we ordered the Hot Legs Le'Jean (frog legs). It was delicious! We haven't had frog legs in a very long time!! You should definitely try it!\nThen, we had the BBQ Tails (pigs tails). It was actually our first time trying pigs tails, I was quite reluctant at first however it was very tasty! Even the fat was good!\nThen, to Brian's recommendation (our server) we ordered the Goat Cheese Relenno, which was my favorite by far! So much flavor to it! \nWe then finish with the Bacon PopCorn which is their most popular item, we had to try it! It was quite good!\nOverall, our experience at The Parish was amazing, if you want to try uncommon food, come check it out!","908":"I honestly don't remember what we ordered as meals. What I DO remember and will crave forever was the bacon popcorn! My only suggestion is to make sure you eat it warm because once it cools off you can REALLY see how truly unhealthy it is. I will definitely get it again the next time I'm in the area. :-)","909":"My boss loves this place and I can agree. We got lucky and had the private room and our server was pretty amazing at helping us out. The downside was that he also seemed to have other tables, so sometimes service seemed a little slow, but that was not his fault. By the end of the meal when the place slowed down, we seemed to have more service for drinks. \n\nI had the pulled pork, which was pretty good. I'm always partial to pulled pork and while the flavors were nice, it did lack any garnish. The rest of the table had hamburgers, which all looked pretty amazing. I would have given this place another star if there was a little more punch to my meal, but I would for sure try this place again.","910":"Gorgeous location with good food, and great ambiance!\n\nThe service was really good, and the recommendations by the gentleman who waited on our table was on point with the food and drinks :)","911":"Stopped by rat's yesterday, after I was craving it for years to try the restaurant. I was quite disappointed. The restaurant is promoted as upscale French bistro but I would say that the food was not as high quality as I was expected. We shared Brie Tartlet which was OK but not fabulous, didn't taste the two little chunks of brie :) much. Overall was an interesting combination of the sweet marmalade and bacon. For entree we had Rabbit Rague, it came with cold noodles totally lack of flavor, sauce had few little chunks of carrot. As my opinion rabbit would go much better with mashed potatoes. I wish sauce had more veggies and more spices. We also had the pastrami sandwich which tasted much more flavorful. I didn't want to try any of the desserts after the entrees disappointment. The service was good and attentive, overall ambiance nice and romantic by the lake, but as I said food was not great and corresponding the prices.","912":"Food was delicious. I recommend the fish and chips. The outside was nice and crispy and the fish was.perfectly cooked.","913":"Ate at the Chef's table, aka The Rat Hole two nights ago: Emily C. the catering manager helped me plan an exquisite evening.  The service, food, wine, and  scotch were all incredible!  Cocktails and hors' d'oeuvres on the patio were a perfect start prior to being escorted to \"The Rat Hole\" with my 6 guests...escargot, steak tartar w\/quail egg, pork belly pate, fois gras, hangar steak, fried oysters, lamb chops, scallops, etc.  A deliciously masterful evening. The only thing missing is valet parking.","914":"We had a wonderful lunch. My husband ordered the frog leg appetizer and loved it. The bacon wrap and spices added a great flavor and they were tender and juicy. I ordered the shrimp poor boy. It was great with large shrimp breaded in cornmeal. My husband had the drunken angel. It was deliciously rich with large shrimp and crawfish. Our server, Amber, was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. The decor is reminiscent of a a small New Orleans cafe. Perfect for a relaxing lunch or dinner.","915":"Pricey but the best sangria around!  Food is so tasty and different than average places in area.  A treat but worth it","916":"Came here for dinner with a group of colleagues and wanted to try this based on the reviews and the publicity of the restaurant. Nice vibe to the restaurant. We had a 30 min wait time on a Thursday evening. It wasn't a bad of a wait but reserve on Yelp in advance to save yourself some time!! You're welcome \n\nFor starters, we went with the pigtails and the crawfish hush puppies. The hush puppies were awesome and per my colleagues the pig tails, they were so good! Don't be afraid to try them. For main course, I went with the drunken angel dish because it is all over YELP.  This is everything you'd want in a dish from portion size to flavor to the saffron base to the garlic bread!! Phenomenal!\n\nThe service was good. The waitress tried and tried and I am know she did her best. She was responsible for an entire section and unfortunately that may have slowed her down. She did a fantastic job servicing us but I think the restaurant must have more than one person overlooking an #IronChefTucson Winner.\n\nI didn't love the fact that 70% of the menu is pork base. If you don't  eat pork, the food is already prepped with bacon \/ sausage and can't be removed. On the other hand, if you love pork this is your spot. \n\nFood 5\/5\nService 4\/5 \nRestaurant management 3\/5\nMenu options 3\/5\nAtmosphere 5\/5","917":"Great food and good beer selection. Had the gumbo and hush puppies. Best hush puppies I've ever had. Gumbo is incredibly flavorful and with a bit of Louisiana hot sauce was a great dish. Not used to having basil leaves in gumbo, but it really gave it some good flavor.","918":"Delicious gumbo, hush puppies are good, but are a bit dark, would be better and more appetizing if they were golden brown. Jambalaya and red beans and rice need to be added to menu. Cute nice decorated quaint restaurant, peach whisky drink is yummy.","919":"First time to visit and it has now become one of my fave restaurants in Tucson. I ordered Drunken Angel and loved it. I'll probably be back just to try it again!","920":"I came here with my husband for his birthday and the food was delicious.  I enjoyed the food so much.  The grilled octopus was the best appetizer I ever had.  The shrimp was also amazing.  The creme Brule topped the meal.  The ambience was perfect. There is nothing bad I can say about this place.","921":"Always on my list of places to eat when I work in Tucson.  Great food, great flavor, great drinks, and great prices.  Have never had bad food here.","922":"We came here for lunch having made reservations in advance. When we asked for a table outside, we were told that were none available and wouldn't be for a while. We settled for a table inside. 5 minutes laters party got seated outside in an area that we were told was \"closed.\" We ordered mussels to share among the group (4 of us) and everyone got a sandwich as their main course. The mussels took forever to arrive so we asked them to bring out the mussels and sandwiches at the same time. When the mussels finally came out, they were fishy and drowning in the sauce that wasn't even good. When the manager came over the ask how they were, we were honest and gave her our opinion. She assured us the mussels are just fine. Fine, we kept them. The sandwiches took even longer and at this point we were disappointed with the service. 2 of us got medium well burgers, but they were much more on the well side to the point of being almost dry. The fries that came with the burgers were the poorest excuse for fries I've ever seen. They were just scraps of fried leftovers that one would normally find at the bottom of the French fry order. Someone else had a potato salad with their sandwich that was half raw and the potatoes were undercooked. Then it took forever to bring us the bill. Overall we were highly disappointed with the service and food. Don't be fooled by the pretty garden scenery of this place and go somewhere else. We won't be back again.","923":"Nice decor. Clean. Good service. Good gumbo. The Parish burger was definitely worth it. The bread pudding was okay.","924":"We go here for special occasions and it never disappoints. The food, service, and atmosphere are fantastic.","925":"Lots to recommend: Gumbo, Drunken Angel pasta, Hamburger and Chile Relleno appetizer are fantastic! Shrimp w Grits: bland as oatmeal. The La Verdad cocktail was refreshing and contained adequate liquor compared to the Ice Tea\/Vodka Cocktail which contained very little. The non-traditional cupcake style of bread pudding (is flavorful) but as dry as the Sonoran Desert - hardly any rum sauce (maybe an off day?) The dishes they do well are really good. Patio seating next to parking lot, so you can bring your dog buddy. Glad they are here in Tucson!","926":"Over the years this place has just gotten better! The food is great, the drinks are interesting. I recommend this to anyone who visits, or wants to try something different. Never had bad service when going.","927":"I dont care for collard greens but the red trout was amazing and get the hush puppies now!!!","928":"We came for brunch and never wanted to leave!  My husband loved his shrimp and grits and my Benny was wonderful!","929":"Neat place to get good food. I had the aptly named drunken angel pasta dish. Very good flavors and a hearty portion. The shrimp was perhaps a bit overcooked but the taste was excellent. My parents got the gumbo and an eggplant croquet sandwich. Both were very good. Also this place will not compromise quality of its food. We had to wait a but for our order because one of our dishes was not up to standards of the kitchen. The wait staff was very friendly in explaining what was happening. Also great service. You won't regret coming here. Especially if you like the gastropub style of restaurant.","930":"I went here for a small celebration in a party of 4 last weekend and was less than impressed. The sculpture ground seems great but the food\/service of Rat's is not up to par with their price. My girlfriends cocktail (which was supposed to be some sort of boozed tea) came out tasting like warm dish-water. The eggplant mignion entree is an absolute joke - it's literally a giant piece of eggplant with out-of-the-can tomato sauce. The rabbit pasta was disappointing as well. The croque provencial sandwich had super hard bread which was almost impossible to chew. \nUpon arriving I considered this restaurant as a great location to host an upcoming graduation party - but after eating here I will certainly not be back. \nYou can do better for your $$$!","931":"Last Saturday we came with friends,us from Rio Rico n the friends from Patagonia, to the Parish excited about Cajun good. The welcoming hostess was a bit out of it. The waiter a young energetic guy was great. Gave us the history of the place n explained the menu. We all got excited about the Gumbo. Unfortunately, it was bland n full of rice n small pieces of meat I am guessing it was chicken. It was not close to spicy. We asked for hot sauce. Last Saturday the weather was good so we sat outside. I would say the chili relleno with cheese the appetizer was excellent.","932":"Gotta say the food here was pretty great! I ordered the Drunken Angel pasta and it was frankly mind blowing. It was probably some of the best pasta I've had in my life. While everything else about the visit was good, this is my reason for the 5\/5. It's that good. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, which was pretty solid.\nIt was busy, so we sat at the bar. They have a pretty solid beer selection on tap and it rotates. Hopefully, they'll have some Modern Times soon. The bar tender was suer friendly and the food came out pretty quickly.\nAnyway, I would totally go back here and if you haven't been here yet, you must go soon!","933":"The menu has a lot of nice options from duck to lamb. The food was very flavorful and delicious. We heard there's usually a wait but we came around 6:30 midweek and were seated right away. The atmosphere of this restaurant is like no other! So much character...  we really enjoyed everything about Rat's.","934":"This little gem won't be a secret for long.  This weekend was the grand opening, but it seems fellow Yelpers and foodies have been sampling the fare here for a couple weeks.  And OH, EM, GEE, the food is friggin awesome.  When we came in for a Sunday brunch\/lunch, only a few regulars sat at the bar watching various football games.  First off, there are regulars already... it's been open for one weekend.  So that should tell you something.  The staff was moving slow and just getting things started (by all appearances, it had been a very late night for them).  We started with $2 Abita Ambers (A NOLA microbrew).  All the domestic taps were $2, so pretty much, woohoo already.  Then we got some bacon popcorn and The Man ordered the gumbo while I choose fish and chips.  The bacon popcorn was buttery and peppery.  The PERFECT complement to an ice cold beer.  Bar nuts are sooooo boring.  I say, bring on the bacon popcorn!  The fish and chips, billed as \"the crispiest\" was indeed crispy, the fish was beautifully cooked, and the batter was full of flavor.  The gumbo was also outstanding and the little hushpuppies served alongside did soul food proud.  Pssst, watch out Abbey...  If there is one theme running through The Parish (besides New Orleans, of course) it is well-seasoned.  Like every step of the way, seasoned, then cooked, then seasoned again.  I'm a fan.  It is the true difference of from-scratch cooking and it is a difference you can taste.  So, with sadness I write this review.  Why sad?  I'm afraid everyone will soon know about my secret place and I don't want to share.  I'm selfish, so there.","935":"Yuuuuummmmm! Best thanksgiving meal ever! Thanks to the Parish! Smoked Turkey (tender), stuffing, corn and green beans. Perfect.","936":"Magical, mystical, marvelous.  I love the ambiance.  I love the service.  I love the drinks.  I love the food.  I love the fact that you wander your way in, after walking through a trail of imagination.  I love the fact that there are ducks wandering through the outside seating area.  I love the fact that the restaurant is named after a character in Wind in the Willows.  I love the fact that you can go there and get lost, not only in the food, but in the fairytale.","937":"Whoa! \n\nExcellent food and atmosphere.  \nFamily and I just had the opportunity to visit this restaurant. We started out with the bacon popcorn followed by the shrimp poor boys. The food was excellent, and the staff was very friendly.","938":"Frog legs were tasty. My quail was lovely. My dining companions had steak (yummy sauce) and burger. The bread pudding was \"to die for.\"","939":"I love this place so much that I actually had my rehearsal dinner for my wedding here.  They were very accommodating even though they don't normally do events like that. The owner is very creative and he has made this place extremely unique.  You wont find this type of food and atmosphere anywhere else in Tucson.  Everything I have tried is delicious.","940":"Just recently visited again after a long time. My husband and I went to see a singer songwriter whose music we enjoy. We were originally going just to have a drink but decided to have dinner there. What a treat!! The menu has a little bit of everything so there is something for everyone. I had the shrimp and grits with added crawfish sauce. Absolutely delicious. The collard greens are great as well. My husband had a delicious salad since he was eating clean but he wasn't the least bit disappointed with his choice. It was an extremely savory meal topped off with beignets. Service was prompt and friendly and the decor is authentic. You wouldn't know this restaurant is in a strip mall after you walk in the door. Needless to say we will be returning when we want to indulge in a sinfully delicious meal. I highly recommend this place!!","941":"Came back 3 times in 2 days. Tried multiple dishes and cocktails, Dutch Well Water was incredible as was the bloody. They're unique wall of infused liquor provides endless possibilities. During happy hour we combined the hush puppies, gumbo and the cheese from the pretzels. Great burgers and bread pudding.","942":"I love the unique menu, I just wish there was more of a selection. I feel it is a little pricey for what it offers. The bar is quite amazing I must say. Fully stocked and lots of options. While I love so many of what is on the menu, I just wish there was so much more to choose from!!","943":"This review is written on 4\/8\/2012 ... so if you are going to visit The Parish, be forewarned that it's going to be crowded, not unlike anything new in Tucson.  This is because ppl in Tucson just crave new and novelty things; or is it ppl all over for that matter?  But I digressed. \n\nI joined some friends at The parish a few weeks ago just for socialization and did not plan on eating much.  Upon getting there, I was quite intrigued with the menu items, two of which are frog legs and crawfish hushpuppies.  My friends ordered the bacon-wrapped frog legs and I ordered the hushpuppies, since I love crawfish.  The frog legs did not disappoint.  If you're health conscious, the bacon can be unwrapped and the legs enjoyed somewhat unaltered. No they don't taste like chicken and have a texture all their own.  Yes they are very tender and quite meaty (my memory does not recall frog legs that muscular).  I guess these guys were raised to have huge legs for our enjoyment (gotta love modern farming technique and growth hormone).  \n\nThen came the hushpuppies.  Probably the best fried food worth clogging your arteries for.  They were done to perfection [if you know me, I rarely used the word perfection]; crispy on the outside and moist with a hint of sweetness from the cornmeal on the inside.  But ... there is no flavor or bits of crawfish (as the menu suggested).  Normally, this is cause enough for me to discount the establishment as legit.  However, in this case, the hushpuppies were so good on their own merit that I decided to overlook this mis-representation (see perfection above).  Oh ... almost forgot, the onion marmalade that comes with the hush puppies as dipping sauce, let me just say that I do not have enough vocabulary to tell you how good it is and how well it goes with the hushpuppies. A perfect blend (there is that p-word again) of sweet and tangy, yet not overpowering, I can drink that stuff straight up ...\n\nOne small thing that impressed me about this place is that food comes out nice and hot - just like it was just coming off the frying pan or whatever cookware used to make it.  Small detail, but such is what makes or breaks a restaurant.\n\nSo there you have it - frog legs and hushpuppies worth a visit.  Not all items on the menu are New Orleans in nature.  I am waiting for the novelty to subside or summer to arrive, whichever comes first,  to return to The Parish for another sampling.\n\n'til then ... I am feeling generous (it's Easter) enough to give them a four (4) star rating :-p","944":"First off, I have only visited The Parish twice, due to proximity issues - I have no urge to drive drunk from Oracle & Orange Grove back to Downtown, and it would be nearly impossible to not get trashed, thanks to $3 you-call-it happy hours on weekdays. Yeah, that's right - $3 - whatever you want - four straight hours Monday-Friday. What?!?!?\n\n On my first visit, I went for a friend's birthday dinner (well, the drinking post-dinner portion), and only tried the popcorn. Not a fan, but I suspect it had been out on the table for a while before I arrived, and I feel like my dad somehow knows it from 2 states away every time I eat anything involving bacon, so there was an element of Jewish guilt involved. I was driving, so no chugging dangerous amounts of bourbon as I normally would, but that night they had a Saturnalia event ($5 wine tasting w\/ a d.j.), so I participated in that rather than enjoy any of the house cocktails, although the 10-15 other people I was with were raving about them. Most importantly, the birthday boy was extremely happy with his food & drinks.\n\n The second time I went, it was around 4:00 in the afternoon, and I was REALLY pissed off. I was trapped on that side of town, screwing around with the DMV & their massive computer failure. I sat at the bar, slammed a Maker's & Coke, and checked out the food menu. Not a lot of choices for someone who doesn't really eat seafood or pork, so I ordered the pretzel bites. The bartender (who was really nice) informs me about five minutes later that they're out. During Friday happy hour?!?!? If we ran out of pretzels where I work right before happy hour (or ever), heads would roll. So, I get the goat cheese relleno (minus the bacon), hoping it wouldn't be a total nightmare. It was SO good!!! Overflowing with goat cheese, perfectly cooked & paired with the pico and balsamic drizzle - I was really happy with it. Ordered another Maker's & Coke, chatted with a guy about working in record stores, then got up & left. Got into my car, realized I was pretty much drunk ($6!), went across the street and made ill-advised, drunk purchases at T.J. Maxx ($42) until I was sober enough to drive home.\n\n Minus one star because: the menu could be a bit bigger, and provide more options for people who don't do pork, shellfish, etc. Also, it's hard to put my finger on exactly why, but the interior is a bit cheap-looking. This shouldn't really matter, but I think we all know that it kind of does. Ideally, they would run a shuttle to\/from the downtown area, but I understand that this is merely a pipe dream. However, if you, Parish, were to give me what no one else in town has been able to give me - a GOOD shredded bbq beef sandwich - I would be your b!tch forever. Think about it...","945":"This place is wonderful.  Delicious food and great service.\nThe bread pudding is to die for, smoked salmon salad is amazing not to mention all of the wonderful items on the menu.\nWe can't get enough of this place.","946":"The vegetarian eggplant option was not good..  It was also room temperature. I felt too embarrassed to send back, tried to eat half of it.  The donuts for dessert were also not anything incredible. Not a hit for me..  My coworkers seemed to enjoy their meal, though.","947":"Such a TREAT!  This place is so good.  Wife and I had the Smoked Trout appetizer and Shrimp & Grits for an Entree.  \nThe Smoked Trout included Toasted bread, sauteed onions, special mustard and the most delicious smoked fish.  It is such a fun plate. \nAs for the Shrimp & Grits....OMG! The sauce is so damn delicious.  My wife has not stopped taking about it. The Collard greens it came with were so tasty.\nI cannot believe it took us this long to try this place.  We can't wait try everything on the menu.","948":"Ok the food is still thoroughly excellent but the remodel is not so good.  Double front doors introduced a chilling breeze every time it opens and every time the kitchen door opens the dining room is flooded with harsh neon light and you get a great view of all their cleaning fluids neatly stacked on stainless racks?  Ambience went down a few notches but food and service are top notch.","949":"Read some reviews that were mixed but glad I went anyway.  Loved it.  Wife and I went for our anni and loved the mixed cheese and humus appetizers.  That's all we needed!  Drinks had actual liquor in them.  Server heard it was our anni and brought us a special desert tray.  View of the Garden for Sculpture stunning.  Restaurant in a courtyard like a French Village.  Price is high but acceptable for quality.  Lunch and Happy Hour good times.  Not good for a speed lunch though.","950":"I love love the parish! The food is absolutely amazing and very few places have beer that I like, and they have several that I absolutely love. Cajun style food, can be on the spicy side. It's great for a date night or even lunch. It's a little on the pricey side, you're looking at $50-70 for two with drinks, but totally worth it. The atmosphere and staff are amazing as well, absolutely no complaints there. One of my favorite places to eat by far!","951":"A quick review\n\nTook my wife out for a special night. I've always wanted to try Rats having heard others talk about it and seeing it from the gardens. \n\nAtmosphere was perfect, the only thing better would have been to sit outside in the warm night air. My expectations where high - we even dressed the part. \n\nOur server's accent was so thick it made listening very difficult and our meals were uninspiring, good but not enough to say I was wowed. The only thing that we really enjoyed was the appetizer and our dessert, both of which we didn't order. \n\nWe both thought KC prime was better for the money.","952":"Rarely leave reviews on Yelp, but I have to mention one thing: the service was outstanding! From the person who seated us to our waiter, everyone was very friendly (but not uncomfortably so), down-to-earth and easy to talk to, not to mention fast and attentive to our table. From beginning to end, The Parish wowed us - an unexpected find!","953":"Sorry so late posting. I was there last Friday passing thru to head to a meeting. I ordered the Salmon Salad to go. When ever I order a salmon salad it's usually a piece of fish on top of the salad, not this one. Every bite had fish as well as a mix of pomegranate, gold raisins, candies pecans. Super Delish! Brunch is amazing","954":"Yum .  This was our first visit and we will be back.  Drunken Angel and Gumbo were very  good and you can have some dishes made with less heat.  Service was great too.","955":"We made the mistake of not making reservations but this place was worth the wait! We had unbelievable seafood pasta with toast. They were very accommodating to my shrimp allergy and substituted crawfish at no charge. The bacon popcorn was to die for and the fun beer selection made it an even better experience. The decorations were very authentic. I will be returning with more friends in the future.","956":"1. Ambience 5\n2. Menu Selection Is Authentic 5 \n3. Food Quality 5 - cheese platter yum...\n4. Food Presentation 5\n5. Service 3  - the server who took the order did take a photo of us very nicely on our request. He did suggest the perfect Bloody Mary so Thank You!\nWhile taking our order on being interrupted he did not like it. I was the only adult on table and after I have ordered my Bloody Mary and Apple Cider for kids; I did not wanted to further listen about the beverage selection\nThen after taking the order while he was leaving he did seemed not amused and made a face expression that was observed by my kids.\nLater he disappeared and another person attended to our table who was a lovely lady server. Dude at least introduce the other server if you do not intend to serve us any more!","957":"Fantastic meal!  I went here for my birthday dinner - at the recommendation of my fellow yelpers.  Upon first impression, I was pleasantly pleased.  It wasn't trying to be anything that is was not.  The restaurant is relatively small (I would estimate about 12-15 tables) and you seat yourself.  I was waiting on my date when I first arrived and was promptly offered a menu and glass of water.  \n\nWhen ordering, the waitstaff warned me that the spicy pulled pork is 'very spicy'.  They offered to let me try some before making my final decision - which was appreciated.  The pork was seasoned with cloves and cinnamon, and was as spicy as the name said.  I went ahead and ordered it and traded meals with my man (he had the fish and chips).  Both were delish.  I especially loved the fries and garlic aioli. \n\nDefinitely a good experience and I will be going back!  Reasonably priced meals and quick service are always refreshing.","958":"My experience for recent Sunday brunch for a party of six was I'm mediocre service at some great food and some average food and some below average food that sums it up the fruit salad was completely disappointing I've seen better at 2 star hotels on route 95 travel between New Jersey and Florida the waiter waited a half an hour to set our table when we ask for the desert part of the buffet coffee was had to be on demand every single time would walk by see an empty coffee cup and not fill it with water glasses and it was too noisy and too loud but it is a beautiful restaurant and it's wonderful to walk the grounds go when its not busy and they're going to give you better service try ordering off the menu and not the buffet because it was uneven.","959":"The Tucson sun deceived me -- as a NM desert dweller myself I figured I could handle it. I stayed out by the pool at my hotel all day and I was pretty fried by the time that I went to dinner at The Parish.\n\nThat is why, when I took my first bite of the Lamb Charizo flat bread, I thought that I was hallucinating. Or maybe I'd reached my end and somehow made it past Saint Peter. It was simply phenomenal. The spicy charizo was perfectly seasoned, the goat cheese was a tangy compliment to the lamb and that herb aioli cooled it all down. I was not willing to share, but just to ensure my continued mortal existence, I gave my husband one bite to confirm its deliciousness.  \n\nAnd OH THE DRINKS.  Beers galore and cocktails made from house infused liquors. What more could a sun-soaked girl ask for?\n\nThis place is small, funky and seriously tasty.  Go early or prepare wait for a table to open up, because even at 6 PM on a Tuesday night they were already packed, and with good reason: Tucsonites have good taste!","960":"This was a first visit to The Parish after hearing many good things about the the restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised. Loved the Southern Style Cuisine, from the Crawfish Hushpuppies to the The Drunken Angel. Jessie, our server was attentive and made sure everything was to our liking. Their cocktails are great. Overall a great experience and definitely on our list of restaurants worth going to go again.","961":"This place was absolutely superb. The menu has tons of excellent choices on it. I had the drunken pasta and it was awesome. The drinks are also great. Definitely worth a visit if you like Cajun style food.","962":"We came when they had their brunch menu. First time here and it wasn't busy. I ordered the shrimp and grits with a sunny egg and my bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I loved my shrimp and grits!!! They were white cheddar grits and the sauce they used was just delicious! I would order this again and now I have a place to go to for shrimp and grits. My bf did not like his pulled pork sandwich because it was dry (and it was ). He had to ask for extra BBQ sauce. Also they charged extra for cut up potatoes? Our waiter wasn't awesome. Overall, I would come back for the grits and my bf said he'd order the grits next time","963":"Let's start with miss Olivia and the intrepid's they were the perfect music background for  the Montre for his restaurant . David our waiter  was knowledgeable friendly and even funny at times! The black mussels in chorizo were some of the best we've had in a long time. We haven't ordered trout in a long time because we find it bland however the ruby trout served here was outstanding! Anything with the crawfish looked good! All to be topped off when we found out that red wine was half price on Monday.","964":"Only went to the bar at Rat's, but what a funky place! \n\nMiddle eastern or Indian influenced decor inside, a western American theme on the exterior, with a French menu... sounds off, but it works. GORGEOUS garden lined with blooming flowers, a pond, art & sculptures. Romantic. \n\nRat's really a find, I was not expecting it to be there. So different from the nearby restaurants in Central NJ. Happy hour is definitely a steal. The menu is a bit expensive for the area. A must go to during the summer months. Sit outside on their patio. Love it.","965":"I enjoyed it. Great decor, great service, and great dinner. If you love beer the menu is insane - even gluten free choices. Bacon popcorn is a must. Adobe pork was fantastic.","966":"Excellent service. Good burger, bun toasted just right and temperature nearly as perfect as you can get. Music - just right. Well done Parish!","967":"My husband and I visited recently, on a rare night out sans kids. We had a great meal; friendly, attentive service and tasty food. Portion sizes were great too! Born and raised in Louisiana, we're both tentative to try anything marketed as Cajun, but the gumbo was legit, and they serve actual SWEET tea - thank you! The baked oysters were pricey, but worth every penny, and the quail was perfect. We also ordered the bread pudding and got a hefty portion of that delicious-ness!\nThe atmosphere was good, but we were seated too close to the bar and it got a little rowdy towards the end of our meal. In retrospect, we should've asked for a quiet corner. \nWe would come back often if we didn't live in SE Tucson!","968":"Excellent yet again. This has been my second trip to Rat's in the past two years and it does not disappoint. My filet was cooked to perfection. The service is always top notch, the wine selection is excellent and the atmosphere can't be beat. Would highly recommend.\n\nLeave yourself plenty of time before or after dinner to tour the grounds for sculpture.","969":"Somehow we'd always driven past on our way to somewhere else. Being that we're both by products of catholic schooling might have something to do with that hmm... Oh how we've missed out! Right off the top, our server was excellent & the menu, imaginative. Fish & chips - yay! What is so often disappointing (gooey, thick breading and\/or oldish fish) is a superstar here. The freshest cod I've ever had. Perfectly coated, to my liking, as well. The fries could've been a bit crispier but were still very good. Both portions were mega sized.\n\nHusband had the quail and thought it fantastic. Tender & very flavorful. Served with cheddar grit cake the size of a brick but moist yet crunchy. Yum.\n\nOur server, Kelsey, was outstanding. No more drive bys. We are now converts @ The Parish.","970":"We found a jewel! I can't believe we did not hear about this place sooner.  Thank you to Janis at the Laurita Winery Inn for recommending.  The restaurant, by itself, is phenominal. Great food,  specializing in modern takes on french country cuisine. Amazing wine and cheese selections. I followed the cheese plate with a lamb tasting that was accompanied by a new take on ratatouille. The grilled lamb chop was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The lamb stew, made with lots of veggies and herbs was also a treat. The brussel sprouts with butternut squash in butter along with the dreamiest whipped potatoes  (pommes puree) were amazing. Their complimentary assortment of breads and artisan butter were great. During the meal they bring you this strange pastry called a \"pop over\". Buttery chewy crunchy goodness. Almost too full for dessert but the peanut butter mousse along with the complimentary tasting plate from the pastry chef were amazing. The wait staff was extremely educated on the food and wine as well as very friendly and efficient. Now here's the kicker, the restaurant was designed as an integral part of a huge sculpture garden\/park. The park is unbelievable and it gets better at night with all of the theatrical lighting.  We're not talking about a few acres either. The owner of the old industrial park hired 8 architects to compete for the final plans for this food and art theme park. Amazing place.","971":"I haven't had a bad meal at The Parish. The hush puppies and the Drunken Pasta are amazing! The bread pudding is awesome! I haven't had bad service at The Parish. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. However, the last two times I have visited it's been HOT! They need to turn their AC down - sweating while eating indoors  is icky.","972":"This was my second trip to Rat's on business related travel to the area, and this experience lived up to the fond memories from my first trip nearly 4 years ago. \n\nBe prepared for a great experience! I would make sure you have plenty of time to check out the entire place. There are sculptures of very lifelike people posed out front, and dispersed throughout the amazing plants, flowers, and trees at the back of the premises. Start by going out of the bar area, and take an immediate left...even though you see a sign low to the ground that says \"no admittance\" don't be deterred. Listen for the sound of music, and running water and you will encounter a very realistic \"employee shower\" sculpture scene. Don't worry, not too graphic, about as detained as a Barbie doll, but very entertaining as it can catch you by surprise. Follow the trail around the garden area to see several other scenes posed throughout the breathtaking views of a lake, flowers, and a lovely bridge over a water feature with steam rising all around. \n\nYou can wander throughout the interior to view an eclectically decorated mix of dining spaces on both floors.\n\nThe food is amazing. I was with a group and we tried an array of options. While the menu is primarily in French, the staff are very friendly and helpful to interpret any questionable options. We tried the salad with candied nuts and vinaigrette, squash tart, and onion soup appetizers-everyone was pleased. \n\nFor dinner, the entrees included: Salmon, Eggplant (looks like a steak, but it's not!), Filet Mignon, Roasted Chicken, Scallops, and Braised Beef Short Ribs-all were cooked and seasoned perfectly and plated with various vegetables, polenta, and sauces and disappeared within minutes. \n\nThey also have a \"chef's treat\" bright out before the meal-ours was a Moroccan carrot salad in a ceramic spoon to whet your appetite, along with bread, and a wide array of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. \n\nThey have a coffee and dessert menu, but we were all too stuffed to indulge, but don't worry, if you want a little something sweet, they bring a selection of \"chef's treat\" dessert options that include bite-size portions of brownie, banana bread, and other delectable delights to finish with that touch of sweetness. \n\nThe initial service was a bit slow to get drinks, but we had a party of 10+ people who arrived at various intervals. After that, the staff were very helpful, friendly, and gave us a 5 star experience.\n\nIf you're in the area, we highly recommend it!!","973":"Oh my goodness, what a phenomenal burger. One of the best I've had, ever. Seasoned rich beef, gruyere cheese, apple wood bacon, Louis sauce, bib lettuce on a brioche bun. Restaurant is gorgeous, museum is beautiful. Also had the French onion soup, devine...get yourself here for lunch or dinner.","974":"I dislike I have to say this about Rat's.  I have been looking forward to dining at restaurant for years.  I have gone for happy hour before and it was good, the ambiance, the lite fare, the wine, however I was let down by dinner.  The service was impeccable, however I felt as if I could have cooked the food better myself.  I know I have high expectations when it comes to the food I eat, and unfortunately, Rat's did not meet my expectations.  We had the cheese platter which was great; I love cheese, we had a taste of all of the cheeses offered.  For dinner, I had the Roasted Filet Mignon, which was pretty good but not as good as I expected from such a high rated restaurant.  My boyfriend had the Quatre Viandes Bolognese, which again was good, but not amazing.  \nThe staff was attentive, friendly, however the food was cosi-cosi.","975":"Very disappointed !\nHostess rude both on the phone and in person .\nWould not give us lunch reservation - only brunch which is WAY over priced and rate not published .\nDuring our entire stay there were unoccupied tables for lunch but yet she refused to sit us for lunch.\nFood okay, decor nice, but doesn't justify the very high price that doesn't even include the beverage.","976":"The Parish is a great addition to Tucson.  The bacon and egg dish is what dreams (and new addictions) are made of.  The presentation pales in comparison only to the spectacular textures and flavors of the dish.  The burgers are glorious, and you taste the freshness in each savory bite.  It is a burger where you don't want anything extra on it because the taste is so wonderful all by itself.  The crawfish hushpuppies are equally delectable. When you're done scarfing the hushpuppies, you feel the need to shoot the dipping sauce so you don't miss a drop. The Haitian pulled pork leaves you with the full-belly delirium and perma-grin.  How can you go wrong with that?  I honestly cannot get enough of this place!!","977":"WOW! Absolutely the best dinner ever, from the beer, appetizers, and the main course. Don't forget to have the bread pudding for dessert. Chelsea, our waitress, did an awesome job. Highly recommend  it.","978":"We went for Father's Day and were not disappointed.  The cocktails are the best I have had in a long time and the food is excellent.  We will be frequent customers.","979":"The food is very good, French style, and the interior is interesting.  Prices are a bit high.  A good deal is to come for the happy hour and sit on the patio.  There is an entrance to Grounds for Sculpture from the restaurant.","980":"Wonderful dining experience.  We highly recommend Rat's, it is an unusual place, with unique atmosphere.  Driving up, you will feel like you're going back in time, to a quaint French Inn.  The food is outstanding, and was obviously prepared by a very talented team of chefs.  We had the salmon, which was light (yes light), and airy, cooked to perfection. Light seems to be a theme as our carrot cake was like eating carrot scented clouds, just wonderful.  We are already planning our next visit as we have added Rat's to our list of favorite restaurants.","981":"Decor was very interesting but I loved it.  I ordered the omelet with smoked salmon.  The omelet was good but the salmon was very fishy tasting (ugh).  Dessert made up for it.  Dark chocolate cake with lavender.  Absolutely delicious.","982":"Brought my staff here for Christmas dinner last year. Despite having a reservation we waited over an hour and then ate at the bar. Not what I was hoping. Food was good and once we ordered, the staff was pleasant but for a place in this price range, the experience was unacceptable.","983":"Try the parish burger! I don't even like red onions, but the red onion marmalade on it is awesome! I definitely recommend coming here for good food, good drinks, and good company","984":"The last two times we went for dinner we were not impressed. I think it's because we went on a \"special night\" with a prixe-fixe menu. I hear the brunch is worth a visit, we have plans to try that! \n\nOverall, a lovely location, nice staff and wonderful comfort food. However, there is some value left on the table for what you pay, in my opinion. \n\nThe freshly made bread basket is fantastic, wine list is good, food is very nice and service was ok. We liked our starter and entree. They used to have an escargot dish and a truffle soup that was to die for. Although it's a lovely walk, be prepared to walk from the parking lot. \n\nThere was a nightclub or something happening when we were there last. It seemed odd in the white table cloth setting and bothered me that people kept opening door in January because I felt the breeze at my table. \n\nFor dinner, not what it used to be. But we do want to come back for brunch one day.","985":"Came here for brunch today. I am only giving it 2 stars because the food was good. Small selection but tasteful. The reason I am giving it 2 stars was because the service was horrible. Waited 30 minutes to be seated with a reservation. The service was obsolete. After we sat down, we hardly saw our sever. Our water glasses were constantly empty. Our dirty plates were never cleared. I get that a buffet is self service but when I have to put our plates on a credenza, that's a bad sign. The server finally checked on us and offered us the dessert that comes with brunch and then never came back. We never got the dessert. The restaurant was empty. We decided to leave. Had to ask another server for the check. It completely ruined my birthday brunch!","986":"The space is inviting and the detailed decor really draws you in, setting up an expectation which the restaurant unfortunately does not meet.  Four of us walked in for brunch prior to a delightful wander through the Grounds for Sculpture.  Prix-fixe brunch was $39 and included champagne or mimosa, buffet, entree, and dessert buffet; which is an excellent deal if you have a big appetite.  We just wanted entrees and the waitress was kind enough to offer us an a la carte menu.  The dishes sounded scrumptious on the menu but were disappointing on delivery.  A tedious lox omelet was served with a huge puddle of watery juice circling around the plate -- as another reviewer mentioned, the eggs were not allowed to drain properly before plating -- not appetizing at all.  The kitchen was accommodating with my request of egg whites and salad in place of fries on the steak & eggs, but the egg whites were prepared with way too much oil and\/or butter.  The salad was browning in places and the dressing was unpalatable.  I can whip up a decent dijon vinaigrette in less than a minute and I'm no top chef; so I expect MUCH better from a professional chef.  Mussels were bland, fries were tasty.\n\nThe service was a bit hit-or-miss:  Our waitress was friendly and accommodating but made a few mistakes: 1. neglected to ask me what temperature I wanted my steak; 2. took FOREVER to bring our coffee; 3. did not keep water glasses filled; and 4. kept mispronouncing \"prix-fixe\".  If I'm paying $40 per person for brunch I better darn well not EVER see the bottom of my water glass.\n\nMy mother-in-law had been there before and received admission to the Grounds with the price of a meal at Rat's.  They have discontinued this practice and now the restaurant is separate; so be prepared to pay admission to the Grounds even if you dine at the restaurant.  The major issue with this is that the restaurant IS an entrance to the grounds, so there is a pretty consistent stream of people walking through the restaurant to get to the Grounds.  Kind of annoying if you're sitting in the atrium area -- and if it's cold outside, you do NOT want to be seated next to the constantly opening door!\n\nI'm a little confused about who is running this place -- the website says the restaurant is now being run by Steven Starr group and Shane Cash is listed as Exec. Chef; however on the menus it still says Kevin Sbraga.  So who is responsible for this culinary mediocrity?","987":"Love this place. Must stop in if you are visiting from out of town. I usually have the TChop, a monster pork chop.  Last night I had the gumbo and smoked trout. Both outstanding.  Ate at the bar and our waitress was fantastic.  I do not live in Tucson and when I visit I have one meal here","988":"Really, really solid food. Taste, value, quality, all that.\n\nI had the Haitian pork sandwich, which was great and startlingly spicy (in a delicious way). Good crisp slaw, and dang, those fries, those fries, man. \n\nFour stars though? The food choice is sadly limited. Some sandwiches, some salads, and three entrees is not a wide variety. That said, it is of course better to have a small menu done well than a big menu done poorly.\nI'd probably have been fine with the size of the menu if they had a nightly food special or two, to at least show there's active playing around with ideas and ingredients beyond the occasional menu refresh. I bet there probably are specials on Friday\/Saturday, but we went on a Monday so no dice.\nAdditionally, billing as a gastropub and having ~4 beers (good craft beers at least) on tap is a little disappointing. They had a wider variety of bottles, but that isn't draft beer.","989":"Had the soft shell crab, really good crab and the vegetarian chorizo was nice with the egg and the arugulla. The English muffin was too thick and had a strange gritty texture, but hey I needed to skip carbs. Loved the ambiance and decor, aside from drunk  college girls with daddy issues.","990":"We went to the Parrish Restaurant on a whim not knowing before hand what to expect. I was very pleased. \nThe menu included many items which I had never seen before. \nThe greens which came with my trout was among the best I have ever had. The other adults in the group throughly enjoyed their meal. \nThe two teenagers refused to try anything which they were not familiar. They ordered salad but left most of it. We should have left them home. \nThis is a fine restaurant serving food with a southern flair.","991":"Once again I went to the Parish, but this time was for happy hour.  We had about 7+ people in our group and we sat on the patio.  The service again was amazing!!! \n\nI only ordered two cocktails and the amazing BACON POPCORN (which I have fallen in love with) and tell EVERYONE about!!!  \n\nI had the stolli vanilla vodka and diet coke -- which I have come to love here.  Pretty simple drink, but it is delicious.  I did try the root beer flavored vodka with soda water....it was  decent, but I would have liked it sweeter...maybe next time I'll try it with sugar water or sprite to make it sweeter.  \n\nIt is a great place to go!  It is such a fun place to visit and the happy hour is amazing!","992":"The backyard burger was tasty, along with a fresh salad and a dressing that tasted homemade.  Also tried the pimpanadas which were unique in taste with a sweet and spicy flavor, the breading was delish while the jerk chicken was just ok .  Found the service to be excellent.  It may be a good idea to make a reservation on a Saturday night, we didn't have reservations and waited about 20 minutes.","993":"The restaurant itself is beautiful, the location is fantastic and the outdoor seating as well as the bar are all very nice. The service is pretty good, normal attentiveness and you don't feel like you're forgotten or anything.\n\nHowever, the food is very...meh. I've gone there twice now and tried about 6 different things on the menu ranging from appetizers to main entrees to desserts, all tasted just okay. Definitely not bad, but just edible. For a restaurant that is so gorgeous and so well put together, it was very disappointing that the food is so lackluster.\n\nOn the other hand, the wines I had both times were really really good.","994":"This place is beautiful, especially the outdoor seating. If you are seated outside, you have a view of a Monet painting come to life! \n\nI came here for lunch with the bf and his parents. The service was great and the food was good. \n\nBest part is after dinner you can go walk around the sculpture garden which is absolutely amazing!","995":"The Parish has been bookmarked on my \"To Try' list since I moved to Tucson. I finally tried it out on Friday night, and although the food was great, service was a bit disappointing.\n\nWe came just before 7 and only had to wait about 15 minutes, but people who arrived shortly after us were being quoted 30 minutes or more. If you don't want to wait, you may want to come a little earlier.\n\nOnce we were sat, it took 5-10 minutes for our waiter to come by. Unfortunately, this trend continued throughout the night. I think we spent more time waiting for our waiter to bring things or take our order than we did actually enjoying our food. He was very nice, but not nice enough to make up for the waiting.\n\nI didn't order a cocktail on this visit, but I definitely will next time. The cocktails all sounded really good, and the beer menu was huge! Instead of drinks, we started with an order of the bacon popcorn which was delicious! It had a bit too much black pepper, but overall, I would definitely order it again.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was really good. It was crispy, but not greasy, which is quiet the feat to achieve with fried foods. However, be aware that fish is not the typical presentation you get when you order fish and chips. Instead of it being several pieces of fish, it was just one big filet on top of a pile of fries (which by the way were also super tasty!)\n\nMy boyfriend had the Parish Burger, which has blue cheese and red onion marmalade. Although he hates onions, he loved this burger, and from the bite he shared with me, I have to agree. I'm not a blue cheese fan, but I would consider ordering that in the future. It was a good-sized burger, flavorful, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nAll in all, while the food was really good, the service really dragged things down for me. I will definitely be back for a visit though. I would like to try lunch next time, since they only have their po' boy available during the day.","996":"Let's just say...when we travel and eat fish and chips around the US - even on the coasts - we say \"but is it better than The Parish?\" So far nothing has stood up to this test. Get the fish and chips, people. You won't be disappointed!","997":"the outside is really cool.  i really like the smoking head in the water. the inside, the food isn't as good as it used to be.  i miss the great yorkshire pudding that they served for years.\n\ni keyed some assholes car on mothers day because he stole my spot and gave my mother lip.  give lip and i give key.","998":"Exterior is 70's strip mall but interior was authentic. Staff was extremely friendly and competent, a perfect combo. Food was excellent, hot and timely. Craft beers a plus. Four happy customers at our table. Will highly recommend - exceeded expectations.","999":"We couldn't get a reservation for Mother's Day even trying a few days before but since it's raining we decided to try. Got a seat at the bar. Wonderful food, great service, interesting decor. They were very accommodating with food allergies. Will definitely come again even if not going to Grounds for Sculpture. Thanks Matt, Mike , and Sean ay the bar.","1000":"So I love love love salads. I can't make them myself though because I never get that right balance of ingredients and it's always just so boring when I try to come up with my own combinations. Anyway, I really wanted to try the Drunken Angel pasta as I've heard it's delicious but I'm being good today and I got the Salmon Salad... Let me tell ya, that was a solid choice. The salmon was shredded all through the salad, there was fresh pomegranate, crunchy walnuts, and little pieces of bacon. Honestly, I'm not the biggest bacon fan so I could have done without that but obviously that's a personal preference so it wasn't like it deterred from the rest of the ingredients. There were also golden raisins which were a nice addition. The balance of sweet and salty in this salad was honestly perfection for lack of a better word. I would definitely order again. Also, the dressing was so tasty. A little bit went a long way and normally I don't use salad dressings but this one was exceptional. Can't wait to try more dishes from here!","1001":"Really enjoyed this place!!!\n\nWe did have to send back the double cut pork chop which had amazing flavor just because it was a little too done for our liking.\n\nThe Johnny Steak was amazing. Frog legs also. So many things on the menu at this place look insane and all the food around us was as rest as what we got.\n\nHighly recommend if you're in Tucson. We were visiting","1002":"Homemade pastrami was beautifully assembled, but it was weak on flavor.  The mustard based condiment had strong flavoring, which made the sandwich edible.  However, the accompanied potato salad was fantastic, though bordering on too sour and salty.\n\nSimilarly, leek & mushroom appetizer was weak on flavor as well with rather unpleasant damp odor, though it was beautifully presented.  The only appetizer I would order again was salmon tartine.  Freebie bread with shallot butter was delicious as well.\n\nGood beer on the top to wash down generally rich-on-fat dishes.  And service at the bar was very attentive and professional.  Great job, bartenders!","1003":"Wasn't too impressed with the food quality for the price. Decor was great. Definitely go for happy hour during the week at the bar before 7pm.  Half price wine and specialty drinks. If the food was better, I would have given it four stars.  Walk around out back of the restaurant. There is a lot of cool things that you can see and you can take your drink with you around the grounds.","1004":"Ordered the namesake burger, which was exceptional. I'm always annoyed w\/ a soggy bun, but this was perfection as were the hush puppies. The food was creative, well presented, and delish! Only seat available was at the bar, bit crowded on a Friday night, but bar staff were very attentive. Decor definitely leaves something to be desired, but then I did come for the food!","1005":"0h may gawd real amazing flavors SO GREAT! I had gumbo with half and half shrimp and crawfish. The portion is perfect but the flavors made want a second bowl! Their nosh apps we had the Crawfish hushpuppies were also amazing and the flavors really are top notch. They offer a nice selection of \"Liquid Courage\" and on tap local and Louisiana beer. Absolutely great for lunch or dinner open 11am -10pm Fun staff too","1006":"TWO STARS AT BEST, AND THAT REALLY IS PUSHING IT.\n\nTwo times at Rat's:\n\nOnce at the bar for drinks and appetizers. Not bad.\n\nSecond time was for brunch with friends, 6 or 7 of us. Excessively warm October day 2014. Horrible.\n\nGrounds For Sculpture is beautiful blah blah blah, great art blah blah blah, what a fabulous idea to put  the old Fairgrounds to good use blah blah blah. Yes, I know that already. But overall lousy food and abysmal service really has nothing to do with the museum \/ sculpture grounds and I find it quite amusing of the many thrilling comments from people who have been obviously mesmerized by the art and believed the food was actually GOOD...(Compared to what? Seriously? Dog food?!)\n\nTruth is, what you have with Rat's is an absolutely GORGEOUS restaurant, seriously, it is positively PERFECT in terms of ambiance. No expense was spared and it shows. HOWEVER, take an over priced, over cooked hamburger and throw that on one of your Provencal Directoire tables and suddenly the place becomes a sad reality.\n\nOur brunch was basically FAIR in terms of main courses. Nothing special, nothing great, most was over cooked \"hotel food\" with perhaps a twist here or there. The brunch buffet table was located in this weird,  almost inaccessible balcony room, thru an odd doorway, and I must say, for a beautiful place,  the food was placed on that table without care of any aesthetics whatsoever. FLIES ruled the buffet and dining room, the biting kind. NOT GOOD. Seafood, which looked like leftovers from the week's UNSOLD bin, were placed on small trays, or plates, without ice,  and some of these plates looked like someone began to put food on their plate and just left it there. BUT THESE WERE THE OFFERINGS. Very sparse. Almost empty! And nobody went back the second time because someone (the chef) wasn't refilling the three shrimp that they put out in the first place! Overall the buffet was really disgusting and done in a haphazard,unattractive and inconvenient way.\n\nThe service was really really horrible. The servers seemed on edge and forgot things. Extremely slow service.  In fact the day we were there, we could hear waiters and waitress arguing, possibly even bullying another waiter for whatever reason. Loudly. Insults, name calling........it was certainly not a nice thing to observe. At the end, forget about dessert.....we all wanted to leave, look at the sculpture and get the hell out of Dodge!\n\nI really really wanted to say this place was amazing but I sadly can't. I may go back...YES, I may...probably will...for dinner to see if they improved. We'll see..............","1007":"My husband and I have been trying out new eateries,  to us, each Sunday for Brunch.  The Parish did not disappoint! The ambiance was both funky and warm, the service was friendly and exceptional. Thanks Jeff! The food surpassed our expectations.  I had the Creamy BBQ Shrimp and Grits. I highly recommend this dish. We'll be back and will definitely recommend!","1008":"A couple years ago I would've said don't waste your time at this place. Today I say give it a try. Been in a few times recently and it's been consistently good. All the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. House cocktails are delicious. Parish burger is yummy!! So are the frog legs and gumbo. I haven't tried anything I don't like. I'll keep coming back.","1009":"Great meal and drinks. Fast service which is helpful with small kids. We were there early, before 5:30 so not many other people eating.","1010":"I went to Rat's with my great-aunt, aunt, cousin, and mom for an afternoon outing. We had such a wonderful meal! The hummus was homemade (a huge plus) and the food was definitely above par. We went for lunch and I felt that we got our money's worth. The dinner menu is pricier but considering the setting - sculptures are accessible \/ visible from the restaurant - it's worth it.","1011":"I have been to The Parish on two other occasions. My family and I chose The Parish for Easter Brunch yesterday.  \n\nMy Daughters are not big \"foo foo\" diners and the server was actually insulting toward them at times.  They didn't like either of their pastas and the server didn't ask why when boxing their full plates to go.  \n\nSome flexibility on how an egg is cooked would have been appreciated.  We didn't receive any water until we requested it and were not asked if we wanted any drinks after the first round. My husband and I enjoyed our meals.","1012":"First time here. Service was great, very attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Had the oysters on a half shell, they were amazing. Had a smoked cocktail sauce on them that was different than any other cocktail sauce I've ever had. Main courses were delicious and the right size. Drunken angel and gumbo both very good. Will definitely be back for the drunken angel.","1013":"Rats is excellent. I didn't know what to expect after someone told me they left here hungry but I already had reservations. I left completely full, with leftovers for another day, and TOTALLY satisfied. The atmosphere is spacious but cozy, and very unique. I  had predetermined that in such an ambiance based establishment, the food would probably be standard and nothing memorable, and I was totally wrong. Our food AND drinks (try the melon mojito)  were totally delicious and well worth the price for a special occasion. Chicken conft appetizer was delicious and the accompanying mushrooms were to die for. My risotto was WONDERFUL and included many unexpected and quite delicious flavors, such as squash. My very picky, and quite fancy boyfriend, loved his short ribs, and also took half of his food home (in tinfoil sculpted into a rat! cute touch.)  We also got a little bonus pate tasting prepared by the chef, bonus popovers halfway through our meal, and a delicious and unexpected array of chocolates with the bill. \n\nMy only criticism which isn't even of Rats but  for the Grounds for Sculpture\/Rats experience, is it would be really great if admission to the park (which is literally attached to the back of the restaurant) was included with dining in, because you will be spending a considerable amount on dinner here. I would have really enjoyed seeing the park but we unfortunately didn't have the money in cash to enter. We will be returning sometime soon with cash in hand, probably after 6 when the park is half priced, for happy hour (Tuesday through Friday) and a stroll. Will definitely update my review and I can't wait.","1014":"Went for brunch and it was amazing. Very relaxed atmosphere, service was awesome and the food was great. I had soft shell crab with fried green tomato and sunnyside up egg. Seasoned perfectly. Looking forward to going back for dinner. I only gave it 4 stars because there were shells in the crab. I will definitely be going back and soon!","1015":"I was hoping for more Cajun options.  I'm not sure what kind of food this really is.  Trying to be fancy \"southern\" food I guess?  I thought it was ok, but not too special.","1016":"We had the bacon popcorn, ruby trout, crawfish hush puppies and strip steak. Everything was very good! Also enjoyed some house infused cocktails which were delicious as well. Definitely recommend this  place. Service was very efficient too.","1017":"Came in with family. Very cool, unique gastro pub. Superb beer menu and lots of tasty food. Very happy with the service. Will be back!","1018":"This is a weird review for me to write because I actually did not fully enjoy the food that I got at The Parish. This was the first time I had frog legs and The Parish offers them as an appetizer wrapped in bacon. Unfortunately the bacon was very overcooked. Some people like bacon this way but I do not. This is just a personal preference though so others might enjoy this appetizer, especially if they've never had frog legs before.\n\nFor an entree I had the Spicy Haitian Shredded Pork and it was way too spicy. To be fair, my waiter warned me about the spiciness and this could just be my intolerance for extremely spicy foods. Again, this might just be a personal preference. The fries that came with it were very lifeless but the aioli I ordered with them made them much better. \n\nOn the other hand, my wife throughly enjoyed her Shrimp Po'Boy and we both enjoyed our dessert of Chocolate Bread Pudding. I feel like I just picked the wrong appetizer and entree for me which is why I'm giving The Parish an average review.","1019":"Rat's is a restaurant that is good but has potential to improve. \n\nService: Above average. Server was polite but did not intrude on our lunch. Split our checks including tax as well. (4\/5)\n\nLocation: The bread and butter of what makes this restaurant popular. Located in the Grounds for Sculptures complex, ask for outside seating if the weather permits. In addition, you can enter into the complex through the restaurant for convenience. (5\/5)\n\nFood: Food was slightly above average in terms of taste and slightly below average in terms of portion size. We had the trout, paillard, and croquet madam. Taste and size were pretty consistent across all 3 entrees as we all stated the dishes were relatively tasty but on the small side. (3\/5)\n\n Value: On the expensive side but expected for a restaurant located in such a nice location. Entrees during lunch range around $15 - $20. (4\/5)\n\nAmbience: The inside of the restaurant was actually really nice. Dim lighting alongside nice portraits makes for a nice sensual experience while eating. Outside is great as well as long as you can deal with ducks coming up to you begging for food. (5\/5)","1020":"All I've heard about the parish was that it was good food, but let me tell you, its more than that. The service was awesome, the server was very helpful and absolutely made us feel like we were the only table in house even though we were one of many. He was that good and his recommendations were spot on and very objective. The parish burger was fantastic and the flavor profile was so balanced and I dislike blue cheese anything. But its the star of the burger. And my fiance ordered the fish and chips and wasn't disappointed at all. I'll get that next time. And for sure get a corn bread... Don't miss out and go on a Monday so you can really enjoy it. We did!","1021":"The ambieance of this place is beautiful. Settled in Grounds for Sculpture, Rat's is surround by iconic art scenes and offers a full view of Monet's Bridge. My wife and I had just spent several hours touring the grounds and thought we would enjoy some drinks before we wrapped up our day. The website for Rat's said that it closed at 3:30, so we hurried over. We entered the restaurant at 3:13. Even though we entered where it said \"enter\", 5\" there was no host stand, we wondered around the restaurant for a couple of moments and asked a bus boy who directed us to the host stand. It was 3:15 by this point. First they looked at us annoyed as we stood before them. I asked if they were seating and one responded they were closed. I stated their website said they were open for another 15 min. They looked at me blankly. We walked away. If I'm going to buy top dollar drinks, the least the staff can do is honor their website hours and acknowledge you as a valued customer. My advice to management....Fire your three hostesses and promote your bus boy. He grasp customer service 101.","1022":"Fabulous setting. Excellent food. Aesthetic presentation. Charming waitstaff. Special occasion place or nice place to meet friends for lunch. Combine with Grounds for Sculpture.","1023":"Good atmosphere and the food is really really good!  The pulled pork sandwich was amazing!! The hush puppies are worth it!  Ask for their fry's sauce when you order","1024":"I came here a while ago and decided to come back after I was reminded of the place. I thought the place was good last time but couldn't remember too well. After today I'm wondering why it's been so long since I've come back. I got the pulled pork sandwich which was very good. Messy, but very good. The cabbage gives a little crispness that enhances the sandwich. I got the gumbo for a side and it was also very good. \n\nAlthough I didn't get a cocktail, since I had to go back to work, they looked good. I will definitely try one next time.","1025":"Very busy for Saint Patrick's Day. That's to be expected though. Got the Peaches, sweet but the whisky really balances it out. The Drunken Angel has a kick to it. Yum. Bread was tasty. Forget which salad but it had lots of bacon. We had to ask for silver wear and the hostess couldn't tell us the wait time. Which I do understand it's hard to figure a wait time unless you have a computer program to clock the times of each individual table. Other than that would definitely go back!","1026":"I can't say enough good things about this place. On top of them always having fabulous food... Every time the service is spot on as well!!! \nWe recently went in here after a horrendous experience at another restaurant and they saved our date night.\nI love their expansion and late night menu.\nMy goal is to try every single dinner item... At least once!!!! \nI'll be back very very very soon!!!!!","1027":"well,..i don't usually right reviews...but I just wanted to share my experience here.\nI love restaurants with a view,so the seating area outside is amazing ,absolutely in love\nthe food,..whatever,..my salad was horrible,like really horrible,my kids French fries overfried,i mean for a kid not to eat French fries it means it is pretty bad,\nthe desserts,..my cream brule was good,..the chocolate cake with lavender smth . I won't recommend\nbut still the view is so nice that I didn't care about all of it,\nwhat I didn't like is service ,and I am a very chill person\nfirst of all,I maid a reservation,...when we came I said that we want to seat outside,...\nof course I want the table by the water,the waiter tells me no, it is for a happy hour...wtf...\nthe place is half empty,,..so I am standing there like no I want what I want...\nso she finally gave us the table that I wanted ,...and then the waitress was ,...how do I say it, the way she was serving us it's like I am sitting in McDonalds,..\nand they need to do something about those ducks, the thing was harassing my kids,,,first it was cute,but when the whole time u r in the restaurant and the duck is under the table begging for food ,common...it's even snatched chicken finger out of my son's hands\nanyway,...I would still come back,...just because the pond and the flowers,...ahhhh..just magical\nservice sucks","1028":"I am reviewing The Parish as a restaurant.  As a bar with food, it would get a fourth star because the drink selection is above average and well executed.  But as a cajun style food restaurant, the drinks only take you so far and then the food has to take over.  And it just doesn't.\n\nNot that the eats are bad; it's just that they are not special - at least not from the sampling we experienced.  Take the fish and chips -- no, don't.  We didn't.  The fish is tilapia, the poor cousin to the catfish with the mushy consistency.  Don't look for redfish on the menu, or any other traditional Louisiana variety.  What you have is red trout, which isn't bad smoked as an appetizer, and would have been better if there was more than two forkfuls on the $10 plate.  But cajun?  Not really.\n\nMy pulled pork sandwich had average pork which was about the same as what you get at a side-of-the-road BBQ truck, and the gumbo that accompanied it was hot but not flavorful.  I ate them both with a modicum of pleasure, but surely no better than three stars' worth.\n\nThe ambiance is gastropub, with the only New Orleans hint being some pictures on the walls, and the service is fine.  I paid $60 for a good beer and average food for two.  Not quite worth it.","1029":"Nice cozy place, the hushpuppies were AMAZING! My main meal was the trout and it was huge! Nice and moist and perfectly cooked :)","1030":"Had a nice lunch.  The hush puppies are highly recommended. Good place to stop for an Abita beer fix.","1031":"What a fun place!  Jeffery was a terrific server and his suggestions were very helpful. I had the Goat cheese Chili Rellenos appetizer but I should have stopped with that. I don't ear a lot and it was perfect for a meal!  So tasty. Can't wait to have it again. The others had various entrees. All were very good.  Really like coming here","1032":"Ambiance, and of course the Grounds for Sculpure, is delightful. Thus the two stars and not one. The food was sparse and average, at best. Both my wife and I had the Hanger Steak, and it was dry and tasteless. The fries were on par with Burger King. Salads were average. Claimed my gift card had a zero balance, and of course, I didn't argue with them, though it was embarrassing. I used the card the very next day w\/o a problem. Have no idea what their gig was. Very over-priced. You can do better with your $100 +.","1033":"Best place in Tucson for cajun style food. Cocktails are tasty and refreshing. Enjoyed the shrimp and grits with greens and the hush  puppies are authentic.","1034":"We've seen this place several times as it's next to Sushi on Oracle, and always wondered about it. So, what the hay, let's try it. There's some outside seating, but we decided to sit inside. It's not a big place, but decent amount of seating. For a Tuesday, there was still a good amount of people there. That's a plus since I do not like being the only patron in the restaurant.\n\nThey have a pretty good menu selection, but if you're not a pork eater, then beware because a majority of the menu has bacon or some type of pork. And unfortunately the bf doesn't eat pork, which equals limited choices. \n\nThey have a good list of craft beers and interesting infused liqueurs. \n\nOkay, so the food- I had the lamb chorizo flat bread and the bf had the parish burger sans the bacon with fries.\n\nThe lamb chorizo had some really bold flavors- spiced lamb, goat cheese, kalamata spread and some sauce heavily drizzled over everything then garnished with cilantro. I love bold flavor dishes, but this was quite rich! At some point, the cheese and sauce slightly overpowered the lamb, but I guess the beer help cut the richness.\n\nThe parish burger was tasty and it was topped with bleu cheese and an onion marmalade. The sweetness of the marmalade was yummy, but we hoped for a little more bleu cheese. The fries were okay, nothing special. The bf thought they were a little hard.\n\nAll in all nice bold flavor combinations and beer selection. Not bad, and I have high hopes for a gastropub in Tucson. There were some other menu items that piqued my interest, and I'll go again to try other items... maybe not with the bf.","1035":"I shouldn't have been all that surprised, based on the brunch reviews, that this was a thoroughly disappointing experience, but I was. The two stars reflect the fun locale, the tea, and the pancake.\n \nWe did the buffet. I did not make the res, so I don't know if you had to decide ahead of time, but we were never offered a lunch menu or any other options. Our server was completely disinterested in the little bit of service that was expected. We had to ask for coffee and tea. The buffet never had plates at the ready, but no fewer than 3 servers were standing around doing nothing. At one point, the carver left his station to get plates because no one else seemed to care. It took forever for them to refill food items that had run out. And it was not even crowded. \n\nPretty sure the chef did not taste anything. The eggs benedict was terrible, the jerk chicken had no jerk, and so on.  \n\nIn short, don't waste your money, at least for brunch.","1036":"Dropped in for a late Saturday night dinner. The restaurant was cute! The vibe was dark\/moody with lots of burgundy reds and use of church pews as seats. The service was spectacular. The food was pretty tasty: we ordered the cornbread, seafood pasta and fries. The cornbread was great, fell apart in your mouth and came in a cast iron pan. The pasta was delicious, the plate was a bit on the small side but maybe because it was so delicious I kept wanting more. Fries were fries. Would love to revisit sometime!","1037":"First visit last night and was great! Found here on yelp. Bartender Amber provided an excellent recommendation of the Drunken Angel. I also had to try the bacon popcorn based on reviews here. The beer selection was more than expected with plenty of local options. Two tv's in the bar to watch a game. Would definitely go back again.","1038":"Friendly staff, awesome atmosphere!\n\nCornbread was awesome!  Parish burger was awesome!  Gumbo was awesome!  AWESOME!\n\nWould eat there again if it cost me my firstborn.","1039":"Highly disappointed in our meal today.  Did not taste freshly prepared.  We opted not to do the brunch because we felt it was not worth $44\/pp. for a gourmet French place it was very basic.  You cannot even get an iced coffee beverage if you are there for brunch. We will not be returning.","1040":"Ugh, I am so torn about this place.  I also had an issue there regarding service, but the manager did quickly take care of the issue.  While the place is beautiful and the grounds for sculpture is also beautiful the food is so-so. We went for the Sunday brunch.  While the appetizers and desert buffet is amazing, the actual meal was below average and frankly the only thing I could think to describe it was \"bleh.\"  \n\nI agree with the other reviewer in that there is really something wrong with the staff that I can't quite put my finger on. Either they really don't want to be there, or are just completely snobby.  I can't figure it out.","1041":"Great food. Nice decor. The odd, floating head outside from the Grounds For Sculpture kinda throws you a little though.","1042":"I went here with a group of 7 for Mother's Day Brunch, and it's been a while since I've had such a disappointing restaurant experience, partly because it was the most expensive meal I have ever paid for, and partly because the food just wasn't good.\n\nGetting to the location was somewhat challenging.  There were cars going in every which way once you got close, and there were at least 3 or 4 entrances for Grounds for Sculpture.  The correct entrance for the restaurant is the entrance with no signage at all, which would explain why all the cars in our party made at least one wrong turn before figuring it out.\n\nThe ambiance of the room we were sitting was quite nice.  We were in a somewhat private area indoors with a lovely chandelier and decorations, but the tables were a bit packed, causing me to get shoved a number of times before finally moving our table a little bit.  The wait-staff was courteous and professional, and checked in on us a fair amount.\n\nThe issues really came with the brunch buffet itself.  The buffet was set up in an area that seemed to be a commercial kitchen, which happened to be a pretty far away from our table through multiple doors and even going outside.  The buffet area was pretty cramped and somewhat disorganized for how things were set up, and a lot of the areas were pretty messy with spills.  \n\nThe selection was a little disappointing: there wasn't even plain eggs or something like waffles\/pancakes.  My wife, a vegetarian, had trouble finding enough to satisfy her.  Additionally, the food just wasn't good.  The breakfast sausage was gross, the chicken was dry and inedible, the smoked salmon was flavorless, the oysters and clams had a funk to them, the meats from the carving stations were cold and gummy, the bacon was soggy... I could go on and on.  I was able to try so much because I wanted to finish so little.\n\nSo the food wasn't good: big deal right?  Well, for the table of 7 with tax and tip, the bill was over $500.  You kind of expect the food to be at least palatable when you're putting down half a grand for a small party.\n\nHopefully the normal service outside of their brunch buffet is more impressive, but this experience was pretty terrible, and I'm out a lot of money for it.  You can go for Grounds for Sculpture, but steer clear of this restaurant.","1043":"Crazy yummy noshes and groovy ambiance. The chili relleno is a must try. I wish the pork rinds had more spice rather than a wet salsa. But still yum. All the appetizers were great the gumbo a must!","1044":"The drinks are delicious and super creative! Reminded me of a speakeasy with the low lighting and fun old time drink ingredients.","1045":"I hope you win 2017 Tucson Iron Chef :) tasty food, fun drinks, great local art, and friendly staff.","1046":"Nice place for lunch-their $20 deal had a range of choices from fish to vegetarian.    Service was fine.  And i loved the peacocks strutting outside our table side window. As an added plus it is set on 'Grounds for Sculpture' park which has nice walking paths and hundred's of displays (ranging from very nice to so-so).","1047":"The Parish is a treat to explore.  Take advantage of their unique and artfully creative menu options.  And that's not the only thing they've got going for them--the bartenders are just as creative and capable as the culinary staff.  Had a great rum-based cocktail with OJ, and balnced notes of ginger and vanilla.  That drink was outstanding!  I opted for the chipotle-smoked salmon salad because I'm watching my girlish figure--Not for the faint of heart as the flavors are rich and textures are anything but subtle.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Think twice before ordering this entree if you're on a date however--smoked salmon, onions--get the picture?  Put the Parish on your \"to do\" list.  #Toby Keith's bar\/grill is just down the street on Oracle as is Sir Veza's.  Two bars at polar opposites to add to an evening of fun!","1048":"Great food and entertainemt. Loved the vibrant atmosphere. The staff were great and very attentive. The music was fun! Just loud so I couldn't talk to my husband well. But overall it was fun and good yumm!","1049":"Fish and chips, hush puppies and gumbo. Yum.\nFresh oysters disappointing but then my Chesapeake Bay standards may be too high. \nGood service and nice neighborhood vibe.","1050":"The vibe here is great!\nI was in town from Phoenix and looking for a bar with some personality, I found it here. They infuse so many different kinds of alcohol, you can see it all in jars behind the bar. The guy a few seats down ordered the shrimp and grits. It looked and smelled amazing! My friend and I decided to share the Drunken Angel pasta (hello pasta cooked perfectly in Beaudoux wine). So goooood, but soooo rich. I could never finish a bowl by myself. Maybe with a little less sauce it would feel a little lighter in my belly. The flavors and service were spot on. I will absolutely be back next time I'm in Tucson!","1051":"My husband and I last ate at Rat's a few years ago to celebrate a special occasion.  It was a lovely evening -we had delicious vegetarian meals (several options to choose from), enjoyed great service, and then spent an hour or so walking the lovely grounds.  We were hoping to re-live the experience but to be honest, it was nice -but not as good as we had remembered.\n\nPros:\nThe service did not disappoint \nThe appetizers were great -the mezze platter and kale salad were delicious.\nThe ambience is lovely\n\nCons:\nThere was only one vegetarian option\nThe breads\/popovers were a bit dry (perhaps just an \"off\" day)\nBe careful when walking to\/from the restroom -the wait staff zooms around corners at a swift pace.  They are very courteous, but there was more than one instance that I would call a \"close call.\"\n\nOur biggest gripe was that they now charge admission to Grounds for Sculpture for Rat's patrons.  I had double-checked with our waiter that we would be able to walk the grounds after our meal and he said \"of course; until 10pm\" but he neglected to add that they now charge admission.  After spending $120 on our meal, it left a bitter taste to spend an extra $30 to walk around the sculpture garden for half an hour.  \n\nIf the change is in place to prevent folks from sneaking into GFS, perhaps they could offer the wristbands at the end of the meal.  Or, if admission needs to be charged due to strapped finances, then at least offer a discount for Rat's patrons.  Walking around GFS is the main reason why we dine at Rat's, but I don't think we'll be returning with this new charge.","1052":"Rat's is an interesting destination and half the fun is admiring the life like statues along the way and on the grounds. So we elected to sit outside which was nice despite very hard and uncomfortable chairs.  Not knowing their appetizers are enough to feed an army we ordered the cheese platter and the mezze sampler which has 2 styles of hummus, olives and eggplant tapenade. Both were very well presented and tasty though we had to ask for more flat bread for the cheese\nLuckily we decided to split the Halibut which was perfectly cooked and presented with a large prawn, clams and mussels. Overall our experience was positive though some of the staff seemed a bit inexperienced and that's why I gave a four star rating.","1053":"This is our go to for special occasions.   Always a great menu and the decor is beautiful.  Very knowledgeable staff","1054":"Great gastropub.  Been here about 3-4 times and service and food have been fantastic. The pulled pork sandwich,  shrimp and grits,  and burger are all great.\n\nTheir signature drinks are mostly good, service has always been pretty good. The Big Hippie sandwich is delicious, as are the handcuff fries (whether you have as a side or an app) are delicious. Shrimp and grits were amazing when I had them, the grits were cooked perfectly and the BBQ-cream sauce was fantastic.","1055":"Excellent service and awesome delicious menu. They also have a good bar, large patio, specialty drinks and color dining room. You won't be disappointed or leave hungry here.","1056":"Food was great. Service was ok, but where faulty, apologized for by super nice manager.","1057":"Where do I even start... My family and I came here on a Sunday to celebrate my graduation. The place itself is pretty unique, however, I was a bit confused by the mix of French, English and Middle Eastern decor since the place is supposed to be strictly \"French.\" The waitress we had was a bit snobby and didn't make us feel welcome, probably because we didn't understand half of the food on the list. We started with the French onion soup which was average at best, but I will give them the benefit that the cheese on top was really good. It also took a half hour to actually get it. \n\nThe entrees were interesting, to say the least, but they also took another 45 minutes to come out. I ordered the Wild boar and what can I say, it was a bore. Very little flavor and I was just happy that my meat was cooked properly. My dad had burnt onions on his Ruben sandwich and mom had an amazing hodgepodge of extremely bitter vegetables. My girlfriend had some mushroom dish that was supposed to have oysters, however we couldn't find a single oyster. \n\nI actually looked around to see if I was crazy or if everyone else was just delusional, suffice it to say everyone else was delusional. Basically people see these unique but terribly put together dishes coupled with overpricing and lie to themselves that it was good so they don't feel completely robbed. I will never come here again and they should be happy that they are located at Grounds for Sculptures or else they would have been out of business years ago.","1058":"I don't normally give 5 stars but when I do it's for a reason! Great food, service and atmosphere! If your in the area the Parish is a must!","1059":"This place is firing on all cylinders - nice atmosphere, live entertainment fitting the setting and great food.  Skillet cornbread, bacon popcorn, shrimp and grits - all excellent.  Highly recommend ....","1060":"My wife and I have dined here on a few special occasions.  The food has always been exceptional, and interesting.  It's very expensive, of course, but I never have left with buyer's remorse.","1061":"Interesting setting for a restaurant as its located at the base of grounds for sculpture. The food is quite good. The New England clam chowder was outstanding. I also really liked the rainbow trout which was served in a maple-esque sauce with veggies and almonds. The bloody mary was awesome. It was served in cucumber vodka. I wouldn't get the salmon. It lacked flavor and character. I would also shy away from the chocolate souffle as it was very shallow. It should be much richer.","1062":"I'm from Louisiana and I am so impressed! This is the real deal! \nCute and quaint....great blues tunes....can't wait until it cools down to come sit on the patio. We had crawfish hushpuppies-crispy outside perfect inside....yum! The gumbo is so good....not as soupy as I'm used to but if you like a thick roux and explosion of flavors...on point! Ok....the shrimp po-boy....OMG! I had to ask where the bread was from because I thought It was from Gambinos! Crunchy outside\/soft inside, shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the extras on it were just right. Drink and beer menu is excellent. And.....they serve Crystal hot sauce!!","1063":"Went for brunch on a Sunday. Offerings were sparse, only a few tables, and they were a disaster - a complete mess. Price is outrageous for what you get. Staff is nice but this doesn't make up for the deficits. $100 would be better spent elsewhere. Very disappointing. Need to step it up Rat's!","1064":"Found this place on Yelp while in town for a conference. Great food (we had gumbo and po boy) and frosty beers. Can't wait to go back and try some of the specialty cocktails!","1065":"If You Are desiring the Best Brunch in All of New Jersey RATS is a hidden Treasure. The Food and Experience is Top Notch. A celebrated Sunday with Jazz Band and the most amazing food for your pallet. After Brunch take a stroll through the gardens of Sculpture. Enjoy!","1066":"What a terrific place!!  Some of the best food,  I promise you ! It's  a cleverly thought out menu with a touch of southern flare. Great choices that aren't your everyday  selection.  Sweet tea brined pork chops... Yummy! Crawfish hush puppies!  They infuse their own house liquors!  Wow,  you have to try these! Everything has been excellent!! \n   They have musicians come play,  and it's a great selection!  They do get busy,  so check first if you need a reservation, believe me, it's worth it!  I recommend this place all the time!   Definitely add this to your dinner list of places to go.  \n  Oh!  Each year they do an awesome Mardi Gras event!! So much fun!","1067":"We had a gathering of about 30 people for happy hour. The service was fast, efficient, and gracious and the snacks and drinks were yummy and priced right. Great experience.","1068":"A great night out for our anniversary, with a few minor stumbles.  First, the decor....it's spectacular.  I remarked as we entered that the facade reminds me of being in Disney--in a good way!  The inside of the restaurant is soothing and interesting and right to my taste, with a lot of beams and stone and rustic wooden furniture.  Instead of one large room, it is separated into various alcoves, making the dining experience a lot more intimate.  The armchairs at the tables are padded and are very comfortable and the tables are large.  \n\nWe had 8:15 reservations and arrived promptly; however, our table was not ready. The very solicitous maitre'd led us to the bar, which was cozy and charming but fills up very fast as it is not that spacious.  I ordered a Grey Goose and Grapefruit, but the juice was pink grapefruit juice cocktail (i.e., sugar with a hint of juice).  For the exorbitant price of the drinks ($12 range), they should at least serve real juice!  \"Luckily\" my glass had a chip on the rim.  We told the bartender, who apologized profusely, and started to make me another.  At that point, we asked if he didn't have any real juice; he said he had grapefruit nectar that they save for another type of cocktail but he pulled it out of the fridge and asked if I would like to try my drink with it.  I did, and it was delicious.\n\nWe were seated shortly thereafter.  The wait staff too is extremely solicitous and offer up suggestions readily.  We were given an amuse bouche of chilled gazpacho in cute little square glasses; it was very refreshing, if a tiny bit heavy on the onion.  Warm popovers served with herb butter were a huge hit; they are a very nice, light touch.\n\nThe appetizers clearly are the stars at Rat's.  A jumbo lump crab cocktail with pink grapefruit (real this time!), mango, chiles, pea tendrils, and an amazing citrus avocado dressing was one of the best plates I have ever had.  The crab was sweet and the textures of the vegetables were varied; some soft, and some crunchy.  The asparagus and morel mushroom salad too was delightful; lightly dressed and fresh, with a nice woodsy taste from the morels.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the crispy lobster, and the steak au poivre (the latter recommended by our waiter). The lobster was cooked very well, but the light (I'm guess tempura) batter on the bottom side was a little soggy, and the gingery glaze (which did not taste of ginger, oddly enough) was a little overpowering for the delicate shellfish.  The trumpet mushrooms in the dish had an odd texture and were bland.  The dish was a little too rich somehow, and didn't seem all that cohesive.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful and peppery, and the accompanying pomme frites were amazing.  The only downside to the dish was an over-dressed and overly salty baby arugula salad.  And they need to invest in real steak knives!  We also had a \"side order\" of the mushroom and pea risotto, which was a little soupy and watered-down for our taste.  I have watched enough Top Chef to know that this dish is supposed to be soupy rather than able to stand up on its own (which is how I made it at home, honestly), but this lacked a creaminess I have come to expect from the dish, and it also would have benefited from added Parmesan.  The portions are on the smallish side but are decent.\n\nFor dessert, we had a caramelized brioche \"custard\" with apple confit and orange sorbet; though the waiter referred to it as a type of bread pudding, it was so much more and was absolutely scrumptious, with a nice boost of cinnamon.  We also ordered the sorbet\/ice cream sampler; we chose pear sorbet, orange sorbet, and caramel ice cream. They were all delicious, with the blue ribbon going to the pear.  The staff wrote HAPPY ANNIVERSARY on the plates in chocolate, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe pace of the evening was perfect...leisurely and relaxed.  The prices are high, especially for New Jersey, but with the quality of the food, I guess they are in line.  We would definitely go back for a special occasion, and would recommend that others looking for a magical night out consider Rat's at well.","1069":"This was our third trip to Rats.  Comforting ambiance.. The food and selections were excellent and the service was pleasant and efficient. We like to show up early and go to the bar. So neat. The entire place is beautiful, inside and out. We will go back as soon as the weather turns warmer so we can enjoy the grounds.","1070":"My favorite part about this restaurant  is definitely the view. The service was good and the dry aged sirloin I ordered was very tasty. The steak was cooked to my liking medium - rare. Very tender and delicious. I urge you to visit during dinner hours. The ambiance is quite pleasing. Definitely a nice place for a date or if you're just in the area looking for a nice restaurant to visit. Also their drinks are not too shabby!","1071":"It's located within the grounds for sculpture.. for that alone I was already a fan.\n\nThe food although pricey was tasty and as previously stated timed perfectly.\n\nThe staff was completely friendly and helpful.\n\nA beautiful location for a first date, business event or even a leisurely luncheon with an afternoon spent exploring the old fairgrounds estate.\n\nI'll happily go back another day.","1072":"The food quality seems very good here. I am only giving them 3 stars due to the following reasons. There is not a lot choices on their menu that isn't seafood or spicy. The waiter forgot my friends order. She only orders 1 thing the bacon popcorn. She did share it with the table and she was complaining it wasn't as good as it usually is. There was not much of a bacon taste and some of the popcorn was burnt. I ordered a side salad and burger. The side salad had fresh greens and was a generous portion. The burger had excellent flavor.","1073":"I had a date here a few weeks ago and it was my first time visiting.  It's a perfect place to meet someone at the bar for a little a happy hour.   They only offer one Chardonnay by the glass and it was pretty good.  The highlight of the evening (besides the company :)) were the mussels!  OMGshh they were so delicious.  And the bread that comes with is perfectly crisp and perfect for dipping :)  They had some construction going on so business must be going well if they're expanding. I will definitely be back.","1074":"Great for our wedding ceremony and reception. \n\nCeremony: in the Pavilion. Reception: up stairs on the Landing and Boncompain. We opted for the morning wedding, early afternoon reception.\n\nChris Carrel organized it with us. He had a great attention to detail and helped us throughout the entire process. \n\nAnd of course the food was delicious and relatively fast (considering we placed close to 60 orders within 1.5 hours). \n\nOther Notes:\n\nGreat opportunities for photos.\nGuests can enjoy the Grounds for Sculpture (which is a trip in itself).\nHelpful, enthusiastic staff (for our wedding at least, the actual restaurant staff were not as knowledgeable of the events and accidentally lead some of our guest astray right before the wedding. It happens...)\nLots of ducks and peacocks.\nNo decoration required. Beautiful just the way it is. \n\nHealth Notes:\n\nProbably friendly to paleo and ketogenic dieters. I had a salmon dish with veggies. The staff and chefs at Rat's are happy to modify dishes for allergens or vegetarians.","1075":"I loved the ambiance but it is a smallish restaurant\/bar. The drinks were fantastically fun and the couple I tried where just the right balance of flavor and booze without too much sugar as some cocktails are apt towards. Because it was a Friday evening there was a bit of a delay in getting a table but there was some indoor seating for my friend and I to enjoy our cocktails.\n\nBecause we are both a little on the adventurous side of gourmet we decided to try the frog legs, they were a little salty for my taste but fun regardless. I had a delicious fish dish for my main course and left very satisfied. Service was great and despite a busy Friday we were able to have a relaxed evening of catching up. \n\nWe did leave before the band set up, I am grateful because otherwise I think we would have been in direct line of the speakers. However I could see coming back to the bar for an nightcap and some live music to be an added bonus for this side of town.","1076":"Our first visit to Grounds for Sculpture with a highly anticipated reservation at Rats. Appetizers were fantastic. Very disappointed with our entrees. After reviewing reviews we were excited to order the sirloins as they received kudos. Not what we expected. A $50 steak should never be gristly and tough.  While we were offered another it kind of loses its thrill. Will probably enjoy the grounds again but will not re visit Rats.","1077":"We stayed at Loews Ventana Canyon and came down for dinner one night.  The Parish is a great little spot.  We shared the pretzel fondue which was pretty tasty and then saved the spicy cheese dip for our fries (that was the best part!). I had a great burger and my husband got an oyster sandwich.  The food and service was good. We would hit this place up again.","1078":"There are hardly words to describe the excellence of the food and service at Rat's.  We recently experienced our annual visit for \"Dinner and a Stroll\" at Rat's and the Grounds for Sculpture.  Each course (and the numerous little surprises) was delectable.  The staff was so hospitable -- we all felt like we were cherished guests.  The setting, cuisine and care made for a magical evening.","1079":"This place is one of the greatest spots in Tucson. I don't write yelp reviews but I feel like I have to say something about this wonderful Tucson gem. The food is, by far, some of the best you'll find. I am lucky to live fairly close, but it is worth any amount of travel to get to The Parish. Some of my favorites are the Drunken Angel, The Chop and the Fish and Chips. There is one item on the menu that wins over everything though, The Alabama Quail. This dish is, by far, top three of the best food I've had in this town. The combination of flavors is out of this world. The quail is perfectly cooked every time and the grit cake is a piece of heaven! You. Must. Eat. Alabama Quail.\nEqually amazing, the cocktails. The Parish's drink menu has something for everyone. The Front Porch Tea is so delicious. It's mint, lemon juice, green tea and peach vodka. I can't get enough of it. They have a great drink called the Carribean Mule, it uses a vanilla ginger rum, that they infuse at the bar, and they finish it by flaming the top of the drink. Totally tasty. The bartenders are a gas. They're always doing something fun and love to talk about what they're doing behind the bar. They're great to chat with and it's so fun to watch them work. I usually see Nate or Loren when I go, but Stephanie is a new addition and she is great too. When I sit in the restaurant I try to get Maureen's section. She is so sweet and takes great care of us. Her sugestions have never steered us wrong. She's the best.\nYou will love this place. Go and have a great time. Sit at the bar, if you can, and get Nate to do some magic for you or tell you a joke. That guy's hilarious. If you can't get to the bar, ask for Maureen, you can't go wrong!\nI hope The Parish has a long life, if they keep doing things the way they are now, they'll be around forever!","1080":"The food was fabulous And just the right portions. The waiter was very helpful in his suggestions. Excellent place to visit.","1081":"Alexis was a great server!\n\nBacon Popcorn started us off and led to the Wonderful Grilled Trout w\/ Delicious Greens, then finishing with the Smore Cake.","1082":"Loved the food and the wonderful service at Rat's ... It was the cherry on top of a terrific day at the Grounds for Sculpture. French Onion soup rocked and the sandwich \"lunch special\" was great!  I couldn't finish my sandwich so I asked to have it wrapped to go ... and it was handed to me in foil that was shaped like a cartoon \"rat\" ...  very clever.\nIf you're looking for a great day trip, take the tour of the \"Grounds\" and make reservations for lunch at Rat's ... you won't be disappointed. And don't forget your camera!!","1083":"Have been going since they first opened. Never disappointed and owe this place a review. Good food, good drink, very fun menu. Always new stuff. Although I miss the pit bbq wings, bring those back! Very helpful and friendly staff and owners, chef, etc. Top down quality you can tell starts at the top. \n\nBacon popcorn, crafts, Dutch well water among the favorites. I typically go for an app and drink but have to check them out for dinner. Oh and decent coffee if your the one driving :)","1084":"I absolutely love love love this frigging place!\nThe food is absolutely delicious, the decor is quirky and fun, service is excellent and the beer selection is decent as well!\nThe PO Boys are off the chain good, the Jambalaya, the Gumbo, Red Beans and Rice, and Crawfish are amazing as well!\nBacon Wrapped Frog Legs, need I say more,ok I will Bacon Pop Corn!\nThis in my opinion is one of the best restaurants in Tucson!\nAbsolutely recommend!","1085":"Ate there two nights ago, French onion soup terrible, didn't taste like onion soup, grilled octopus way over salted.  Patio ambiance great, but food not worth the price.","1086":"Cool environment. Great menu selection and unique drinks combine to make The Parish a great hangout spot in Tucson. The staff is friendly and fun times are always had when I stop by.","1087":"They have amazing craft cocktails and they infuse with different flavors.  Bartender was super fun and we liked watching him mix.  Also had the baked and fresh oysters and couldn't believe how large they were.  The hand cut fries are a must have too.","1088":"Had the drunken pasta.  It was OK\/good.  I got bored of the meal halfway through and left a bit hungry.  I've had similar pastas at many other restaurants and usually preferred theirs.  Probably a good choice for Tucson which has few good restaurants so 4 stars vs 3 stars if somewhere else.","1089":"A New Jersey gem. Thanks for introducing me to this place Steven hump. Sitting pond side of monet bridge with koi fish is a delight","1090":"I fell in love with this place instantly after having the \"pit\" wings.  They were some of the best wings I have ever had.  Then when I didn't things could get any better my gumbo and hush puppies came out.  I am from New Orleans and let me tell you The Parrish gumbo is as good as my mom's.  \n\nService was solid and friendly.  They have Abita on tap.  \n\nThey have the trifecta working for them.\nGREAT FOOD, GOOD SERVICE, TASTY BEER","1091":"5 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for food itself, and 3 stars for wishing the menu had some more traditional choices, ... overall, I love this place though. Rat's is like escaping to another world for a while - and if you claim the Moroccan pillows by the fireplace, even better.\nThe food is bit pricey, so go for lunch to save a little money, or just know this is for special occasions. Happy hour is fantastic, and you can make a meal of sampling half-price apps. \nThe menu is french-inspired, but you can get a decent burger or something \"safe\" if you need to. Vegetarians may have even more limited options, but they are accommodating if you need something adjusted. The Wild Boar Ragout is full of rich flavor, definitely vote for that. I'm not a fan of duck, so I just wish they pulled back on the references to \"duck fat\" - but again, it's french... :) \nThe restaurant is quiet, and usually the bar is quiet too, but can get loud when it's packed.","1092":"This place ruins the beautiful and special place that is around it. (1) Loud, 1980s pop music blaring from speakers embedded in the plants surrounding the most peaceful pond and sculptures. Enough to give me indigestion anywhere. (2) They want to offer a tasting menu? Gimme a break. They can't even cook a steak right - ours was tough and overdone, and fries obliterated in old oil. I actually had a stomach ache en route back to NYC. Lovely, friendly waitstaff, and beautiful decor.  With management that understands what a gem they have in the sculpture garden and offers a, this place could become famous.  But our experience was so bad that we will not return, despite the amazing sculpture garden.","1093":"I really had a great time here, and was quite impressed! The ambiance decor was great! The food was really good! They seemed like they had a few quirks to get out, but I did go awhile ago, ago so maybe it's better now. Great addition to the neighborhood!","1094":"Went on Saturday night and once we actually found the place, it was like going into a different world.  The decor outside and in are unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Very cool.  We found ourselves just looking around and smiling like little kids.\n\nWe got there a little early and, as our table wasn't ready yet, we were escorted to the bar.  The bar room is pretty wild.  You walk through the restaurant which is rustic and well appointed into what almost feels like a classy Moroccan Hookah Bar. This is by no means a knock, it was very tasteful and pleasant.  After waiting a little longer than I'd like for a drink, the hostess promptly came to show us to our table.  We were taken upstairs to a small room with only 5 or 6 tables in it.  Other than being a little drafty and chilly was very quaint and cozy.  I also liked it because the downstairs was full it was a little on the loud side and this room was very quiet.   \n\nNow for the important stuff, the food.  We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings, as we try to whenever possible.  It started with an Ahi and Spanish Bakala tartar that I thought was very good.  I love ahi, but in this dish the bakala actually stood out as the star.  My GF got a bit with an excessive amount of olive which really over powered the fish but once she picked around the olive pieces it was all good.\n\nThis was followed by a giant scallop served over barley.  This was the only course I was worried about as I generally don't like scallops.  I am a convert.  This was really really good.  \n\nThe wine that was served with this, neither of us liked.  It was a white Bordeaux and was just not particularly tasty at all.  My description was that it tasted leafy.  I know that's not an standard wine flavor descriptor but its the best I could come up with.\n\nThe next course was duck with pear and hazlenut reduction.  Excellent!  I love duck and the chef treated it exactly how it should be.  The meat was medium rare but the small layer of outer fat was crispy and delicious and the associated sauce was just right.  I would have loved some more of this.\n\nWe then got our cheese course, which is often hit or miss.  This was a hit.  It was, if I remember right, an unpasteurized sheep's milk cheese.  It was great.  It was served with glazed raisins and cranberries that complemented the cheese remarkably well.\n\nThe desert was a relatively safe chocolate creme that was good but not much to write about.\n\nMy only criticisms of the whole experience were the wine pairings and the cost.  The wines weren't as well matched as many others I have had at other restaurants.  As I didn't see any other reviews of it, I wonder if its a new thing for Rat's.  There was only one wine, The Prisoner, that I can say was worth noting.  I liked that a lot.  All the others were just... eh.  And as far as the cost, it was about 40 dollars more per person than Elements in Princeton at which we had a very similar meal a few weeks earlier (better here though).  I don't mind paying for quality though so it didn't bother me too much.\n\nAll in all I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and I will certainly be returning, hopefully sooner than later.","1095":"This was a good place for a date night.  The food and drinks were delicious.  The service was good.","1096":"We went to the annual Rats Halloween party on Friday night.  Upon entering we were met by two rude women. The place was pleasantly packed by people with amazingly creative costumes.  Now for the bar, not enough bartenders at either bar. The main bar was manned with only two bartenders with 5 deep waiting for libations.  The taller bartender was working feverishly to service the Rats customers, but the shorter bartender was rude, angry, confused, and down right obnoxious.","1097":"Oh I can't tell how much I love their pork chop!!! Pork chop is always at the top of the list when I want to order something at a new place. And their pork chop is, definitely, the best.","1098":"Brunch buffet.  Came here from NYC for my dad's 61st birthday (as my parents are still residents nearby).\n\nThis was mediocre.  I heard the lamb was the most impressive, but didn't have it myself so perhaps my rating is a bit lower than it should be.\n\nThis is supposed to be a French style restaurant, but I didn't really notice this...  There was an omelet station which was reminiscent of my college dining hall experience.  There some hot and cold foods, but nothing really memorable.  The cold foods didn't seem cold enough.  Room temperature cocktail shrimp and lox aren't my jam, but overall, I was happy to be in good company. \n\nSide note: there was an open bag of pretzel twists and a squished cockroach on the bathroom floor.  While I'm SURE most restaurants that I've eaten at have frequent cockroach visitors, I don't like to be reminded of it!  \n\nI would still come here again, since it's a nice location.  We really enjoyed walking around grounds for sculpture.  I had such a nice relaxing time with my family that the mediocre food was hardly remembered.  On my next trip, I'd go for the a la carte menu.  $49\/pp for really mediocre brunch is too much.  My parents starved themselves to make the brunch worth it.","1099":"If your in the Tucson area and want a great dinning experience, be sure and stop by \"The Parish\" not only great signature burger but my wife got the \"Crispiest Fish & Chips in the World\" 10's all around service, atmosphere, FOOD (for sure). I am a food snob and unashamed of it (germ-a-phobe) and this place is dope!","1100":"The place is absolutely charming but the food was not up to its eating. The frittata tasted at it had been microwaved and the ham was beyond salty! \n\nI was disappointed since I have been there may times prior.","1101":"Really cool place with great food. Just hoping they add fried green tomatoes, and maybe some  gator","1102":"Great place! Food and drink selection are solid. Brings something unique to Tucson. But tonight, one election day observation: the bartender should keep his rude, vulgar, small-minded political views to himself. I'm not afraid of hearing f#$& but leave Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton conspiracy theories at home.","1103":"I had the oyster po' boy, which was really good. My husband's fish and chips was flaky and the breaking was just right. We were offered a treat since it was hubby's birthday, but decided to have drinks. They make their own infused liquors, and they are yummy! You must try this place!","1104":"This is my favorite place to go! Such a Great spot. Service is always so friendly and quick. They have great music that isn't too loud for dining in. The owners are always walking around checking on people which I love. One of the first times my husband and I went there, we had our 6month old with us and there was a 30 min wait. He was a very unhappy baby and I think the owner saw the exhaustion on our faces... He quietly asked us if we'd like to use the private dining room since it would give us a little breathing room and we could sit right away. A gesture like that to new parents meant so much and we were so relieved. Really great people there!","1105":"Took a friend for his 50th birthday. We walked the grounds- had such a good time. I am sure the bottle of champagne I had before then helped. we had some 'fun' in the grounds and took a bunch of photos. We then had a nice dinner in the less formal area- he was in that mood. After we took over the floor seating by the fireplace with a few after dinner drinks. What a good time and service was great- bartender was great.  I just reminded myself to go back!!!!","1106":"Great atmosphere inside and out. Outside is Grounds For Sculpture, where the sculptures are sometimes embedded in the sculpture garden or right in your face. Inside is an old chateau with art on the walls and sculpture in the nooks. We were seated side by side in a half circle booth, white tablecloths, friendly, accomodating servers. French cuisine that was both interesting and alluring, but me being conservative I had the vegetable soup for starters, served with ciabatta bread and garlic & chive butter, then the trout almandine with roasted potatoes and green beans for the entree, and finally for dessert, which has a copper embossed menu cover, we had the coconut rice pudding with fresh mangoes and mango sorbet...wow. We didn't have any of their fancy mixed drinks. Love the place.","1107":"I have been to Rat's several times. Throughout the last year, I have noticed the service going down. This past weekend, the service was very average. We decided to sit at the bar for a quick meal, I asked for water, and then after ordering my meal asked for a drink. The drink never arrived, the bartender was too busy chatting with another couple, therefore did not make the drink and forgot about it. So I just never got the drink. \n\nI found the food to be very bland in flavor. This was very surprising because having been to Rats before, I used to rave about the food. Very disappointed. The meat was dry, the portion much smaller. Finally, I ordered the panacotta, very nicely displayed, however, there was no flavor. I could not even finish it. I was really surprised. \n\nRats used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I am extremely disappointed about the changes that have been happening there. Unfortunately, it is evident from other reviewers that the quality of this restaurant is declining.","1108":"Wont ever go there...tried several times to reserve for a professional office lunch but wasnt successful. many excuses. arrogant attitudes-they were just \"too busy\" and said we'd need to reserve a year ahead--really? When explaining we had a small group of us (9) from a doctors office &  that we wanted a nice area so we could exchange small gifts at the luncheon we were scolded over the phone telling us we would have to be \"quiet\" if we wanted to eat there. very high and mighty attitudes -- do not get our votes. We are professionals who wanted a nice french meal for the office personel...where'd they get the idea we were less than that? and to tell us our table would be too small is awful...theres a \"french\" restaurant elsewhere and I will find it!!!  The other reviews are interesting too. Nothing is worth being snubbed even before we got there.\nAND its The Wind in the Willows folks, not Disneyland. seems Mr. Johnson loved the story and patterned his restaurant after that theme.. shame, it could be cool if he had a better grip on real folks. When youre a multimillionaire I guess it doesnt matter ........","1109":"We went here for our anniversary and the weather cooperated so we ate outside which was very nice for the exception of the ducks. We sat outside and some little girls were feeding the ducks so needless to say duck poop all over the patio. The  place is very well decorated and nice atmosphere but just beware of the duck poop. So now to the food we had the hanger steak which was not bad cooked just right. Unfortunately my dinner was the wild boar with polenta which was very tasteless and minimal meat. My son had the burger and said it was good, we had two appetizer cheese platter and fresh mozzarella that were good as well. We walked around afterwards and enjoyed some of the sculptures so overall not a bad day. The place is overpriced so I will come back and stick to the lunch items like burgers, salads and sandwiches.","1110":"Stopped by to basically check out the decor. Had a glass of wine and a delicious cheese plate at the bar,  and brought it outside to one of the little high top tables to eat.  Incredible experience.  The waterfall,  the Monet inspired water lilies and bridge, all breathtaking.  You can even check out a few sculptures if you didn't have time to check out the full Grounds of Sculpture exhibits.  All of the waiters and staff are incredibly friendly.  I can't wait to take my mom here for her birthday. I didn't even feel like I was still in NJ! Absolute must see restaurant.","1111":"Excellent. Went here for lunch with my family and we all thought this place was delicious. Started out with bacon popcorn (yes BACON popcorn) and it was phenomenal, we devoured it. My dad and brother got burgers and they both thought they were cooked well and were super flavorful. My mom got a salmon salad that was very fresh and she enjoyed it. I got their \"Drunken Angel\" pasta and it was out of this world- crawfish and shrimp with a delicious burgundy flavored pasta- would highly recommend. The Parish has a southern\/Cajun flair with staples like gumbo and po boys, very tasty but they have something on the menu for everyone. Service was spot on and & waitress was super friendly and timely. Little bit on the pricey side but doable for lunch and the food is worth it. Definitely want to come back for their drink menu and happy hour. Without a doubt would come back to this local gem!","1112":"Good service! Tasty food. Little overpriced for portion size, but cool little place. Would visit again. My family got lots of seafood. They enjoyed it. My burger was delicious. The hush puppies were soooooooo yummy. Fun times! Will visit again next time we are in Tucson.","1113":"Awesome place.  Been many times and worth it!  Worth the walk around the Grounds as well.","1114":"I really wanted to give it a 5 star but...\n\nMy expectations were a bit high on the Cajun side of the house.  The restaurant was more creole than Cajun.  \nThe d\u00e9cor was super cute! sat at the bar and my drink, Hibiscus Sorrell was thirst quenchingly (is that even a word?) good.\n\nI specifically wanted the shrimp and grits, however when I got my plate, the grits were fried, FRIED...NOT creamy like I like my shrimp and grits....Lots of shrimp and sauce.  on the same plate I was served the collard greens which....just.... didn't pair well with the cream sauce of the shrimp.  I suppose had it been served on the side as to not run the flavors together, I would have been more apt to LOVE it.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it, in fact, i had so much food left over that I took it home.  The next day I had it for dinner, made me some instant quick grits, and served it over that, HOLY BATMAN, that's when I LOVED IT!!!\n\nOh the rest of the family ate Gumbo, serving size was good for two people accompanied by 4 or 5 hushpuppies.  Hushpuppies were good, nice and brown on the outside and good and moist in the inside (hush it...) \nThe hub ordered  the steak and fries which was drenched in creamy gravy on top of the Thick cut fries.  After he ate the steak, he was left with \"poutine\" .  Took it home and ate it for lunch the next day, it was even better!\nNOW, the bacon popcorn was the bomb shiznazzee!!! popped in bacon grease served with bacon bits... HOT DAMN!!!! I can eat this while listening to the live musician singing country.  You will definitely and naturally try and lick the bacon grease\/flavor off your fingers.\n\nI will come back and order the gumbo for me to taste.","1115":"Have you ever been to that perfect restaurant, where everything on the menu is up your alley, everything smells amazing, the staff is over the top friendly, and there are microbrews on draft for happy hour?  If you haven't had that experience yet, stop what you're doing and get here!\n\nWe started with the frog legs, not because we needed an appy (because there was more than enough with our entrees) but because they were wrapped in bacon.  Yes, bacon wrapped frog legs with the perfect sauce for dipping like you're at a Cajun tailgate party for the New Orleans Saints Super Bowl game in NOLA!\n\nThen the entrees, big bowl of mussels and drunken angel pasta.  I think they came with 5 baguettes.  More food than one human could consume, not for a lack of effort.\n\nCome, sit, let them treat you.  In the words of The Governator- \"I'll be back\"","1116":"I'm a huge fan of good cajun food, but I've been here twice and was underwhelmed both times.    The decor is trendy.  The adobo pork sandwich didn't taste great (though it was spicy), although there was nothing specifically wrong with it.  I had noodles another time that were neither authentic nor very tasty.  The hush puppies were fantastic, and the gumbo was pretty good.  I think it's a bit overrated, and a little overpriced.  The beer selection is okay, but it's not that good.","1117":"Located right next to the Seward Johnson sculpture ground with marvelous outside courtyard based on Monet's paintings. However the interior decor and lighting looked quite dim and the statues inside could be a bit freaky. Pleasant seating beside the pool with lovely ducks walking all around. Had the Moroccan lamb stew, tender pieces of lamb generously seasoned and cooked thoroughly, literally melting in the mouth. The waitress successfully convinced us to order a round of ice cream and sorbet; ice creams were excellent, and the sorbets had a....somewhat intriguing flavor profile (black pepper strawberry???). Overall, satisfied.","1118":"I came here with a group of 7 to celebrate a birthday.  We were seating upstairs at a big round table in a lovely room.  We shared the olive\/hummus platter which was pretty good and quite large. Some family members had the lobster bisque which they said was rich and creamy. I had the French onion soup which was delicious and not too salty. Various main dishes were ordered with the highlight being the filer mignon. The duck was also satisfying.  I has the lamb which was well cooked, however it came with a cassoulette which had beans in it, which it didn't say on the menu. It was inedible for me.  My mom asked for a hamburger which was not on their dinner menu. We once came for lunch and it was one of the best burger we've ever had. They agreed to make it special for her. When it came out it was still raw. They were very understanding and took it back to the kitchen. Unfortunately by the time it came out again everyone else was done their meal so she had it wrapped to go. One if the managers came over and apologized and took the burger off the bill.  Although unfortunate, it was handled exceptionally well by the restaurant. The highlight of the meal was dessert. My brother ordered the donuts and shared with the table. My mom has gone as far as to say they are the best donuts she's ever had. They came with a few sauces for dipping which everyone loved.  Overall the food was pretty good and the service was great. It is a high priced nice restaurant that is great for special events. I'm sure we will be back.","1119":"The atmosphere is amazing, it was quite different compared to other places around the neighborhood. I was very surprised to see that they had boiled peanuts, but they were still a little hard. I got the drunken angle which was Burgundy angel hair noodles, with a cream sauce and shrimp,crawfish. The waitress did warn me that it was going to be a nutty taste. But I didn't anticipate how Netty it was. The waitress did come to check on how it was but I think was getting the vibe that I liked it. I was thrown off by the dish and unable to complete it. I didn't wanna send it back so I just thanked her and paid my bill. I will return but next time for brunch.","1120":"Amazing view of the park from our outdoor table. But it is not fair that the restaurant gets good reviews due to the beautiful  park. The menu is very limited, the food came out cold and unseasoned. The waitress was nice but could not help too much in this situation. Prices are on the high side too.","1121":"I was originally planning to go to Sushi on Oracle but they were closed. I decided to go next door and give Parish another try. The food was really good this time and the bartender John was really great! Overall had a much better experience this time around.","1122":"7 years ago, I proposed to my wife at Grounds for Sculpture and took her to Rat's. I don't remember what I ate, but I know I also ordered dessert, and the food was phenomal. Also the decor and atmosphere were beautiful. It was definitely pricey, but it was worth it. I can't recommend Rat's highly enough.","1123":"I came here for a yelp event yesterday and the food was delicious. We were lucky enough to try their new menu for fall before it was established. For an appetizer I got the tuna tartar. The tuna tasted very fresh and there was a good amount on my plate. I thought the dish was a little heavy on the garlic. I'm not a fan of fresh garlic but some people like it. For an entree I ordered the duck with grilled fennel with mustard seed and sichuan peppercorn. The duck was cooked perfectly with a crispy layer of fat. The sauce was tangy and salty and went really well with the fat on the duck breast. The duck breast was a sizable amount and the restaurant definitely wasn't skimping out on meat. For dessert I got the cherry olive oil cake. I usually don't order cake at restaurants because they come out dry and bland, but this cake was deliciously moist and didn't have an overpowering olive oil flavor. I also had a blood orange cocktail that was really delicious. I usually don't like mixed drinks because bars will go heavy on the alcohol and I'm not a fan of the taste of alcohol. Rat's did not put in too much alcohol and you could enjoy the blood orange flavor because of this. Overall, it was a very good meal and I will be back next time I need to go to a fancy restaurant. It's conveniently located within driving distance to my house.","1124":"Too greasy, too fattening, too salty and too much bacon.  But, it is an attractive place!","1125":"My wife and I enjoyed a terrific lunch at Rat's. The restaurant is very quaint and very clean. The servers were helpful and professional.  The ambience is relaxing, with views into the Grounds for Sculpture.  We enjoyed a tasty cheese plate, Smoked Salmon Rillette and a  generous salad.  After lunch, we enjoyed the sculpture garden a great deal (which requires a ticket purchase).  A very nice experience for a summer afternoon!","1126":"This place rocks! Great drinks, food, service! Tried a couple different meals and they all rocked! Great happy hour deals!","1127":"Although the place is very formal like, I expected much more of the food. They have a set menu so if anything they should perfect it. The bar area has a nice cozy feel. I especially like the idea that you can go to the Grounds of Sculpture with glass a wine and leave it at a designated area. I guess you would have to add all the amenities which includes the area for the Grounds of Sculpture, comedy shows and other events and after a long day to be able to dine and have a drink is perfect way to finish your day. \"All in one place\"","1128":"My husband and I came here for brunch on a Sunday, the restaurant was moderately full but service was still great. My husband had the Parish Burger and I had the \"Braised\" Bacon and Eggs. The bacon is basically crispy pork belly, served with cheddar grits, a mustard caviar a poached egg and hollandaise. It was divine! We will definitely be back to eat our weight in grits and try some more of their tempting menu!","1129":"Top notch food and service.  Beautiful restaurant with awesome outdoor seating.  Went in May and everything was in bloom.  Keep up the good work!","1130":"Went for the brunch and food just Ok not worth the 44 dollars. I also expected more I guess. I hear it was better when you got to select your main course and the salads and sides were the buffet part. Oh well.","1131":"The food was off the hook ., never had frog legs before and omg. They great !!  Clean .., fresh ..., highly recommend and drink infusions !!  To die 4. White Long Island ice tea 'nn.","1132":"Rats exceeded the hype. Service was excellent without being annoying. But the food was really outstanding including some \"best Evers\": the truffled cheese in the artisanal cheese appetizer and the scallops. Ramp tartlet and filet mignon also delicious. The stroll thru the Grounds for Sculpture capped a perfect evening. Can't wait to go back.","1133":"I would have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The service was amazing and the food talks for itself. For appetizers I got hush puppies and they were really great paired with the sauce which I didn't expect. Really course I got the pasta dish it's fallen angel I believe and it wasn't too spicy or anything had fresh seafood and it had a long breadstick for you to dunk the extra sauce in. It was very enjoyable to eat this food for dessert I got the bread pudding and let me say I love the caramel drizzle on top. For drinks they have a wide variety and you can find anything and everything you want. The dishes are around $15-$28 depending on what you order. They have oysters market price of course. This is perfect for a date night or a perfect get together with friends and family.","1134":"Great service. Great food. Found this little hidden treasure and Im so happy we did. Still not really sure why the place is named Rat's, but happy I didn't let that deter me. I would have loved outdoor seating but it was just too humid, so opted for indoor near the window. Definitely will be returning here if Im in the area.","1135":"Neat place, very good food, I got the Parish Burger and the bread pudding, both incredible! So much on the menu I want to try but sadly I don't live here and my belly couldn't handle more than one entree and dessert. Service was top notch, Kelsey was amazing, very sweet. Would definitely come back here and recommend to friends!","1136":"Back at rats.  Burger was great.   John  was working. Yea. He always has a smile.","1137":"We love Baby Kay's in Mesa, AZ but it is quite far from us now.\nThat is why whenever we travel I am happy to try Cajun places, still looking for a favorite other than Baby Kay's. Well, this was not it.\nThe place is a little too 'trendy' for my taste, if you know what I mean. We ended up getting a high table, which is not my favorite, and the salt shaker was very dirty and I had to ask server to clean it for us.\nHubby had fish and chips, and I had the gumbo. It comes with rice and it was good, but for the prices the portion was very small. It comes with Hush Puppies.\nThey had 2 types of sugar and only the pink artificial sweetener.","1138":"The food was amazing!!! We did the tasting menu which was a great value... 5 courses including wine for $100 each... Well worth it... The wait staff was so attentive and knowledgable... The grounds were breathtaking... We will be back !","1139":"Cocktails were amazing and the place has a good vibe. I guess I was let down when the gumbo came out and it was luke warm instead of being hot. The rice with it was hot, and the hush puppies were okay, but it just seemed liked they microwaved the leftovers and threw in the crawfish tails directly from the fridge. Flavor wise it was just okay. I'll give the place another shot, but the recommended gumbo didn't represent it well.","1140":"Start out promising with the hush puppies but fizzled out with the meal and drinks.  In my early 40's, my group of 4 was the youngest on a Saturday night at 8pm other than staff.  Maybe they had an off night because the reviews made this out to be WAY better than it was.","1141":"The Parish restaurant had awesome food!  The Bloody Mary was the best Ive ever had.  It had so much in it and things I've never seen or had in a Bloody Mary before.  The people were friendly and service was good.   I will definitely go back!!","1142":"The food was really good, I do want to get that out there first.  Today I called for a 16 person reservation on the day of, which I know is a big ask, but after an hour or two, they were able to work it out. It was my girlfriends birthday and she wanted to go there with her friends, so even if we had to sit apart she would have been happy. But they said they were able to have us seated next to each other. Well we had a few cancellations and turns out 6 of them couldn't make it so I called to revise the reservation. I work in center city and my train was delayed. I arrived about 45 minutes into the reservation and they lead me upstairs to an 8 person table that was already seated with 9. We were crammed in there but I'm not going to cause a scene on my girl's birthday. Well eventually had 2 cancels show up and my girlfriend said \"they said they would try and get another table so we can all eat together\". Turns out that's not the case. When we asked if we could join with another table, they said no. Which was a bit weird when I saw 4 other tables open. Again, not going to cause a scene. So they get seated at another table. As we roll through the night I see a few couples come in and a few go, but they never filled out the last 3 tables and by the end of the night when we left, over 6 tables empty. That was not nice of them. \n\nThen it came time for the check and he plops it down and I see the check was never split up. I know chain restaurants that do this automatically for a $60 bill. This was over $600 and the waiter was like \"I can only split it up evenly\". I asked if he was serious and he looked me dead in the eye and said yes. We would have told him what we had to make it easier but he wasn't looking to be very helpful here. So we all do our own math and turns out a few people over paid which he probably made out on, but at this point I'm done and just want my elbow room back.","1143":"Our party of 4 got plenty of appetizers(I think we got all on the menu) to share amongst us and a round of drinks. The plate of cheese and the escargot stood out. Everything else didn't disappoint either. 5\/5 for the service and food. Plan on re-visiting for dinner.","1144":"What a beautiful place for lunch! We walked in during the lunch hour rush without a reservation. The hostess took our names down and told us that it would be a 45 minute wait and they would text us when our table was ready. We were okay with the wait time as it gave us a chance to explore the Grounds for Sculpture which has an entrance through the gardens of the restaurant for an additional fee. The wait time ended up being more like 25 minutes which was good. We were seated out on the patio overlooking the bridge which had a beautiful view. There are little ducks that gather around in this area and circle their way around the table but that did not bother us. We started off with a peach Bellini and a mango spritzer - both refreshing after a walk on a hot day. We then ordered the French onion soup to share. It was a classic tasting French onion soup with lots of cheese on top of the bread. For entrees, we got the chicken Milanese and a Moroccan lamb stew. The portion size for both was very small. Additionally, the chicken Milanese did not have any flavor from the breading and because it was breast meat after a while it got tiring to eat. There was no sauce or gravy served with it, just a lightly dressed slaw. For dessert, we got the lemon and thyme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was topped with a blackberry pur\u00e9e. Not much notes of the lemon or thyme came through from the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but it was satisfying nonetheless. This place is an awesome date spot with magnificent views of the outdoors if you get a seat by the patio. We would return more for the ambience than the cuisine!","1145":"Louisiana flavor located in north Tucson! I saw Abita rootbeer on the menu and had to have it to satisfy my sweet tooth, and it's one of the best rootbeers (yum!). My friend and I ordered the pretzels to start (amazing!) and the Pimpinadas. Those were good but the flavors were interesting. It's jerk chicken wrapped in an empanada topped with peach marmalade. I didn't think the peach went with the jerk chicken, maybe a spicier topping would compliment the chicken better.\n\nFor the main dish, we split the Smokin' Angel. The dish comes with burgundy angel hair pasta, which I had never seen before, and a mesquite smoked tomato sauce, giving the pasta a really rich and salty flavor. I've never had something like this before, and I'm sad to report that it wasn't my favorite. I'm not much of a seafood lover, so I can't speak about the majority of their menu, but everyone around me looked very happy with their mussels and oysters.\n\nI'd be happy to come back, get another rootbeer, try the gumbo and get those pretzels again!","1146":"There is no way to top the food, the decor, combined with the adjacent sculpture museum. Most amazing dining experience of my life.","1147":"I finally made a weekday visit to the Grounds for Sculpture park and am now thinking about my next visit.  It was an Indian summer type day (Oct), with temps in the mid 80's and the park was beautiful.\n\nMy friends have raved about Rat's Restaurant to me for some time now.  Although I see some reviewer complaints about the service, I did not have that experience.  I did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated and this was a late lunch, 2:30PM.  Ideally, I would've preferred to have been seated outside, with the weather being so perfect, however, a reservation was needed for that.  I did get to sit by the window, so my view was just fine.\n\nI had the Burger Fromage served on a plump brioche bun. It was not bad, but it could've been better if the bun was grilled\/toasted.  I want to mention that my entree arrived before the bread & herbed butter and unsweetened iced tea.  That was kind of odd.  Well, after my burger, I had the bread and herbed butter.....SO GOOD! \n\nI will return.","1148":"FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC!!  Food was brilliant, service was superb and a cute cute spot.\n\nHighly recommend!  We drove from Phoenix to try I should add.","1149":"Dyn-o-mite!  \nThis was a great find.  Thank you Yelpers.  The pork belly , egg app was awesome and the Haitian pulled pork sandwich was great with good heat,\n\nGreat service, welcoming and attentive!\n\nGood beer list also.  Next time I am in town, I will be back.","1150":"Expectations for our first visit here ran high based on all the rave Yelper reviews but alas we had a decidedly underwhelming meal @ Rat's. The ambiance of the place is rather nice, in a Disney themed sort of way, and I assume meant to imitate a European villa - lots of heavy wood, very ornate, the sort of place you may expect a fairy princess to stroll through rather than the resturant floor manager. We were seated upstairs in what is essentially a very large hallway but comfortable enough to house several tables for 2-3 people each. Our waiter was personable and eager to hear any questions or make suggestions but basically everything we ordered was 'his favorite'. OK\n\nWe ordered a couple of coctails to start and a glass of wine each to enjoy with our mains. The pear martini was perfect: not too sweet and very refreshing. For our starters we enjoyed a salad of greens and the Leek Tartlet with poached egg. Both were very nice and combined would make for a perfect lunch dish\n\nFor our mains we ordered the Caramelized Scallops with petite vegetables and the Braised Short Rib Bourguignon with gorgonzola polenta and Tuscan kale pancetta. Our food arrived but the wines did not. Hungry from an afternoon of exploring the Grounds for Sculpture we dove into our food. Everything was OK but nothing outstanding - the scallops were slightly overcooked and the short ribs lacked the tenderness one expects from this dish. Our wines finally arrived as we were nearing the end of our mains with apologies from our waiter. My friend turned her glass away. I did not but wish I had - the wine itself was fine but I barely got through half the glass because was nearly done with my food. A panna cotta was a lovely way to end the meal ... but not lovely enough to make us forget that our water glasses had not been refilled once during the entire meal. Not once. \n\nOverall a disapponting experience because we expected a fabulous meal and service (and based on the prices should have had one) but instead it was just OK. Will not be keen to return as the area is full of great restaurants\n\nAlso, do yourself a favor and skip the 'Toad Hall Shop' located next door. It was surely named after the facial expressions worn by both of the ladies working there. Miserable, the pair of them - could not even be bothered to return our greetings","1151":"The Drunken Angel and burger were fabulous (I have had many Alfredo pastas in my life, this was probably the best). My only issue was that my 12 oz bottle of beer ended up being $7 (I can get a six pack for that) and the additions to the Backyard Burger did not have a listed price. We assumed they were included so got them all, then found out when the bill came that they were all $1-2 each! The $9 burger ended up being $20.","1152":"we arrived at this interesting place....  very pretty and great decor... the gardens were a nice relaxing walk. although it was cut short by the rain... :0(\nonto the food.  the appetizers were small portioned but tasty.   the main course , has a lot of faults...  the chicken was poorly cooked and a small portion.  our table came to an agreement that none of the main dishes had flavor.  low on salt and any other spices.  \nfor the prices, i would expect a french dish that actually tastes like french food...  \ni have had better food and service. any time you have to ask three different people for a place setting,it is not a good sign... i give this place two stars for the dessert and environment....","1153":"I brought my husband here for his birthday.  The have a pretty good menu option.  Also, they have various infusions which is really impressive and creative. They're behind the bar on display (I took pictures!).  My husband had the shrimp and grits and I had the drunken angel. Both were very good!  I'll be back for happy (liquid courage) and noshes.","1154":"The perfect compliment to the Sculpture Gardens in Hamilton. A rustic, classic French country restaurant. Inside and outside dining areas, the outside area is alongside a small lake. The whole setting is straight out of an Impressionist painting. The menu is fairly simple fare, the food is very good, the service friendly and efficient. Not terribly expensive. Reservations recommended. If you eat outside, watch out for the ducks running around. Surprisingly, there is no 'Canard' on the menu.","1155":"My favorite place in Tucson. We go like twice a month. Shrimp and grits is my absolute fave, the greens are seasoned so well; I thought my grandma was in the kitchen! We've gotten in good with one of the bartenders so we always get outstanding service. I've been here for their special events, late nights, busy fridays and even brunch and I've never been disappointed. \n\n\nFaves are shrimp and grits (I know I said that already, that's how good it is), frog legs, mussels (OMG THE MUSSELS AND BREAD), crawfish hushpuppies, NOLA BULLDOG! (Seasonal drink) and the goat cheese relleno. Seriously you won't be disappointed. Can't forget the gumbo! Five stars.","1156":"a perfect compliment to a day at the sculpture garden it is adjacent to, or just a very good meal out. Beautiful and unique surroindings and ambiance matched by the food. Excellent wine list and cocktail choices, this is excellent fine dinning so do not expect burger and fries after a sweaty day in the park in shorts and a t shirt.","1157":"I visited Rats on a weekday for lunch, and had a great experience.  Fresh homemade blueberry lemonade and bread with herb butter were delicious.  My wife and I both got the mussels with frites and were very happy.  The coffee and cappuccino were both stellar as well, and obviously the surroundings are second to none at Grounds for Sculpture.","1158":"A great set of new flavors in Tucson. I enjoy the gumbo, hush puppies, and drunken angel dish they are all fantastic and will surely improve your day. Prices are reasonable. The bar and cocktails are top notch they have a wide variety of house infused alcohols that are delicious. Clearly a lot of though was put into the layout and building of this establishment. The atmosphere is fantastic and it's a great place for casual dining or dates.","1159":"This was our first trip to Rat's, but it won't be our last.  The restaurant and the attached Grounds for Sculpture is in an industrial area, and the road for the restaurant isn't well marked (aside from a large sculpture of a rat).  However, the restaurant really feels like it's in the French countryside.  The building looks huge from the outside, but the interior is broken up into little dining rooms.  There was a private party going on downstairs and in the garden, so we were seated in an upstairs dining room (the room with the mural).  Since I like to know these things - the upstairs ladies room was lovely, very clean and spacious.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see the grounds, but it's certainly an excuse to come back.\n\nThe dinner was great - we started with the cheese plate and lots of bread (roasted garlic bread and cheese popovers).  We were also treated to a small tuna tartare (compliments of the chef - everyone in our dining room got one).  For dinner, my husband had the steak au poivre (the fries alone were worth it) and I had the short rib bourguignon.  Both were delicious.  For dessert my husband had the \"Brown Cow\" (a root beer float with homemade root beer and chocolate ice cream) and I had the coconut mojito sorbet.  When I made the reservations I told them it was for our anniversary, and both desserts arrived on decorated plates that read \"Happy Anniversary.\"\n\nWe didn't have any problems with our service.  The waiters were all great - kept their distance but were on hand when we needed them.  One critique - two tables away from us was a station with the plates, glasses, etc.  It seemed extremely close to the tables and it was noisy when the waiters went to get stuff from it.  In such a huge restaurant, why not have those stations hidden or at least in a less conspicuous spot?\n\nEven with a $50 Groupon, we spent over $100 (two glasses of wine, one appetizer, two entrees and two desserts).  We won't come back soon, simply because of the expense, but we will definitely be back!","1160":"All-around great deep south fare! The drunken sailor is an awesome Cajun shrimp pasta dish. One of my favorite restaurants in Tucson.","1161":"Wow!! My husband and I recently had dinner at The Parish!!! Best creole dinner outside of Louisiana!! And as always, they have some of the best cocktails with their infused spirits we've had in Tucson! The fish and chips is consistently tremendous! All topped off with excellent service. Our new fave!!!","1162":"The Parish continues to serve excellent cocktails; creative, bright, and beautiful. The food consistently impresses me and my family. Great customer service. It is obvious that the staff enjoy their jobs, and that comes across with servers, bartenders, and busers. \n\nThe fish and chips manages to deliver a perfectly crispy outside and a juicy flakey inside. The batter is thin and perfectly spiced. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits with a side of greens. Big tender shrimp sit on top of a crunch cake of grits with a tasty gravy over the top that seep into the grits without rendering them soggy. If you are thinking to yourself, \"hmm, that would pair perfectly with buttery slow cooked greens,\" you are correct. I would order the greens alone if it were possible.\n\nMy favorite appetizers are the fresh oysters, bacon popcorn, pork rinds, and the smoked trout plate.  I'm less enthusiastic about the hushpuppies and the frog legs. Finally, you should order the dessert of the day, if it still available. The bread pudding is meh, but the specials always deliver.","1163":"The service here was great. Our server was super friendly and a man who I believe was the manager greeted us at least twice to make sure everything was ok. The restaurant is definitely small with probably about 10 small tables and a bar. My husband and I got the crawfish hushpuppies as an appetizer, they could have been a little more moist but were spicy and good. I got the pulled pork sandwich, which was great and had the right amount of cilantro and condiments. My husband got the fish and chips and enjoyed it as well. The beer was called Akira Amber and was amazing! With that and my soda, the meal came to about $38 total. We will be back for sure.","1164":"We ate there last night and had one of the best meals we've had in Tucson.  My daughter had the fish and chips and they are the best in town or any I've ever tried.  I had the shrimp and grits and must say that was one of my all time favorite meals in Tucson.  Very memorable comfort-style food.","1165":"One of our favorite Cajun style dining experiences!  Wonderful service, perfect menu selections, resulting in flavorful, perfectly prepared cuisine!!","1166":"I came here after driving by for two years..... I was pleasantly surprised. It was was great service by the bartender Nathan. Great drinks and our food was really good. It came out quick and was delish. I will definitely come back!","1167":"I've visited The Parish twice and really have enjoyed both meals here. I confess, I've ordered the same thing both times, but some times you stick with what's good, and Johnny steak and fries are absolutely delicious. The sauce that smothers the steak has the right punch of flavor to it and is so good when mixed in with the fries. My girlfriend liked the flavor of the sauce as well but said it was a bit salty for her taste.  I was able to share small tastes of other dishes from those sitting at my table and everything I tried was really good. This place packs flavor in everything they cook. Nice. Some of the plates can get a little pricey but they do give big portions that you get your money's worth and won't leave hungry. The second trip there, they had a talented young girl giving an acoustic performance and they book different small acts (magic, music, etc) to perform. Solid 4.5 stars, push it to 5 star for atmosphere.","1168":"I love the parish all 3 times we have there the service has been amazing. There's nothing to hate here. The place itself is so cool and gothic and dark. Just walking in you are taken in by the art on the walls and the voodoo theme bar. The food has been great everytime as well , specially the fries, order anything and get fries. The service is so good and everyone is on their game and treats you good. We have been there on a jampacked Saturday night and on a early Sunday and still get the same great service. Now as for the main reason I go there...the drinks. The drinks are top notch. Their menu is like no other because they use so many of their infusions. The drinks are really good and I like that they will make you anything you can imagine using one of their crazy infusions.  It's always a good time here and I highly recommend this place for brunch,lunch ,dinner or just drinks.","1169":"We have gone to The Parish many times and love the food and atmosphere.  Any time a friend is in town, this is our go-to place.  We've always had phenomenal food and equally amazing service.  The Parish knows how to take care of its customers without being intrusive or overbearing.  Wonderful place and HIGHLY recommended!","1170":"Went here for brunch and was slightly disappointed with my experience. The setup for the brunch buffet is a little awkward, we had to go upstairs to get our food and our seating was downstairs but in a main area so people were walking through as we were having our meal. The food itself was good but I was slightly disappointed in the selection since it is so expensive. They did have two carving stations and an omelette\/pancake build your own station but other than that I was not highly impressed with what they were offering. The view is beautiful and you can walk  around the gardens after which was nice. Overall I was not impressed based off the amount of money you are spending on the brunch buffet. Though I would probably not revisit this place for brunch I have heard good things about their dinner menu.","1171":"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant. First at all, we were late due to traffic by 15 minutes and the manager didn't want to seat us (we were coming from New York City and spent 1h 15 mins to get there). Eventually, they seated us at a table. We ordered 3 appetizers which were impossible to eat. Very poor quality of olives, cheese, meats, bread and etc.. On top of that our waiter didn't want to clean the table before serving hot dishes,  and gave us a very dirty look while wiping the table. Finally, after 50 mins after ordering the main course, they put cold steaks and french fries on the table with inedible seafood salad. All the main courses went back to the kitchen because it had a terrible taste. \nOnly the park by the restaurant was beautiful, the rest from food to service was horrible. Eat home and go straight to the park to take beautiful pictures.","1172":"5 stars for service, ambiance and food! All around a wonderful experience. We were seated inside but saw how gorgeous the outside seating was and that a table just left. I'm very happy I asked to be seated outside. We ate with a water streams, greens and peacocks. It felt like a beautiful dream on the set of a beautiful movie.\n\nThe bread was delicious, we had a salmon appetizer that was just perfect. We were continuously served different breads, and the entrees were extremely balanced. Simple and elegant- but the optimal word is balanced. Not too heavy and food flavor. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was great, and while we ordered a dessert, when she asked how it was and we said it wasn't great, she promptly asked if she could bring something else whereby we got a chance to get the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Glad we did! The Cappuccino and espresso was a nice ending to the evening too. I think 6:30 PM is a good time to get dinner in and then some time to walk around the gardens on the Grounds for Sculptures.\n\nI plan on coming back very often and will bring my friends and family here. It was such a perfect evening!","1173":"Really excellent Croque Madame and rabbit Ragu! Couldn't get a reservation until 215 for lack of servers but was able to jump in and eat at the bar the place is just plain impressive, food was awesome, so was service, the grounds are amazing","1174":"Here in Tuscon on a business engagement & were searching for cuisines that are from our home state. Yelp'd the parish and decided to give it a try. Had the BBQ Pigtails as an appetizer and the Drunken Angel and Johnny Steak & Fries as entr\u00e9es. Let me tell ya, they were all AWESOME. We mentioned to our waiter that we were from Louisiana & were looking for some good home cooked food! He actually told the owner we were there & he came out to personally meet us, being that he was also from the Baton Rouge area. That made our visit a much more enjoyable one & we're looking foward to dining again before our stay is over. Good food & staff with the Louisiana hospitality in Arizona!","1175":"Why has it taken me so long to go to this restaurant?  Oh my. Enjoyment from every direction. Beautiful decor that is full of personality but not overdone. Witty staff with great timing and all around good service. And, the food.... !!!!\n\nI tired the pimpanadas to start (empanadas with jerk chicken, a bit of orange marmalade, over a slaw of jicama and chayote) - with one bit I knew this was going to be a great meal.  I had the smoked salmon salad as an entree, and a bite (that's all he'd let me have) of my husband's gumbo - deeeeelish!  \n\nI want one in midtown!","1176":"I can't even explain how excited I was to finally give this place a taste. I heard the reviews, I've seen the menu.  Bacon wrapped frogs legs? Bacon popcorn? drunken pasta? I was certain that this southern bistro would look my palate straight in the eyes, say \"you got a perdy mouf\" and then make my taste buds squeal like a piggy... SQUEAL, PIGGY!   ....Sadly this was not quite the case.\n When walking in I felt the vibe of a locals' only pub, crazy signs on the wall, jackolopes hanging over the bar, but the first thing I noticed was the size.  Small spaces are normally my favorite, but because of the layout you feel exposed instead of cozy, a weird feeling for such a small space.  But no big deal, you can't taste atmosphere, the food is what is important and I was ready for a feast.\nMy friend and I each got an appetizer, For myself, the frogs legs, which I have never had before and was excited to give a try.  For my friend the bacon popcorn.  Both have received high praise.  The popcorn came first, still popping and sizzling, my taste buds fantasized the taste of bacon, popped corn, spices and seasons that would show an intriguing twist on a southern bistros vision of popcorn.  I put the popcorn in my mouth and it tasted.... well.. just like popcorn.  No Bacon flavor, no real spices or glazes.  Now don't get me wrong, it was good popcorn, cooked in half bacon fat, half oil, it would definitely be a prime pick over movie popcorn if i was going to the cinema. but besides that there was nothing I could see that made this outstanding, I shrugged it off and just accepted it as good bar food (the popcorn would be AMAZING if you were drunk and wanting a snack).  Next was the frog legs, and I must say, this did catch me by surprise.  The frog legs were perfectly seasoned, bacon delicious, however the amphibious creature who's limbs I was eating started to taste too fishy for me and eventually lost my appetite for them, Just not for me personally I guess, but nevertheless I simply wasn't anything that popped for me.\nNow was time for the entree's.  The Gumbo and side of hush-puppies for myself and the Drunken pasta for the lady.  I tried the crawfish hushpuppies... FINALLY, just delicious, fried balls of goodness, perfectly flavored. However the Gumbo was not as outstanding. Once again it was good, but it wasn't fantastic.  \nall in all the only thing that really told my taste buds to squeal was my friends dish, the drunken pasta, a Bouillabaisse style dish of freakin deliciousness.  \n\nOverall:  \"The Parish\" Is a place with unlimited potential. A southern bistro willing to take risks with frog legs, bacon grease, and even a yellow pepper vodka cocktail. These are things you would hope to see from hybrid food, and lets face it, risky food is half the fun.  However none of these risks seemed to impress, nor was it anything special enough for me to go back for. However I feel like i need to give this place a second try just to be sure, so....... to be continued... ladies and gentlemen...","1177":"We had our wedding reception at Rats this April and it was absolutely wonderful!  The venue is gorgeous and the staff is very easy to work with.  Christopher and the chef were able to create a delicious gluten free menu for the event.  We were extremely pleased with the food and the service.  We highly recommend Rats!","1178":"Just awesome food all around. I Had to try the bacon popcorn and had no regrets! we'll definitely be back soon!","1179":"We were at Grounds for Sculpture. We called Rat's to ask about their gluten-free options, due to one person in our family having Celiac's. They say they would get back to us in a few minutes. It took them 3 days and 4 hours to get back to us. The 7 of us ate in Bordentown, instead. So we have no idea how good the food is, and we are not likely to be there again any time soon.","1180":"Great food, friendly and attentive service, and nice atmosphere. \n\nThis is not a sports bar, as some have eluded to in t heir reviews, but a southern influenced gastropub.  \n\nIt can be loud, as this is not a large establishment, but its not what I would call overwhelming.   \n\nI would absolutely return the next time I'm in Tucson.  I might even try one of their specialty cocktails constructed with house made infused vodka, gin or bourbon.","1181":"Great service and good food. I feel duped after calling to ask for happy hour specials and discovering ion arrival that their $5 appetizers are just the normal everyday price.  Pretty cheap. Food was good, but didn't blow me away. Not bad but there are so many GREAT places I probably won't be back.","1182":"Scenery and decor were gorgeous, staff was courteous and professional (hiya, Peter!) and the food was very good.  Portions were a little small and prices a little high, but overall a lovely experience.  Probably wouldn't go back (due to the price, more than anything else) but I am glad that I came.  Like the Grounds for Sculpture itself, it's a one or at most two times kind of place.","1183":"They have an array of infused liquors. Both bartenders were spot on on their recommendations. Appetizers were very good too. Can't wait to come back for an actual\nMeal.","1184":"This place is amazing. We went for our first time and will be back. The cornbread is amazing, we ended up ordering two. Every entree was amazing. I ended up getting the mussels appetizer as a meal and it was perfect. The sauce and bread paired perfectly. The steak was full of flavor and perfectly cooked. The angel hair pasta my husband described as the best pasta he's ever had. To top it off we had the peach cobbler for dessert. It was made to perfection and delicious. The homemade whipped cream really topped it off. Their infused liquors are great. Each drink was delicious. Our server (Jessie) was helpful, friendly and fun. She perfectly helped us navigate the menu and was a great time! We will 100% be back","1185":"I'm in love with the bacon popcorn because of the quality crispy bacon, pepper spice and delicate oil in every bite.","1186":"Our first of many visits I am sure... what a great vibe and wonderful service.. ok now for the food.. we had to try the bacon popcorn and cornbread and ended up taking them to go when our meals arrived.. the special tonight was a smoked \"brontasarus\" beef rib.. braised in a Dr. Pepper sauce, so tender and a wonderful smokey mesquite flavor that melted in our mouths and then we had to try the Drunken Angel.. wonderful compliment with shrimp and crayfish in a rich sauce and Angel hair burgundy pasta..had a nice kick to it! Couldn't leave without trying the homemade bread pudding... highly recommend you save room or you take it to go for later when you finally surface out of your food induced coma!  Thank you for an excellent experience.. we will be back.. soon!!","1187":"The atmosphere is beautiful! The walk through the gardens was very pleasant.  The food however was not so pleasant.  We went to celebrate my fathers ( retired chef) birthday, there was seven of us in the party.  Our total bill was $374.33.  This is what we ordered,\nApps: smoked salmon $8 \/ 2orders of poutines ( french fries w\/ cheese and gravy) $8 each\/ Tapas plate $15 included roasted red peppers, mushrooms, almonds, anchovies, hummus, mixed olives\/ cheese plate $9\/ mussels (usually a  main course) $16\/\nMain Course: 3orders Basaquaise (chicken dish w\/ rice) $18each\/ 2orders of steak freites $26 each\/ 1 Cuban sandwich $13\/ 1 salmon $18\nDesserts: 1 mousse cup , 1 cherry bomb, 1 choc decadence $ 8 each \nWhere do I start... After ordering all those apps I thought our hungry bunch would be satisfied, but no such luck.  The portions were small and not very tasty at all.  The hummus lacked flavor, the rest of the Tapas plate was not memorable. The cheese plate was so small by the time it reached me there was nothing left! The poutines were my favorite app! They were very well seasoned and was the only app that was portioned well for the price.  The mussels were flavorful but glad I ordered it as an app because no way would it have filled up my 5 year old as a dinner portion!   On to the main course, I was very disappointed when we received our dishes. My dad's salmon was so puny with 1 red potato cut into 3 pieces and a few asparagus. My daughters both ordered the steak and said it was good.  Good size portion and they were happy.  ( not a kids meal, full size portions but they were $26 - my 6 year old ate the whole thing!) The steaks were the biggest portions on the table! On to the chicken, do not order this dish as it lacks flavor, originality, and did I say flavor?  Three small pieces of bone in chicken with a bit of bland rice in a bowl with way to much sauce the rice was swimming! This dish was worse than bad dinner food! The Cuban sandwich looked good, but when my sister bit into it the mustard grains (whole) shocked her! I guess they charge extra to grind the mustard seeds! The desserts took a while to arrive but they were well worth the wait! Yum! You may want to go just for the desserts! We did see the waiter walk by with a tray of burgers for another table and they did look good and nicely portioned! We spoke with other customers who had had brunch there and they said they enjoyed it and was more than plentiful. We probably should have had brunch instead! I would not eat there again, to much money to leave hungry! My husband heated up last nights left overs when we got home! \nFinal Thoughts: pretty grounds to walk around, food-not so good, desserts- YUM!   *********PRICEY for the Portions! Total Bill $374!","1188":"Very interesting and unique experience. The restaurant has a fairy tale theme going on and I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. The food was mediocre at best.","1189":"The food was very good, and I've only seen bacon popped popcorn at one other restaurant. Great service!","1190":"Some of the best Southern food I have had outside of the South! The BBQ pigs tail is a must nosh. I have tried multiple entrees and have loved them all! The atmosphere is lively (some nights have live music) and casual with creative plates to match. We love to keep coming back when we are in town.","1191":"This place rocks!  Stopped in for lunch. Had a burger and coleslaw. Best coleslaw I'd ever had at a restaurant!  Red cabbage based with some interesting spicing. Burger is first rate!  Topping off the fun is a very nice waitress.","1192":"Sorry ...was very disappointed!  Today ate in Rat's for the first time,\nglowing reviews etc from friends, but it's very overpriced average food.\n\nIt was lunch, so I had the French onion soup ($11) was ok, hint of tomato in it which was weird, like greasy red oil.    Then had the French Dip ($19) which was served with horseradish cream sauce...(no, not horseradish sauce more like average mayo.   The sandwich was served barely warm with shoe string fries also luke warm.   I sent back and received it back warmer.   The roast beef was leathery in spots and shop-rite appy roast beef would be better.    \nVery much overpriced for the average (less than even) food you were served.    We talked about going and was really looking forward to, won't go again.","1193":"Disappointing. We liked the drinks tho, and there is the statue park behind, with a nice views of the water, koi fish and such. \n\nThe menu sounds interesting, but the results were uninspired and not very French. The \"onion soup\" was more a cheese dip than anything, but without the chips. Some of the other food was ok, but nothing stood out. We tried each others dishes, but there were no favorites. \n\nGo here for the drinks and location, not for the dining. Might be a nice place for outdoor drinks on a summer evening.","1194":"The food here is excellent, have never had a bad meal.  The decor is whimsey, rustic and artistic.  This environment adds to a unique experience that very inviting and cozy.  I love the outside terrace.  I think overall the place is clean though I've on occasion felt it could be cleaner (musty smell, dust, etc.).  I may just be a little too aware but I feel I expect perfection in all areas from an upscale, expensive restaurant.\n\nMy wedding reception was held here several years ago and I do not have one complaint except to say the price wasn't as fair as I would've liked.  At the time weddings were not package priced, you paid individually for each hor d'oeuvre, each appetizer, meal and drink.  Ouch.  It worked out as we kept it small.  I noticed they have packages now which is great for those looking for a wedding venue.  You will not be disappointed.","1195":"This place is just not good. Food is mediocre as is service. We literally had to remind staff about our orders because they simply 'forgot' or prioritized other tables. We had to ask for a bread basket while every other table was already served one. And to make matters worse, the price point for just one entree is absurd for the quality and quantity. Save your money. \n\nWill not return.","1196":"Cons:\nSmall, crowded, and loud when there's live music. So why 4 stars? Because\nPros:\nIf you're looking for fairly heavy cajun-esque food, it's absolutely delicious. And while I'm not a fan of loud music, it's been quite good when we go. Parking is fairly easy in this strip mall location.","1197":"The atmosphere was very great, for us it was a late night\/date night vibe with some jazz musicians. The liquors were infused and tastier than your average and the plates available at the time were all quite good. The bacon popcorn might have been a little oversold from a friend, so that was a slight let down but that's not the establishment's fault. I was a fan of the jambalaya.","1198":"Afternoon walking through the Grounds for Sculpture capped off by late lunch (we had a 4:00 reservation) at Rat's.  Over the years we've heard very good things about the place.\n\nWith the exception of a few people the wait staff was very rude.  Once seated, we had to request the table be cleaned because half the table was sticky.  We also had to request a clean bread plate because one of ours was dirty.\n\nAfter waiting entirely too long for the appetizers (soup and salad) the waiter came over to ask if the manager had stopped by.  He said he noticed our food was taking too long and asked the manager to stop by and talk to us.  He said he'd be right by.\n\nGood salad,  mediocre & lukewarm vegetable soup - still no manager.\n\nMy wife's Chicken Paillard was very good.  My hanger steak (medium) was very tough and gamey.  The waiter saw there was an issue so he offered to bring it back to the kitchen.  I asked for the burger.  How can you ruin a burger?  Apparently by making it so greasy that the stale bun falls apart and top it with a green tomato.  And calling them Pommes Frites does not make the fries any less soggy.\n\nStill no manager.  We decided to cut our losses and have dessert elsewhere.  $83.00 would have bought a much better meal at Seasons 52 or even the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nAt least the Gardens were enjoyable.","1199":"Service was excellent and so was the food! We ordered gumbo and cornbread as an appetizer. The gumbo was fantastic. Perfect roux and just enough spice. We were practically licking the bowl. The drunken angel pasta was delicious as well! My husband said it was the best pasta dish he's ever had. Our waiter was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. He treated us like we were old friends. Great atmosphere and great food. We will definitely be back!!","1200":"This is by far my favorite place in Tucson. The food is old school Louisiana grub and the atmosphere guys right along with it. Pricey but totally worth it","1201":"The restaurant is super cute and the service was great, but unfortunately the food just isn't up to par. Given the quality and quantity of food offered, the price is not reasonable.","1202":"Another restaurant I can say I am proud to have worked. I work many staffs ago so I cannot speak for the food currently, but the ambiance is amazing! I have always been perplexed as to why people did not frequent the bar for a cocktail and a stroll around. The building itself is a masterpiece with wood beams imported from French farmhouses. You needn't even go onto the 40 acres of sculpture park\/garden to be inspired, just wander the restaurant with a great brew and see what millions of dollars buys you, I'll tell you, you will not be let down!","1203":"LOVE!! Sunday nights here are great with live music and the food and drinks are delicious. The bacon popcorn is a must!","1204":"What a fabulous find! We came directly from the airport and were not disappointed! \nOur waitress, Amber, made the perfect recommendations and their billing as a gastropub is spot on! \nThe Bacon Popcorn has a great pepper kick along with chunks of bacon- how can you miss with this salty\/peppery\/bacon rich starter. \nI had trouble deciding between the Shrimp Po-Boy and The Drunken Angel... the Angel won on Amber's advice and wow, just Wow! So rich and velvety with huge shrimps and seafood. A taste treat not to be missed! \nMy husband had the Haitian Pork Sandwich which was made with habanero oil...! Yes! Awesome! Fries were crispy and homemade slaw. Super fresh and fantastic! \nAnd not to stop there... fresh squeezed lemonade and Bread Pudding... the pudding was like eating a Cinnabon and apple pie in one deliriously delicious concoction!","1205":"What a great surprising find in Tucson !!\nOutstanding Cajun food at reasonable prices!! We always bring out of town guests here and they ask to come back ( no surprise ) in their next visit\nAnd the outstanding diverse beer selection from around the country is an added bonus\nIf you're looking for authentic regional food from Cajun country, the Parrish should be on your list !!\nRick Vogel\nSaddkebrooke","1206":"Ground for Sculpture is a world within a world,  Rats is separate from GFS  and the Cafe is amazing, great happy hour prices with a warm atmosphere.   As for the bartenders well they act like you're bothering them if you ask for drink, so that needs to looked at immediately.   My one complaint about Rat's as a whole would be that when they have private events they need to put proper signage stating that this is a private event.  Several times my husband and friends have walked into the restaurant and sat down at the bar and then only to be told that this is a private event and we need to leave.  Come on people get it together it's not that hard.   Those damn Rats!","1207":"Parish brings classic Cajun cuisine to the desert, and I'm so thankful! The signature drink menu has a little something for everyone. Loved Dutch Well Water with the house infused cucumber gin and lavender water.. it tastes like you're drinking flowers. Don't forget to try Parishioner as well!  We went for an early happy hour and ordered a plethora of appetizers. From the hushpuppies to goat cheese relleno, try them all! We loved the frog legs, Hot Legs Le'Jean and the oysters! As we were heading out there was live music setting up. Try it for yourself, we can't wait to go back for a crawfish boil!","1208":"The place was recommended to us and the menu looked quite interesting.  For many folks the food is probably great but it wasn't our cup of tea.  too heavy and spicy.  Service was excellent tho.","1209":"The Parish Burger and The Wings were to die for. You better believe i'm sending everyone I know in The Parish's direction. Can't wait to try the Bacon Popcorn, i'm going back tonight!","1210":"So I didn't dine at Rat's, however I did enjoy the bar and can say this is a wonderful spot for a romantic date. The atmosphere is perfection!!! And if you live in philly or NJ you can feel like you've taken an exotic vacation with just a quick drive here. The drinks are wonderfully creative, classic and delish. If only I could bring the decor home. I won't reveal everything because some of the best parts of romance are in the surprise, but just bring someone special here and let the magic happen.","1211":"Not sure where all these negative reviews come from. I had a wonderful time here, the food was superb, and the wait staff was courteous and professional. I recommend getting and early reservation to this place as a meal here is a bit long because they want to give you a great time. It is a bit expensive but it didn't feel over priced for what you are getting.","1212":"I've been going to gastropubs a few years on traveling trips. I read the yelp reviews.  This one had some recent service issues that were corrected per my server. Now onto the food. Outstandingly creative and new. Had the BBQ pigtails. Wow! That alone was a treat. Other items and drinks were right on. Don't miss if in Tucson.","1213":"Just left the Parish and had a great meal.  Appetizers were the tasty and an  enough to hold us over until our food arrived.   The main courses were delicious and everyone enjoyed their dish.  Service was excellent,  if you want a quality meal with quality service  visit the Parish for a meal.","1214":"Good to see this place getting such good reviews. Travis Peters used to be the chef @ The Cup, where my wife and I had some of the best entrees available anywhere for any price in Tucson. The boy can really cook and that's why my wife chose The Parish for her birthday dinner. Let me just skip to the food: chile relleno app, Parish burger, gumbo, hushpuppies, & \"The Big Hippie\"....we were not disappointed. Food is 5 stars. That boy can really cook.\n\nOur server was pretty good once she made it to our table (took about 5 minutes). She was the only one on duty. The place is not big but too big for one server. Not her fault, but they were out of 2 things we ordered & one thing I got, I did not order, but it was the gumbo, piping hot & really good. That it was hot was especially nice since the place was absolutely FREEZING. I had to eat w\/my jacket on & I was not happy about that.\n\nNo one has made any negative comments on the ambiance, so maybe people like it. Just want to warn people going to this \"gastropub\" that it ain't no Union Public House.Really to me it had more of the feeling of a dive bar....cold & unwelcoming. My wife actually wanted to leave but I was too hungry to drive around looking for another place. (And besides I REALLY wanted to try the food & I am glad I did). Anyway, I don't really like overly fancy places...in fact I'm a repeat customer at places like Frank's, Bobo's, 1702, Barrio Brewery, & even Boondocks for the $6.50 steak, but for the most part I'd be embarrassed to take a guest to this place. The ambiance was that bad.\n\nI think in this case that gastropub is a misnomer. That name suggests a certain amount of style to me, but when you walk in, the 1st thing you see is just the bar. There is no one to greet you. And the beer selection is way, way too weak. It's mostly just a bar, but with REALLY GOOD food & not much else to recommend it. But I say try it for the food and if you think I'm way off base about the ambiance, let me know about it. I actually hope I was just having a bad dream & am wrong.","1215":"Absolutely loved this place. I've been to Grounds for Sculpture before, but my first time at Rat's, which was recently, was amazing. Our waitress was very kind and took into consideration my boyfriend's allergies. We had outside seating and the view is just so relaxing. In regards to the food, I had the chopped salad which was delicious and my boyfriend had the hummus\/eggplant appetizer which he really enjoyed. We finished off our dinner with the vegan chocolate cake, and it was to die for. My only constructive criticism is that you should offer more vegan friendly dinner options- otherwise, this place will only be a \"special occasion\" type of restaurant we'd visit.","1216":"Food is delicious!!\n\nI tasted the \ncrawfish hushpuppies- so crisp and flavorful\nGoat cheese relleno - i should have ordered two plates\nfish and chips - crispy fresh fish!\nthe parish burger - perfectly cooked\n\njust as a warning .. waitress was pretentiously snobby.\n\nfood made up for it at least","1217":"So glad we found this place driving though Tucson. Should have known it would be good from the full parking lot ! Staff were very friendly  and restaurant had  a nice vibe . Food selections were unique and authentic . We had the gumbo and double thick pork chop  which were both delicious . Only sad note , by the time we were ready for desert, beignets were sold out . Otherwise , had a great dining experience  here.","1218":"The happy hour here is fantastic.  \n\nThe food highlights:\n1.  Short rib sliders are served with a great onion jam on a buttery, lightly toasted roll.  The meat is flavorful but can be a little on the dry side.  Solid 3 stars. $3\n2.  Raisin pecan bread with gorgonzola fondue is simply delicious.  It's a great combination of sweet, savory, and creamy flavors with a nutty crunch.  4 stars.  $3\n3.  Poutine fries were delicious.  They come with a savory, rich gravy and fresh cheese curds.  While they are not as great as the ones found in say, Montreal, they are flavorful, crispy, and very very good for the area.  I have yet to find another restaurant in the vicinity with these fries.  4 stars.  $4\n\nAs you can see, the prices are almost unheard of so you can literally get everything on the happy hour menu and still have change left to spare for a nice glass of wine (recommend the sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, both of which are also half price).\n\nPlus, you CANNOT beat the ambiance.  Who doesn't love a stroll through Renoir's Boaring Party masterpiece followed by a fantastic meal comprised of French cuisine-inspired small plates and French wine?","1219":"I was repeatedly hit by the waiters as they passed behind me.  Made me feel fat or something, whatever, it was my fault for being in the way.  The coup de grace was a dribble of water being poured down my back as somone was served behind me.  Yeah the grounds nice,blah blah blah popovers great, blah blah blah,  food too expensive, blah blah, 50\/50 on those served at the table whether they actually liked their food, blah blah, but what will I remember? BUMP.","1220":"Very disappointed coming here for my birthday to find out that the menu they have online is not the menu at the restaurant it's called bait and switch \nFor the prices they should accommodate the customer they lost a few hundred dollars on two people who were there to celebrate my birthday we would've ordered four entr\u00e9es alone and not one of them was being offered on their new menu.  \nThey are a bunch of dirty rats no pun intended\nKc Prime here we come","1221":"Went for dinner on a Sunday night and it was pretty much empty. Had a great waiter greet us. They have a lot of beer choices but mostly bottles. They advertised live music but they were packing up and leaving by the time we got there. We ate cornbread as an appetizer which was well liked. We ordered the eggplant veggie burger, the house burger, and a steak salad. Everything was cooked amazingly and the fries were to die for! I wouldn't necessarily drive access town but if your this way and looking for somewhere to go I recommend it.","1222":"I dined at Rats for the first time on Saturday after an all day excision around the Grounds for Sculpture. It was a wonderful experience. \n\nFirst the food was great. We choose the cheese plate trying all 5 times. The accompaniments to the cheeses were great and paired so well - honey, raspberry jam, apples, almonds, and think toasted bread. Also, Rats does not skimp on the bread for the table, thick slices of Doreen's fresh baked bread is served by the waiter. Wonderful! We had Rosemary, raisin, and French baguette slices. \n\nThe main course was grand as well. I had the trout, which I found a bone, but was manageable. There was a great tasting sauce and perfect amount of potatoes and green beans. Just enough food without feeling like a piggy. \n\nAnd then we opted out of dessert because we had sweet snacks during the day, but the waiter brought over small samples of sweets which were the perfect touch to a great meal. \nCan't wait to go back!","1223":"I walked in to this joint and was greeted with a smile, went directly to the bar and took a seat. The bartender Amanda was sweet and efficient and she sure knew how to mix a drink. I had The Peach a mixed drink that included bourbon infused dried peaches.  It was so good. We ordered the Bacon popcorn appetizer slightly buttered with salt and pepper, yum. My friend Al had a black and blue and we shared the Johnny Steak and Frites, perfectly cooked medium rare with a Johnny Walker Cream sauce, wow I'm coming back.","1224":"What an amazing piece of property this restaurant is on it is like you're walking into a French countryside mansion. The landscape has sculptures surrounding that you encounter as you enter the restaurant. On the inside it is cozy and inviting. The service was lacking in fine dining etiquette which is why this isn't a five star review. Other than that the food was sensational.  A highly recommended location","1225":"Beer - Sleepy dog on draft all the way.  Lots and lots of other good choices as well.  (I don't know why other bars\/restaurants in town don't offer more choices - why wouldn't you?)\n\nFood - Updated menu and still just as good.  Pork rinds that are just plain fun - still popping when they arrive.  Recently tried the fish and chips and - I haven't been to a bar in quite a while that breads real fish (instead of some frozen fish mixture fillet concoction.)  But, we are in Arizona so obviously The Parish's fish is frozen too but it looks and tastes like real fish.  Fries are always great too.\n\nTruthfully, I haven't had a single thing on their menu that I didn't like.\n\nService - I just love this place.  I don't go in late so I don't know how the crowd is at night but around 4:00 - it's just so laid back.  Great place to go have a beer and an early dinner.  Service is good.  Company is good.","1226":"So far, Yes, I am a fan!! I have to say it's been a pleasure so far working with Emily Carr in the events department. I called just a week in advance to try to book a brunch which she informed was booked especially for such a large party of almost 30. In return she offered to put us in the Pavilion and have it to ourselves!!! The party is this sunday and i hope to be back to let you know all about it!!","1227":"Great little place with amazingly huge taste!! Food is well put together, staff is attentive and very knowledgeable about what they offer. I'm not sure about the PM hours but the lunch hour is hopping. Will be back again when in Tucson (November)! cheers!","1228":"I was disappointed after all the hype.  I may have expected to much.  The food was good but nothing exceptional as far as southern food.  No different than what I can easily find in the Northeast. It may be unusual in Tucson.\n\nMore casual than expected and after eating at many other restaurants in the area while staying at the Hilton, I would recommend other restaurants first if you have limited time.","1229":"I did not dislike this place. The drinks were very good.  The food was decent but pretty pricey.  Maybe it just wasn't my thing.","1230":"I was like so excited to try this place for the very first time only to get very disappointed. The service were fantastic but the food hmmm I don't know, it didn't really pass my tastebuds. I love Cajun, we go to New Orleans once a year. Maybe I just have a high standard when it comes to Cajun. The pasta were so rich I don't understand what to expect from it, I hardly ate it, I can taste the alcohol it was so strong. We had the fish as well it was just ok. I probably only liked the hush puppies it was good.  Ohh and the paintings and the ambiance I like. Sorry just stating my honest recent experience.","1231":"I love LOVE this place!!! It's takes me back a dozen years to an old stomping ground. The burgers are GREAT. They don't miss a beat & I'm greater & seated with a smile. Love the gumbo!!!! Great service and food all the time. Please KEEP up the good work!!!!!!","1232":"came here with a bunch of girlfriends for my birthday dinner\nstaff was lovely.\nfood was lovely.\nthe scenery was lovely.\n\ni have no complaints and think that the pictures of this resto alone are enough for you to want to go.\n\nBTW you don't have to pay admission to the grounds to dine at rats (but i highly recommend you go to grounds for sculpture because it was amazing!).","1233":"Terrible service people very upset with everything. When we asked for seating for nine hosts response was \"well that's ambitious\". No manager on site. And twenty open tables. Poor planning on their end.","1234":"Very expensive.   The Sunday buffet has very limited offerings and is not worth the price. This is the only meal I was there for.","1235":"A nice little restaurant with Bayou flair and a creative dinner and drink menu. Good beer and wine selection too. Me and a buddy went tapas style while sitting at the bar. We had four of the apps and all were flavorful and well executed - pimpanada being the best. The gumbo was spicy but lacking substance - like big chunks of meat. The hush-puppies were fantastic. The service from bartenders was acceptable, but not as friendly or attentive as I'd like at an upscale gastro-pub. I would hope table service is better.","1236":"Another amazing dinner.  I started my birthday celebrations last Thursday with my sister and friends!  Shrimp and grits for me, Seafood gumbo for 2 others and fish and chips!  Let's me say the bacon popcorn we had as app was absolutely incredible! Our server was fantastic and even brought me some great bread pudding with a candle to finish up!  I never leave disappointed at The Parish!  Looking forward to my next visit!","1237":"If you live up there, go often, if you don't, just try to go sometime...hotshots, brian lopez and gabriel sullivan's new band, chicha dust, were playing so we went to check it out~ I was super pleased with my pickle vodka martini and the bacon popcorn (a little too salty for even a salt freak) but can't wait to go back and try the carryovers I saw on the menu from the owners old restaurant on grant, the french quarter!  that place had great food.  I shouldn't comment on the interior, because I don't remember it well, but don't make fun of the art in there like i did with my date, because then I found some info on the wall by the front door, and some very special people made the paintings hanging throughout the dining room.  so kudos to the bar for showing the work.","1238":"Unique spot in Tucson and worth every penny! Interesting selection of Cajun cuisine. Loved the fish and chips, homemade corn bread and quail dish. Live music makes it even more worth the trip. Fun date night spot!","1239":"The Parish Burger is the best burger in town. Get it just the way it comes, even if you don't like blue cheese. Trust me. The bacon popcorn is also a must - a perfect way to start the meal or to have a salty pairing with a cold beer.","1240":"The Parish serves the best food in Tucson, hands down. The gumbo is the best single food item in the entire city, and the burger isn't far behind. From the hand cut fries to the bacon popcorn to the amazing cocktail menu to the best operators in town, Steve and Bryce, you can't go wrong here.","1241":"Food not up to the price.  The crowd was mixed dressy and jeans.  Service was uneven.  Wine selection and cocktails were quite good.  The room was a bit chaotic.  For the money, I want the food and the experience to be better.","1242":"Yummy lunch and drinks today more than better service and truly a good experience I'll be back!","1243":"Fun little Cajun restaurant. Great atmosphere, quirky location in a strip mall. Great food and fun live music on the weekends.","1244":"Let's take a great happy hour menu of fries, eggplant caponata, hummus and other things and turn it into a disaster of empanada, tacos, stale peanuts. The wait staff was rude  so definitely will not be returning!","1245":"This place is a gem...stopped in around 11am on a Sunday to see if we could get a table for later but as expected were told there were no tables available but we could sit on the patio now...so we figured we'd do a brunch...now this place is located in the park \"grounds for sculpture\" which is a large well landscaped park with sculptures and art thru out...so we walk out on the patio and are blown away by the landscape which is a recreation of a Monet painting...Japanese bridge...with artificial fog!  We were seated at a table front and center...it was absolutely charming...I'll post a picture of our view...now the food...this is a Starr restaurant so service is impeccable...my wife and I shared the coque Madame which was essentially an open faced cheese and ham sandwich toasted and served with a poached egg on top...sounds simple and it is but the execution was excellent...the egg yolk mixed with the sandwich was delightful...we also shares a crispy shrimp salad that was perfectly dressed and the shrimp done right...I also had the bacon infused Bloody Mary...Starr restaurants always produce at a high level...this is my 5th one...serpico in phila is at the top of my all time list...","1246":"I wanted to like this place a lot because I do love Cajun food and culture.  However, I was disappointed. The ambiance is fine. Noisy, but after all it is a bar.  The food just seemed to fall flat.  The chicken gumbo was mush and the taste was of the throw-a-lot-of-hot-sauce-on-it variety that has no taste beneath the \"hot.\" The hush puppies were rather boring and disappointing. We tried the bread pudding, which is one of my favorite things about New Orleans, and didn't care for the embellishment of chocolate. Bring back the traditional whiskey sauce. Cheerful, helpful service and reasonable prices, though.","1247":"One of the best places on the North side of town. \n\nWe always get the hush puppies to start out with. Their cocktails are really good, as well. \n\nFor an entree I usually get the Drunken Angel pasta. It's insanely good- super flavorful and rich. Shrimp and crawfish and pasta in a saffron lobster red pepper sauce- I've never had a dish with those flavors combined, and it is divine.\n\nIf I don't get the pasta, I go for the Big Hippie burger. It's an eggplant based burger and super good (although messy to eat). I always add goat cheese on top, and I swear, they put a whole goats worth of cheese on it, which is awesome. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the decor, and when they have live music it can be way too loud depending on where you're seated and who's playing, but these are minor quibbles. The food will keep me coming back!\n\nOh also, I'm not sure if they are still doing the magic shows in the parlor room, but I went once and it was great- would make for a great date night.","1248":"The d\u00e9cor is interesting a lot of black tile, eclectic and chic at the same time and jazz music was playing in the background. They have a decent bar with a good selection of craft beers.\n\nThe service was spot on not pushy, but attentive and very friendly. Not that fake \"I'm Josh I'll be you server\"\n\nI do agree with Jennifer P.  that I was under whelmed with the menu. They need to expand it, but I did like what they had. The first item I ordered that looked interesting was a bacon and egg dinner, but they were out of it. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy sandwich. It was cooked perfectly and the bread was fresh. Very delicious, I would order it again.\n\nI got the bread pudding for desert. It's one of my favorite desserts. Most of the time I order it I am disappointed, but this was a treat. It was light and tasty and perfectly cooked. It has a light cr\u00e8me sauce that accented it flawlessly. But the thing that made it stand out was a piece of chocolate dipped bacon that was on the top. Sounds weird but it was awesome. Best bread pudding I have had in AZ. Excellent.","1249":"California native visiting Arizona. The parish has Excellent food and selection of drinks. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Definitely coming back when I'm in town.","1250":"Took my wife for the brunch buffet a couple months ago on a recommendation from a wealthy co-worker who frequents.  The scenery is gorgeous, like a painting.  The restaurant was packed, and we were sat upstairs relatively quickly. The buffet had everything you'd want; lovely salad and charcuterie, eggs benedict, french toast, a carving station where they make you your own omelette.  Some of the food looked like it was sitting out for too long though.  The coffee was fantastic as were the mini pastries.  Although service overall was friendly, I felt they would have been more attentive for such a place, and the servers looked overdressed and kind of uncomfortable (just my opinion).  However, this was the brunch buffet and I would definitely return to order from their regular brunch menu as my wife and I were too stuffed to stay and walk around their beautiful sculpture gardens.  Overall opinion:  Overpriced, but delicious with a truly unique atmosphere.","1251":"1. Definitely make a reservation if you can- we went on a weekday for lunch w\/ a reservation, but there were people who walked in and were told the next available slot was 4 hours later. \n\n2. Really good bread that comes with this herb-y butter spread. I think I ate like 6 slices throughout the meal, heehee.\n\n3. Amazing French onion soup, with cheese baked\/melted over. Yummm!\n\n4. Seafood salad... I didn't enjoy as much. Next time will definitely ask for dressing on the side, because there was way too much in the salad and it tasted a bit sour.\n\nAll in all 4\/5, would go again!","1252":"Good spot ... Best part they are open during the lunch time unlike the other places that are rated high on yelp! \n\nFood is very tasty and personnel is very friendly!\n\nNext time we drive from San Francisco to AZ we will definitely stop by!","1253":"This was a great start to our brief stay in Tucson.  We started with some well crafted cocktails.  The hubs claims it was the best Sazerac he ever had.\n\nWe had some nice oysters on the half shell with a yummy smokey cocktail sauce.\n\nI had the smokin angel with shrimp. I'm not typically a huge fan of too many smokey flavors in one meal, but this was a huge exception. \n\nMy husband had the mussels with chorizo. They were some of the best mussels I've had.\n\nComfortable atmosphere too with a nice NOLA vibe.","1254":"Delicious food, very cozy d\u00e9cor.  I had the salmon, which seemed like a smaller than normal portion but between apps, entr\u00e9e and dessert I was definitely full at the end.  A couple of others in our group had the beef bourguignon and it was also delicious.  It was interesting that they served a piece of bread at the beginning and then before the entr\u00e9e brought out popovers.  Not bad, just different.  Unfortunately, it was pouring rain the day I went but I understand there is a lovely sculpture garden on the property.","1255":"Ate here for a wedding and the grounds are just stunning. Lovely restaurant with lots of cozy nooks and great views. I eat vegan most of the time and they were able to accommodate with decent options.","1256":"Great food!Fun atmosphere!\nCame here for a graduation celebration dinner and the service for our group of 10 was excellent Highly recommend - the gumbo is delicious -just the right amount of spice and probably the best burger ever","1257":"Been there twice probably gonna hold off for a while... needs some work inside but that really has nothing to do with my 3 star.  Food was pretty good, drinks were lame, uninventive and some lacked flavor.  I know infusions are cool these days but not when you just put freakin' candy in them... that's not infusing anything, that's dissolving. Ton's of fried stuff and not to many ways around it if you're not into it like my wife.  Pretzels were good, shrimp fritters were greasy.  I had the pork... good flavor.  \n\nWaitress was nice enough, lacked any enthusiasim and it was a pretty slow experiance but that's what we were going for, fortunatly.\n\nI just feel like that spot is cursed... good luck.","1258":"Stopped here with a friend, who had never been before, for the anticipated happy hour. . They have around 5 beers on tap but only one beer qualified for \"happy hour.\"\nWe tried the Gorgonzola cheese plate with 2-3 small seeded grapes and almonds, not worth the price. \nOverall, a pleasant experience sitting at the largest pewter bar in the US (with a roaring fire behind us) and friendly clientele.","1259":"Wonderfull place to go hang or have a romantic dinner.  Great food very well priced. Bartender was so much fun.  The whole fam food was wonderful and cooked beautifully.","1260":"Yum. Pretty good food here. Ordered the frog legs wrapped in bacon. They had a green onion dip w\/it. They were good. They really did taste a lot like chicken. \n\nMy bf ordered a shrimp po'boy with a side of gumbo.I ordered the spicy Haitian pulled pork and also the gumbo. His po'boy was ok. The proportions were off. There was too much bread and too little shrimp and filling. It was a bland tasting sandwich. \n\nMy spicy Haitian pulled pork was pretty amazing. It is very spicy so if you're not a fan of spice I wouldn't get this. The flavors were great. It was topped w\/cilantro and coleslaw. Yum!! \n\nGumbo!!! My first time having gumbo and it was great! Nice and hot. Flavors were fantastic. Big pieces of andouille sausage and shredded chicken. Quite good. \n\nThe menu is kind of small but as far as I could tell from our order, they're more about quality of food over quantity. And I am a fan of that!\n\nP.s. The decor was very hip. I loved the abstract art on the walls.","1261":"Mmm... Just ate. The staff was friendly, the service prompt. When I ordered a beer, the waitress said, \"Are you sure? Lemme give you a sample first.\" Sure enough, it wasn't for me. I switched. N.b., no generic beers here: a gourmet craft selection.\n\nAs for the rest, the bacon popcorn is definitely worthwhile.we're taking some home. My wife had shrimp and grits(with superb collard greens) and I had gumbo (spicy, no need for the hot sauce they offered). Even the hushpuppies were good: a rarity.\n\nA place like this makes me glad I take a gamble on Yelp advice now and then.","1262":"fantastic, we stopped in for a late lunch.,after touring the grounds.   service was great by a waiter named JOE  if he was busy with something else another waiter would jump in they where all great . my wife had the burger cooked just the way she liked it. she said the cheese could of been 10 seconds early .  she would of gave it 5+ stars. oh they kept filling her ice tea .  i had the muslels they where great .  wine by the glass  was a good choice.  there bread very good . nice touch with the salt sprinkled on top of it. the place was a nice touch after touring the grounds. i will be back its  a hour drive for me but worth it .  we where there on sept 16. this is not a french resturant . but a AMERICAN resturant . with a  french flavour  fine taste","1263":"Went here for lunch with my sister. At first I surprised at such a small menu. my sister had a Bloody Mary and the fish and chips. I got my  blue cheese burger with fries. It was really good and I'm convinced that a small menu is in no way a reflection of the quality of the food. I will definitely be back sometime for lunch.","1264":"Beautiful. Whimsical setting. Felt like we were dining in a dream (or a movie set). Food was on point (though pricey). We had the:\n\nOnion soup - winner\ncold cream based soup - winner\nsalmon tartine - was expecting it to be outstanding per reviews but i could pass on this. Le Pain Quotidien has a similar version. \nCrispy Shrimp Salad - the shrimp were outstanding. the salad wasn't my favorite. So like a child, i ate all the shrimp and picked around the rest ;)\naubegine\/feta - great vegetarian option\nmezze platter - good sized portion, enough for two people to share. in fact ALL the entrees were huge and could be shared by two people. which would cut down the cost!\nprofiteroles - well done\n\nLastly - great service. we had a nice long leisurely lunch for our friends bday. It's a great place for a date or a to bring someone for a special occassion.","1265":"Started with drinks. Hand squeezed lemon and lime juice really makes a difference. All cocktails are made with house infused spirits and are well crafted. Food was supreme. I mean southern and butter rhyme for a reason. I had the drunk enough pasta and over ate because it was so good. Lastly, as we walked out of the restaurant every single staff personnel said a friendly thank you and goodbye! Will return to try the hush puppies and Gumbo.","1266":"Come to Tucson as a tourist and pop into The Parish, was surprised by the food here, and also the atmosphere, decoration, friendly staff Thomas and everything here. Definitely recommended, try the food here, your wont regret and all are really good tasted. Like drunken angel the most.","1267":"The parish is all around pretty damn good. Its got a nice sized bar for the football fan deep inside of you. The foodie living in your stomach will pop out and dance with joy like a scene from spaceballs! \nMy dad and I went on a Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised to see a sizable bar to cozy up at. They had some nice local brews to choose from as well as the usual chuggers. The staff was very nice and helpful when needed. We ordered a gumbo to cut the edge off of our severe hunger pains. Its was pretty good, it had some kick to it like it should. We then shared the oyster\/shrimp po-boy and the pork sandwich. Both were on the DOPE side of the spectrum. \nOver all the Parish will be a spot that I will frequent for a beer and some delicious goodies for the alien living in my stomach.","1268":"Nice place to sit and enjoy the quiet and of course the view, but that's about it. Very limited tap beer selection, don't even think about ordering something outside of the good old burgers and fries, sat down for happy hour and got a chance to sample everything in small sample sizes. BURGER AND FRIES, were the only edible things. To be honest, I guess if you are located in the place like this and have no competition, you basically can do and serve whatever and people will still come.","1269":"It's Denise's 29 and and a half birthday! Again.\n\nMy first time into The Parish and it's warm and smells of red blooded meat.  That might turn some of you off.  Not me.  I was ready to knife and fork it all the way.  Until I looked at the menu.  And something else caught my eye...\n\nWe reserved a table for 10, I think, and used up all the seats.  The waitress was okay...she confused me with a woman, a friend of mine, who asked to exchange seats and then brought us both the wrong drinks.  Drinks that didn't belong to either one of us.  Drinks that belonged somewhere else.\n\nMeantime, we had the bacon popcorn and the craw-fish hush puppies.  The p-corn was tasty--for p-corn--but a lot of the bacon was burnt, the onions overwhelming, the whole underly so....But, what a profit margin!  A bag of popcorn is what, .25 cents?  Add some bacon and green onion and your golden.  I think some caramel corn, the likes of which was melty enough that the bacon and onion stuck, might justify the gougingish of this appetizer's existence.  You..?\n\nWe imbibed.  I sipped a few Dragoon IPA's and an Oberon.  Yummy in my empty tummy.  Then I got up--the emptiness of said vestibule making the almost-table-knocking-over the more apparent.  Thank God I wasn't driving...\n\nWe laughed, we commiserated, we bespoke our tales of woe and wonder, and then we ordered.  I can only speak of my pulled-pork Adoba; not adobada, but as darn tootin' tastiliciousness as ever a BBQ pork sandwich was.  And, huge?  Yes, enormous.  A perfect (maybe potatoe?) roll, a heap o'that BBQ pulled pork of theirs, a giant dill pickle spear and some of that coleslaw.  That coleslaw.  You have to try that coleslaw.  Even if, like me, you don't like coleslaw.  C-o-l-e-s-l-a-w.  Get it.\n\nSpicy fries.  The ketchup was store bought--sad news bears.  But, the lemon bleu-cheese dressing zinged and melted in my eager mouth.  It's worth ordering a pre-dinner salad.  Some of the tomatoes are purple and sweet.  Some are green and tangy.  Some are small and red and round.  The cucumbers are large and crisp and the mix of greens and romaine is perfection.  \n\nCarnivore or herbivore, do it up.  This place has that modern southern cooking down.\n\n-Fairy Food Father","1270":"Highly recommend this restaurant from the friendly staff, great tasty strong drinks, and excellent southern theme culinary delight! Check it out you won't be disappointed :)","1271":"Wow, solid all round.  Great food cooked perfectly.  Cocktails excellent and well priced.  Great waitstaff, cozy and warm interior.  Friend had awesome Tchoup, others killer steak with greens and drunken angel pasta with seafood.   Bread pudding awesome, even their sweet tea is perfection!","1272":"I have been to the Parish several times. The food has always been very good and the service is excellent. They have a happy hour that is very reasonable with a variety of draft beers,cocktails and wines and their selection of appetizers.  I really like their gumbo, they have great hamburgers, and the bacon popcorn is awesome. I would highly recommend this place to enjoy food and drink with friends","1273":"Because there was ingenuity behind the plates, I wanted to like the food more but the end result left me puzzled.\n\nThe crawfish hushpuppies were a good idea because they are two wonderful ingredients, but where was the crawfish? The key ingredient was lost and further buried by the overly dark deep frying.\n\nCombining frog legs and bacon with a spicy kick from horseradish and creole remoulade was a good idea, but what's the point of serving frog legs if you're just going to make them taste like chicken. Where is the amphibious funk? Also, be careful while eating because of the bones.\n\nFried pork rinds that popped and crackled when served was a good idea. It sounded great, but tasted like Styrofoam.\n\nTransforming grits into a white cheddar grit cake as a base for the shrimp was a good idea, but why make the exterior skin so thick? Why drown the shrimp and grits in a \"Creole BBQ cream sauce\" that neither tasted Creole nor BBQ? Why use small, flavorless shrimp? To make things worse, the side of southern greens was harshly home-styled to the point they were difficult to eat.\n\nSoaking pasta in alcohol for the \"Drunken Angel\" was a good idea, but why use cheap red wine? The wine wasn't going to cook down. Why use saffron? Saffron is one of the most expensive ingredients in the world. It's something chefs don't waste in a spicy arrabbiata-like sauce that was filled with garlic to the point where the saffron was hardly noticeable. Why put so much bread (a waitress mockingly called it a \"loaf\") on top of the pasta bowl? Not only was it carbs on more carbs, it was flavored like something from the disgusting Olive Garden (which doesn't realize that olives grow on trees in groves, not in gardens). Granted, there was good flavor from the crawfish and lobster broth, but why use so much cream sauce, again? And to top it all off, the pasta was overcooked and mushy.\n\nGastropubs frequently have smaller food items or \"bites\". No need to worry about not getting enough food here. The plates are plenty big so you don't \"parish\". Basically, don't order more than two plates per person.\n\nDespite the repeated use of ginger ale, mint, and cucumber infused liquors when cucumbers aren't in season, the best thing about The Parish was the cocktails and the main thing saving the place from 2-stars. The Caribbean Mule was clearly the top drink of the night with its cold brightness.\n\nTucson is a town so small they get confused when I give a phone number. They don't expect the area code or The Parish doesn't expect many out-of-towners. The clientele also seemed confused where silly parents celebrate their infant's birthday with the baby in tow. Who does that? This is a gastropub, not a Chuck E. Cheese. Service was not properly coordinated between staff members.","1274":"Ate here on a recent trip down to Tucson and let me tell you this place was great! For starters they had a wide selection of beers but I dove right into some of their signature cocktails all of which were very good and had a few different ones throughout my meal. My favorite would probably be \"the doctor\" which was made with Makers Mark and Hennessy. To start the meal we went with the bacon popcorn which was freakin delicious! Huge chunks of bacon all over the popcorn with some sort of tasty oil drizzled all over it as well. For my main dish the waitress helped me out as at first I was going to get the spicy pork which she told me was extremely spicy so I passed. Then I was going to go with the flat bread which she told me was very olivey (I've had tapenade in the past so I thought it would be okay but I'm not a huge fan of olives so I decided to pass). I eventually settled on their parish burger which was a pretty decent burger but the star of my meal was this delicious charred onion dipping sauce I ordered for my french fries (a extra buck well worth it!) The stuff was so delicious I would probably put it on anything. It was a onion type of aioli sauce which I really enjoyed. This place is definitely a place I would come back to. The food was excellent and the staff very friendly.","1275":"This is our second visits to this restaurant as we were disappointed in the dinner menu and would try lunch. So here is our lunch review, again the place gets many points for ambience and service. The outside seating is always a plus and this time no annoying ducks or poop spread across the patio as with our previous experience. The lunch menu had a few extra choices than dinner. Now for the food we all had burgers kind of boring but was gun shy from the last experience. At $18.00 bucks a burger the quality was good and the specialty sauce was very good. The french fries were done just right. We shared a dessert of rice pudding in a crispy, sweet light filo shell that was also good. So overall  3 - 3.5 stars if the food was just slightly better and more choices would get 4 stars easily.","1276":"The food here merits 4 stars, but with the exceptional service and elegant ambiance, I'm giving Rat's a full five. I came here for lunch. For appetizers we ordered the provencal mezze, which was refreshingly delicious and large enough to share among 3 people. The smoked salmon tartine was also good and the free bread with herb butter was scrumptious. They had a kid's menu as well!\nI do think the appetizers were the best part of the meal. For entrees, I ordered the simply seared market seafood, which that day was a red snapper. Although it was perfectly cooked and tender, it was rather flavorless and the salmoriglio sauce too salty for my taste. The mussels and frites were good, although not exceptional. The chicken schnitzel was the best of all three. However, the ingredients were extremely fresh and the presentation beautiful. The portions are very filling. Dessert was absolutely delicious, if pricey.- I ordered a caramel carrot cake with fresh pea ice cream. The bill came to about $30-35 a person, but it was worth it. Happy hour (4-7pm) is a great deal.\nOur server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She made sure our drinks were always refilled and was very attentive. The restaurant decor is beautiful. Inside is reminiscent of a steakhouse and the outside is a Monet painting come to life. Before, admission to the sculpture park was free with a meal at Rat's, but now they charge $15\/person ($6 after 6pm, but you don't get admission to the indoor galleries). Still, if you walk around Rats' grounds, you will find ample sculptures. Don't be afraid to wander around the narrow paths, get close to the water, or walk inside the forest.","1277":"This place is fantastic. they have sweet tea. Real southern sweet tea. The frog legs wrapped in bacon were delicious. The service was exceptional. The Cuban sandwich and  Po boy were flavorful. My only regret is that I was too full to have the bourbon bread pudding","1278":"Omg, the BEST pasta dish I have ever had! It was called the Drunken Angel?  And my friend got the chili relleno off the appetizer menu- also great, but mine was the best!  Can't wait to return to the Parish...maybe next week","1279":"I've been here many times while I was living in Tucson! Great foods and great atmosphere. I always get the drunken angel and it is delicious. Their pork rinds are also great. I wasn't a fan of the frog legs but it was not too bad. Wide variety of drinks! Highly recommend this place.","1280":"Yummy food! Great music! Love this place! \n\nI have had the smoking angel, which was so yummy! And the shrimp and grits make me feel loved me I am in the south! Their hush puppies are super tasty as well!","1281":"their food i amazing. i have tried almost everything on their menu and it is all fabulous. my husband is a vegetarian and they were really willing to adjust their dishes to be veggie friendly. the service is great they are very friendly and clearly love the place they are working. they also have a wide selection of some really cool cocktails and a full bar. the interior is beautifully decorated and very clean. i will come back here again and again.","1282":"Always my go to whether it be just a beverage or a bite to eat! Staff and management the best!\n\nKeep it up 'The Parish'!","1283":"The grounds are beautiful, the food ok, the waiter charming, but the host was ARROGANT!  Not a very good first impression.","1284":"Place was still packed at 8 pm on Friday night. I found a place at the bar next to a tenacious drunk local. I would say dinner was doomed from the start! The goat cheese relleno reminded me more of warm sour cream with bacon on top. I enjoyed the chef's special chili pork roast with root vegetables. I probably wouldn't go back (definitely not back to that bar situation lol) unless I had reservations or a dinner partner.","1285":"The oysters are out of this world. I wish I could have eaten a dozen of them. And up to this point I've never really been a fan of oysters. Drunken angel pasta is amazing. I don't think I've ever tasted a pasta quite like it. The pasta is cooked in burgundy and served with a sea food medley. Seriously rich and wonderful. Frog legs were great as well. Jon, one of the bartenders, knows his craft. He consistently makes my drinks to perfection and on occasion has offered up new creations based on what I like. All around well priced for the quality. Highly recommend!","1286":"The Parish has some delicious gumbo and burgers. Their service was great and food came out quickly for a Friday night. Only disappointment was their edamame. My boyfriend and I drowned it in hot sauce to make it taste decent. Otherwise it was very bland and cheap tasting, although expensive.","1287":"The parish is my favorite place in Tucson. Steak salad and a glass of wine yes! I had a little birthday party here a while back and even though my friends were being annoying we were all coming and going they handled us with grace. Love the late night menu and great full bar.","1288":"last two times the service (lack there of) has spoiled what could be a nice place.  Once for lunch & most recently for dinner & both times with others and we all felt the same way.  Food is ok albeit pricey.  But service ruined it.  Needs a lot of improvement","1289":"The restaurant's setting on the water and the overall ambiance is spectacular. However, the food is overpriced and is far from spectacular. For lunch, we had a cheese board (3 very small cubes of plain-tasting cheeses) with cold bread, followed by the \"wild boar over polenta\". What we had was not polenta but some form of bland grits and the meat came in a ridiculously small portion. The cocktail known as \"High Tea\" was not a well-thought-out combination of flavors. Rat's is not the place to go if you have an appetite for tasty food. \n\nI know that the menu and the kitchen here have seen better days. Previous visits (about three years ago) were far more satisfying.","1290":"Great atmosphere. Amazing food!! The service can sometimes be a little rough but most of the servers & staff do exceptionally well. We continue to come back for the Happy Hour & delicious apps. If you ever get the chance to eat off the dinner menu I suggest bringing a bigger party. So that it just becomes a buffet of delicious plates to try.","1291":"I am really impressed. So impressed that I've been there for lunch twice this week, planning a happy hour with my team at work within the next month, and have already made reservations for my wedding anniversary. \n\nI already heard about this place since I was looking into events for my preschooler at Grounds for Sculpture, but wasn't really pressed on giving it a try. One of co-workers decided on this place on a BEAUTIFUL day this past week. And, boy, I'm so glad that she did. What an  aesthetically impressive place. When you first drive around in front of the doors, you feel like you're in an English countryside spot, not in Trenton, NJ. LOL. Beautiful sculptures are strategically placed about--but, warning, beware that you may ask one of them for the time--so lifelike! We sat at the bar and had a delicious lunch. I got the burger--even though I asked for medium, I did feel as though it was WAY overdone. The \"secret sauce\" seems to be a more quality take on Big Mac sauce--which I love, so I asked for more. My friend got the turkey sandwich, which she stated was a little \"light\" for her. Guess she should have gotten the burger like me. LOL. \n\nThe absolute highlight was after lunch, she took me on a mini tour of the grounds outside of the restaurant. I was beyond impressed at the beautiful pond with Koi fish happily swimming around. But, the sculptures in the back are so awesome. I mean, who doesn't love art with their meal?\n\nFAST FORWARD:\n\nThe next day, went back with some other co-workers and tried the Croque Madame. Yum, yum, yum. French delight. I asked for some of the cherry chutney I'd seen that was paired with another meal because I knew it would compliment it perfectly, and it did! My co-workers both thoroughly enjoyed their short ribs and fries. Did I say that these are the best fries I've ever tasted? Well, I know it is a FRENCH restaurant, but still. LOL.\n\nGood job, Rat's. I'm a fan.","1292":"One of the most lovely, delicious, warming in front of the fireplace on an oriental carpet with a modern twist on French cooking.... The service is amazing.... The atmosphere is warm and relaxing and you feel like you transformed until another time. I would highly recommend this restaurant on the \"Grounds for Sculpture\". It is pure romantic heaven. This was my 4th visit and certainly the best...The first was for an outstanding lunch, the second was for an Amazing \"Valentine's Day\", the 3rd was for a truly fun Halloween Party with dinner and a DJ and the 4th was a romantic dinner and we sat in front of a huge fireplace for dessert, coffee and after-dinner drinks. Truly a special place....","1293":"We did get to the restaurant early so we could walk around and check out what everyone was saying in the reviews.  We did check in with the hostess and made her aware that we would be at the bar.  We just review our drinks and she was back.  We asked for additional time since we were not finished our first drink.  Here comes again on her broom.  You must be seated now. Wow really....... But the food was really good and the outdoors are absolutely fabulous.  I would certainly say get there early and walk the gardens.  It turned out to be a wonderful evening.  Definitely take in the surroundings and sit outside if possible.","1294":"Rat's Restaurant is one of my favorite places to dine. My wife and I go to it for special occasions. The ambiance is classy, and the food is great.  I like how there are sculptures on the grounds of the restaurant so you can show the place to newcomers.  It's a French restaurant, but this summer the menu has an Asian influence. Recently, I took a party of five there. We ordered the Berkshire Pork, Short Ribs, Duck and Halibut.  I was pleasantly surprised by the pork because it tasted of five spice.  The Halibut was also perfectly cooked (and also had an Asian influence).  The duck was also amazing; the skin of the duck just melts in your mouth. Yes, I tried everyone's dish.  \n\nWe tried various appetizers and also the desserts.  The dessert I enjoyed the most was the carrot cake.  It came with sweet pea flavored ice cream.","1295":"This place is magical!! \nService is a bit off, as in slow and very inattentive, however  the atmosphere and food makes up for it. \nWe sat outside on the patio, and it felt as if we were  a part of a beautiful painting. \nIf you are spending your day at the Grounds For Sculpture park this place is a must try, but make reservations in advance as it gets pretty packed.","1296":"Awesome happy hour! Food is delicious, drinks are creative and the setting is flawless. Very happy place, very happy hour :-). If you are looking for cheap this is not the place, but the food and setting more than makes up for it. The service is prompt and friendly. We had a great experience here.","1297":"too expensive-the surroundings are very nice-food is good but for those especially seniors-counting their pennies--too costly","1298":"Absolutely loved it! Our waiter was the sweetest, atmosphere was amazing. I had chicken, and it was delicious, tender and flavored... Highly recommended","1299":"We visited The Parish on a Saturday night & there was no wait. Service was fairly quick but I have to note, this is not a kid friendly place nor is it conducive to a quiet table for two..the place is very loud & cramped.\n\nWe ordered and ice tea & soda, they came fairly quick but the ice tea tasted like water.  We decided to try the pulled pork & fish & chips with hush puppies.\n\nThe portions were mediocre, one thin piece of fish about 3x4 on a plate of fries. The dipping sauce was a mayo based sauce, and it was tasty, as were the fries. The hush puppies were very good.\n\nThe pork sandwich was very over powering and extremely spicy. Spicy generally means spice..not so hot you can't finish it. The presentation of the food is very nice..but presentation doesn't fill you up.\n\nAll in all it was a good try at a meal, but we did leave hungry simply because we could not finish the sandwich and there was one piece of fish...but that wasn't the worst of it.\n\n My husband tends to get major headaches when cheap oil like canola or soy is used..and sure enough, within a half hour of leaving this place we both had severe headaches and body cramps. We felt like we had been hit by a Mack truck. \n\nThe pains passed in about 3 hours. \n\nAll in all, I say May's Counter - another sports bar type place, has better food, better atmosphere, better portions and we can eat there without feeling like crap.","1300":"Great place with lots of lovely agriculture. Food was a little different than typical brunch places, but overall the cocktails were amazing and unique.","1301":"Good food and drinks! Love the environment too! I've been three times so far and each time there was a live band and a dance floor. So much fun! First time I went was for Fat Tuesday and the band was amazing and they gave away Mardi Gras beads. Very festive. I love the hush puppies, porkchops, and greens. Funny time and good food!!","1302":"I went to Parish for lunch with a coworker after reading the glowing reviews here on yelp.  My experience was not bad but also not likely to make me rush back.  There are several comments on the decor and I did not have a problem with that.  Maybe they have spruced the place up prior to my visit, but I found it inviting.  They have used a lot of color, some art work and have smallish tvs every direction you look.  There is a weird little loungey area in the back that looks like it should be in a hookah bar.  \n\nWe were greeted from someone behind the bar as soon as we walked in and told to sit where we like - OK - no problem.  \n\nOur server sought us out quickly and offered drinks.  We decided to split the shrimp po' boy and the jamaican jerk pulled pork sandwich - both with hand cut fries.  We didn't wait too long for our food and when it arrived it was hot.  We both liked the po'boy better than the pulled pork, but it was not spectacular - It could have used more shrimp - the ones there were tasty - but I had to strategically move them around to get shrimp in every bite.  The pulled pork had a little too much of a spice that neither of us enjoyed.  I normally like jerk spices and I realize that like curries they can vary a lot, this one was not to my liking and I found the pork a little to mushy.  Both sandwiches had more bread than filling.  The fries were good - hot, slightly salty, cooked to a nice golden brown.  \n\nThe one thing that bothered me the most about my experience was that both of the two women that served us had long hair and wore it down.  To all Servers - please wear clean clothes (no animal or human hair bleh) and wear your hair back!  I dont want anyone's hair in my food, near my food, hanging over me or my food ....","1303":"We ate there last night for dinner and it was excellent.  My wife and her sister had the Smokin Angel pasta dish and they loved it; spicy but not over the top.  I had the Drunkin Angel with the seafood and it was excellent; similarly spiced to the Smokin Angel with extra garlic and it was delicious.  The other member of our party had the Fish n Chips which he said were tasty.  For an appetizer we had the Crawfish Hushpuppies with green onion dip; they were delicious.  The service was very good.  We will return and I recommend this restaurant; especially if you want food of a different character.","1304":"We made reservations via the Yelp app and it worked perfectly! They were ready for us when we arrived. \n\nThere were four of us so we started with the bacon popcorn and the crawfish hush puppies. Both delicious however somewhat rich.\n\nTwo of us had the gumbo, our friend had the pulled pork and my husband had the drunken angel. All meals were delicious with generous portions. \n\nThe one opportunity was the service. We had to find our server to fill our drinks. If the service was more attentive I would have given a 5 star review. We will try this place again.","1305":"This is my favorite place to treat myself. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeat cocktails.  Excellent food. Fries are also amazing. \n\nIf budget was not an issue, I'd eat here every day.","1306":"I'm surprised this place was this empty on a Sunday morning.  The food is excellent!  These guys absolutely deserve your business. \n\nHighly recommended for a unique and flavorful brunch!!!","1307":"Tucson being the small town it is, and sometimes not.  I had never even heard of the place until running in to Jon the bartender Saturday, then when I went to do my taxes Bryce my tax guy told me he was on e of the owners.  I don't go north of River to often but did tonight.  I had the Parish burger and it was the bomb, fresh cut fries, almost too much food.  Sat on the patio, not super big but adequate, the service was great.  Small place and wasn't super crowded.  Even tough it is out of my normal stomping grounds I will go back again and again.","1308":"Me and my wife decided to have a date night and in our previous visits to sculpture grounds, we had seen Rt's restaurant and we thought \"wouldn't it be wonderful to have dinner here?\" so we did it. Well, from my perspective there are number of things that make up the fine dining experience: \n1- Food (4 stars): It was great but not the best. With my wife we agreed we have been to better places but nevertheless food tasted good and nice. we enjoyed the food for sure and I don't think it would be fair to rate it less. I had the Kobe Beef Coulotte ($38) and my wife has their special for that night, Ribeye ($58). Both were very nice. Starters (Artisanal Cheese 3 for $15 and grilled spanish Octopus $14) were also nice. We had a Riesling Dr Loosen to go with that followed by Creme Brulee (my favorite) and Corn Panna Cotta (less nice in my view) at $9 each.\n2- Service (5 stars) I had mixed feelings about service. The server, Joshua was very professional and detailed. Only two caveats: we asked him to take a photo of us and he was very hesitant but eventually took few photos. Our water was never refilled and I had to drink from my wife's glass eventually. But our server made it up to us by guiding us to the nice corner of the garden which was very nice of him. Hence 5 star overall to him. Food was also served fast and nice.\n3- Ambiance (5 stars) I think looking at the photos you can tell how it was\n4- Cleanness (4 stars) I always believe the level of hygiene in a restaurant an be decided by a visit to the restroom. Well, admittedly it was late at night so perhaps the restroom was in better shape earlier but there was rubbish on the floor and soap dispenser was broken and the container inside it was on the bath basin so I tried to squeeze some soap out of it. I was not pleased. \nOverall a nice and pleasant place and we both loved the experience.","1309":"DON'T plan to hold an event here!  The atmosphere is terrific, and they promise you everything, but when they have have your $, they quickly move on to other prospective clients....The waiters who served hors deurves didn't speak English (to describe what they were passing), there was no one overseeing the dining room.  We had a family-style plan that we had paid for (meaning if a table ran out of an item, they would replace it).  Not only did they not do that, but when we complained, they moved a half-eaten platter from another table and gave it to us!!  Gross!!!  It was too bad, because we all had high hopes for this occasion at this particular place.  No one who attended was impressed.","1310":"Beautiful restaurant and friendly waitstaff.  Unfortunately, food was terrible.  Tough steak and cold mashed potatoes.  From party of four- all entrees were sub par.  I've heard this restaurant was much better when Kevin Sbraga was the executive chef....","1311":"Better come here at off hours..  It gets pretty crowded.  However, the servers are hopping and really on the job.\n\nNot really Southern cooking, the small menu is better-described as Southern-inspired.\n\nI got the Parish burger, one of the few pre-made burger offerings I'd ever seen that I liked.  ANd a cup of gumbo, which was genuinely gumbo-like, without being too bitter.\n\nThe pork rinds appetizer is vastly more expensive than the stuff you buy at a grocer's in a bag.  It is, however, also vastly fresher.\n\nNOTE: I took this down from 5 stars to 3 - because the food was still good - when I received my credit card bill and discovered that the restaurant had without notice decided to increase my tip.  Not by enough to make it worthwhile for me to contest the charge with my credit card company, but even if the tip is chintzy, which I don't believe mine was, you don't get to change it unilaterally.\n\nIf I ever return here, which I probably won't, I'll pay by cash only, and if they don't like my tip now, they'll really dislike what I'll leave them then.","1312":"A few weeks ago i wrote about my experience with booking a party. We had to reschedule due to Hurricane Sandy.  Yesterday we finally had our 80th birthday party for my mom. It was so amazing. Everyone who attended was blown away by the place the service, Thank You Harry and Jeff!!!! The food was delicious!! Though I didn't love the pumpkin creme brulee the rats chocolate cake by far made up for it. It was chilly so we couldn't spend too much time on the grounds but I cannot wait to get back. It was a day to remember.","1313":"I love this place. First of all, great drink list and decor. Second, they have a terrific little room for parties of 5-10. They also offer indoor and outdoor seating options. I was skeptical of Cajun food in Tucson but this place is great. Bacons popcorn, hush puppies, and a pulled pork sandwich I keep going back for.","1314":"Let me get this out of the way right now: the shrimp po boy is to die for. The hushpuppies and the remoulade dipping sauce for them are both excellent. My wife got the gumbo for the main course and it was a little too spicy for her taste. I ended up giving her half of my po boy and finishing the gumbo for her. It wasn't the best i've had, but it was still pretty good. We got the bacon popcorn as an appetizer. It wasn't something I would order again, but it wasn't bad. I also had a sip of my wife's mixed drink, cannot recall what it was called but it had cucumber flavoring and agave tequila and some other stuff, and it too was very good. The sweet tea is exceptional. Service was friendly. If you could give ratings in half-star increments, I would give this place 4 and a half stars, and I will definitely be back.","1315":"We tried The Parish for Sunday Brunch and enjoyed most everything.  The hamburger was great, and cooked to order.  The Croque Madame was wonderful.  The Haitian Pork Sandwich was really spicy! The cornmeal crusted soft shell crab was O.K., but there was just a little too much of too many flavors.  The service was great!     \n All in all, a fun place to try.","1316":"Anyone that gave this place a poor review should just go back to McDonalds.\n\nFor everyone else that wants a perfect date or dinner; pick Rats.\n\nThe Kabul lounge is a great place to bring a date for a relaxed, comfortable time without that awkward pretentious feeling.  Grab a drink, head outside for the sculptures and sauna houses.\n\nIts crazy out there\nEnjoy it","1317":"The Parish has a clear point of view, from food, to cocktails, to decor -- and they fully deliver every time. The Dutch Well Water cocktail and The Parishoner are both faves. It's hard to resist the gumbo, so I almost always get that, but my one foray into shrimp and grits was also rewarding. My husband's mom is from Mississippi and he says the gumbo is what he grew up on -- there can be no higher praise from him. It's a busy place, very lively and somewhat noisy, but it is really fantastic.","1318":"Great place! Had The Parish Burger and it was delicious. Had a taste of some local beers and a nice rye whiskey for very reasonable price. Will definitely eat here again next time I'm in town!","1319":"What an gorgeous and amazing restaurant! From the decor, the ambiance, the ground sculptures to the drinks and food. \n\nAt 7:30 we went to our dining area which was perfect and were greeted with delightful staff! They started us off with some Dark Horse wine and different gourmet breads. Also a little taste of a ceviche kinda thing but made with gazpacho! Yum! \n\nWe then had a huge variety of first and second courses to choose from. I picked scallion cod pancake and duck breast! The cod was very fresh and light. And the duck was seasoned well and very juicy! For dessert I had a chocolate torte that was exquisite! \n\nI can't wait to go back to Rat's again!","1320":"While they have a few kinks to work out, it was a good dining experience. \n\nThe shrimp po-boy was great! The shrimp was perfectly prepared and well seasoned. I also enjoyed the bacon popcorn, though I felt the popcorn tasted a tad bit burnt. The concept is a good one that needs to be perfected. I sampled a classic wing and found the spices to be spot on and the meat to be very juicy, though another diner at my table had an undercooked wing. The hand-cut fries were absolutely perfect. \n\nThe decor left a bit to be desired. I heard someone else say that it felt like eating on 4th Avenue and I agree. I was hoping for something more.\n\nAside from the food (which just needs consistency in quality), the other area that needs improvement is the service. We were greeted right away and asked for drinks in a timely manner by a very friendly person. We later found that she was not our server, but the bartender. The server rarely checked back, and left much to be desired. \n\nI will definitely go back, but will need to talk the other people I ate with into going and giving it a second chance.","1321":"I love this place it's a jewel in a harsh world and we are members, but the bartender's basically suck.   How hard is it to get a good bartender?   This is my only complaint towards Rat's.   One bartender with the long brown hair and glasses starts out good and then leaves you hanging because she's to busy talking to the other bartenders, which distract them from doing their jobs.  This is not a one time thing, it's all of the time.","1322":"Tiny but so worth the wait. You have to try the pretzel bites and the Amazing cheese dipping sauce that has some kick. The fish and chips and gumbo are delicious. I love that the servers don't have to wear some tacky uniform and all look like clones. This place has character that so many other restaurants lack.","1323":"We got married on a Saturday at Rats back in 2007.  To briefly review that experience, I would say it was 5-stars.  Chris Carrell (in charge of event planning) was a very classy guy and made the whole day something we will never forget.  Our food was excellent, the atmosphere was beautiful, and the servers were awesome. If it weren't for the oppressive heat on that day, it would've literally been perfect.\n\nTo review the restaurant, I would have to give 3-4 stars.  I have never been terribly impressed by their appetizers although their entrees are excellent. Service varies but is usually pretty good.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is always wonderful, regardless of where you are seated, but now that the Grounds for Sculpture is pay for admission, that kinda detracts from the experience given the overall price of the meal itself.  We usually come back for our anniversary for nostalgia but it has also been getting a little more difficult to justify the long drive and high meal price when we could get comparable meals for cheaper and much closer to our house. It may seem \"cheap\" of us but we're really not inclined to go spend any more money on the GfS when we just want to reminisce for 10 minutes.\n\nOne last thing - make sure you don't take a wrong turn getting here. We did once and ended up in the ghetto of Trenton.  That was not enjoyable.  The restaurant is located in an industrial business area which is always a little strange.","1324":"Wonderful good and drinks,  entertainment on Tuesday and Sunday evenings.  What a wonderful place to enjoy terrific food.","1325":"Stumbled in here without any expectations was greeted with live music, great service and a fun menu. Service was prompt knowledgeable and friendly thanks Skyler! Loved the Burger I don't live here and wish I could have had two just to enjoy it again!!! \n\nI'm certain everything else on the menu is equally as great. I highly recommend getting in here and having a good time.","1326":"This is my wife and I's new favorite place. Their burgers are excellent and the pulled pork is the best. Their bread pudding is a must have. Always call in a reservation there are not to many tables. The mixed drinks are fun, I personally like the Caribbean mule.","1327":"Ahhh man what can I say?! It's definitely a place I would visit everytime I'm in Tucson. Quite possibly the best meal I've had out here. Theres a relaxing Southern vibe soon as you enter. I can picture a live band playing here on weekends. \n\nI ordered the basil and watermelon cooler and it was very refreshing. It was light but flavorful. Perfect for the summertime. I could sip on those all day poolside. For my meal I had the red trout with collard greens. I'm very picky when it comes to soul food due to my moms southern cooking during the holidays but these collard greens were so good I had to text my mom immediately after the first bite. They definitely rival hers. You can tell that they chef isn't afraid to season the food well. The red trout was delectable as well. They matched perfectly with one another. \n\nThe service was quite exceptional as well and I would definitely come back and spread the word when I return home. This is one restaurant that won't be forgotten.","1328":"I feel like I stepped into New Orleans!  It has that Victorian\/voodoo look going on!  The bar is definitely the highlight of the place, on the shelves are Mason jars filled with their 'house infused' spirits.  So cool looking!!!!\nThe 'hand-crafted cocktails' are amazing!  And the food is to die for!\nWe started with the hush puppies, that has shrimp mixed in them, followed by the shrimp po boy and the angel hair pasta...I definitely recommend the angel hair pasta dish!!!\nEver thing here was fantastic!  I highly recommend trying it out, you won't be disappointed","1329":"Started with the mussels and chilie rellano and things only got better from there. I had the shrimp and grits and it was fantastic. The grits were velvety and smooth. One of the best meals I have ever had in  Tucson. Service was speedy and courteous.","1330":"Had been wanting to go here for a long time, since seeing the former Chef Kevin Sbraga win Top Chef, he was really creative and on his game. Although he's no longer there this place didn't disappoint. Very romantic, surreal environment as described. Had a fantastic waiter, informative not overbearing. Started with drinks in the bar and moved to our table. Started out our little food orgy with the Proven\u00e7al Mezze each of the items were intriguing and flavorful-eggplant caponata, hummus, olives all were stand out...quinoa ahhh jus ok but hard to outdo those other tasty starters. For our meals I ordered the Bronzino over cous cous speckled with capers, pickled currants and lemon. Fish had a super flavorful crispy skin and flaky moist meat cooked to perfection. My companion ordered the Mushroom Pot, she's a loose vegetarian and while I didn't taste her dish it looked beautiful and she seemed to enjoy it. I should say visually everything was a work of art. We did do desert splitting a strawberry rhubarb tart, came with a small scoop of delicious ice cream, we both loved it. So glad to finally get there and would recommend to anyone.","1331":"Our first visit was wonderful!  It's become our favorite restaurant. My husband had Clam Chowder and hush puppies. I had Drunken Angel pasta. For dessert, we shared the bread pudding. What a surprise! Every bite of everything we ate was absolutely fantastic.","1332":"Good food good service friendly staff cute decor-- \nWe will be back! Two thumbs up on fish n chips","1333":"Just visited the Parish for the first time for a pre-Mardi-Gras NOLA food fix...wow. Busy at 5:15 on a Saturday. Started at the bar - very competent and professional bartenders. Great beer selection - LOVED the Sleepy Dog red ale. \nMenu is not too long, not too short, and the appetizers looked like more fun than the entrees, so I had the bacon oysters (forgot the actual name) at the bar, and then had the petite NY strip salad and the smoked trout...what can I say, I can eat! Salad was a unique presentation - like a wedge, but with romaine, which required a lot of cutting (chop your own?) but the steak was divine and a nice-sized portion. The pecan smoked trout and its accompaniments were delicious. My husband had the gumbo, and he loved it; I had a taste and wasn't thrilled, but I was rather enjoying my nosh and salad. Obviously too stuffed for dessert. \nIt's LOUD in there, so not the most romantic place, but has a fun-and-funky vibe and a blend of clientele packed into a smallish space. In any case, we really liked it and will be back for more!","1334":"The grounds are beautiful. The restaurant is lovely and very fancy. The menu is obnoxiously overpriced and the execution is mediocre. The \"Shrimp Stew\" was like a tomato puree with tough overcooked shrimp. My \"Coq Au Riesling\" was a weak effort on traditional Coq Au Vin. I tasted liquid smoke in the sauce. The presentation of the food was great. Everything looked good coming out to the table. The taste and execution, not so much. It's a lovely place. If you go here, get a couple apps and a bottle of wine. For $100 a person this place falls short. If it were more reasonably priced I'd have been less discerning on the food, I don't think you get what you pay for. The popovers were really great, nice and eggie and airy. It is a nice place but I can name 100 places in Philly that have better food. Sorry.","1335":"The food and service are always excellent!  Servers are friendly and attentive.  We have dined at Parish several times and the food is always hot, tasty and well prepared.  Good selection of beer and spirits.  We enjoyed the mussels in their chorizo sauce, a cup of gumbo that has just the right amount of spice and the fish and chips with fries.  Really good fries and the fish coating was crispy and fish cooked perfectly.  The Parish Burger is one of the best I have tasted.  Lots of flavors to savor!","1336":"Amazing place. Have tried quite a few times. Never once had a bad experience. It's got everything going for it. Interior is that of a upscale bistro and the food backs it up. While be at dive bar prices. \n\nThe burgers are amazing and it's always a plus for me when a joint can make a great rare burger without leaving it completely greasy. The bloody Mary's are amazing. Owner works there just about everyday and works behind the bar and grill. Chill guy and always has time to check in on new people. \n\nLove this place we go to it every other Sunday after church. Will continue to do so.","1337":"This was one of the best meals we have eaten in the Trenton area.  Almost out of place and more reminiscent of an expensive vacation spot.  The ambience makes you feel like you are far away from home.  The service was impeccable and the waiter very knowledgeable. \n\nFor the drinkers, there are exceptional cocktails.  \n\nAll of the dishes were interesting, and in some way different from anything we had eaten before.  \n\nI would recommend it for any important event.","1338":"I absolutely love this place & the food is awesome! The pork chop is like no other I've ever seen or tasted! Bacon popcorn rocks & I just love all of their funky cool drinks!","1339":"Great flavors but smaller portions. First I had  a well-made, balanced rye Manhattan. The bartender (also my food server) was quite pleasant without being too chatty but she had just the right amount of follow-up. The blue cheese oysters I had for a starter were excellent! but it seems that 4 would have been the right serving for the price ($12). My main dish,the Drunken Angel, was superbly flavored but, again, was a bit light on the seafood and even the much less expensive pasta. Nice overall vibe. I would definitely go back.","1340":"Visited here so many times and every time is a pleasure to dine in. Food is tasteful with very good service.  Best place to lunch with family or friends. Best value for $$$..High class food for sure..","1341":"I drove 30 minutes to try this place based on the reviews and it was worth the trip!  I had the Bacon Popcorn (amazing!) and the Drunken Angel pasta.  \nI was scraping my plate clean.  I would definitely be a regular if I didn't live out of state.  Service was great, music was good.  I would absolutely recommend this place!","1342":"#1 - Beer: Sleepy Dog - nice mellow irish red ale  - on draft - which makes it even better \n#2 - Food:  Po Boy Sandwich - surprisingly good sandwich - from a meat-eater\n#3 - Service: Sat at the bar but . . . really nice service for sitting at the bar\n\nDefinitely fans.  Been on a mission to try every item on the menu.  Haven't been disappointed yet.  Comfy little bar.  Very quaint.","1343":"Our excitement to try this restaurant turned into an appalling disappointment half way through our dinner.  1) Three of six of us ordered salmon.  The peas were still frozen and so were the potatoes on my daughter's and niece's cod dish.  Our high expectations on a place with such prices led us to believe that our meals would be fresh.  2) 32 dollars for 6 small pieces of ravioli.  Again, $32 for 6 small pieces of ravioli.  3) After waiting over 30 minutes for our meal, two waiters came rushing to clear up our table 15 minutes after we started dinner.  I found this particular action rude and quite unwelcoming.","1344":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!! We love that the food is farm to table (or something like that) bc ingredients are local and seasonal! So fresh.","1345":"We have no complaints. Eveything was flawless as Nate took good care of us, checking every once in a while, but nothing was overlooked. They actually have Brooklyn IPA on draft, and a nice selection of wines. Earlier, we toured the Steward Johnson Atelier for two exciting hours, then moved over to Rats for dinner, included in the price of the tour. \nIt was a beautiful night so we sat, without a wait, outside in the covered patio, right next to the lake. We both ordered the same off the menu; miniature escargot with pastry, Scottish salmon for the entree, and Rats chocolate cake for dessert. The food was exceptional, and not as pricy as seems to be their reputation. The restaurant is beautiful everywhere we looked. We will be back.","1346":"Came here with my family for lunch, so we shared and tried a few different dishes. The food was great- and their bread and special butter mix is delicious. It wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be, though portions may run a bit small (maybe for men). I accidentally ordered something that wasn't vegetarian, and the waiter was very nice and accommodating and made a new dish for me. (They can use some more vegetarian options though ;-)). The decor and ambience is top notch! Love the way they decorated- super cute and cosy. It was winter and we sat near the fireplace which was nice. \nOne tip- go through their front door; they don't always have someone attending to the back door. \nBut overall- really good!!","1347":"Yes People Yes. Ok we had the piano room tonite for our meeting. Burgers looked amazing. Only thing is I had the fish and chips. I sent it back because I did not know it was Tilapia. I think using Cod would have been better. Our server who was super duper sweet changed it for the Pork Chop. Amazing dish. Didn't need that much sauce. The sauce was so flavorful but u really don't need too much of it. Very unique profile. So fucking good. But the best part of this meal. The front porch tea. I sucked that puppy down so quick. They need to make those available in pitchers. I would have drank one. Great job to the owners and chefs. Finally a decent cool restaurant in town who actually gets it. I can't wait. Whoever was bartending tonite was on point. This was our first visit. This is one restaurant that does deserve Michelin stars. I'm a chef and this was stellar!!!!","1348":"This place is fun and everything (EVERYTHING) is delicious! \n\nGet the bacon popcorn, the Moscow mule, fries, fish and chips, and ask about the dessert of the week. Honestly, any and all the appetizers will make your taste buds and tummy happy. Same with the drink menu. A friend swears the bread pudding is the best she has ever had. \n\nWhenever someone asks me for a food recommendation, I ask if they would be interested in bacon popcorn. When they say yes (because who wouldn't), I recommend this place. They integrate so many wonderful flavors from all over the South. \n\nThis place has so many wonderful things on the menus, you will never be disappointed. \n\nIt is located in an unsuspecting little group of other businesses on the side of Oracle. Parking can be tricky, but they have a good amount of seating indoors, at the bar, and outdoors.","1349":"This is deservedly NJ's premier restaurant experience. \n\nThe ambiance created for Rat's is difficult to rival. For the second time at the restaurant, I sat by \"Monet's lily pond and foot bridge\". Enchanting and romantic. \n\nMy onion soup broth had just the right hints of sherry and the staled french bread was topped with gruyere. The short rib melted in my mouth. Normally I drink wine but when I saw Hacker Pschorr Oktoberfest on tap, I had to pair it with the ribs.  The seasonal ice creams (maple and sweet potato) were the perfect finish to the meal. Little comps like the apple wine mole and desert chocolates never fail to put a smile on my face. \n\nApparently the transition from Kevin Sbraga to Shane Cash was seamless. \n\nThe wait staff was knowledgeable about their foods and wine, attentive, and downright friendly. They served at our requested pace. They positioned us so that we would be bathed in warmth from their outdoor heaters. They gave us a tour of the original paintings in the dining room. And we walked off our meal amongst sculptures carefully up-lighted in the gardens. \n\nThe combination of ambiance, food quality and wait staff make this restaurant one of the finest dining experiences to be had anywhere.","1350":"One of your most fave restaurants. I've been there a few times and never has it let me down. The ambiance is quite romantic in the evening, and during lunch, it's fun and festive. All the foods is excellent!  My only disappointment is the service during lunch time. I feel that they are not as pleasant and courteous as the workers in the evening. \nA few recommendations: boeuf sauce au vin blanc, duck, eggplant minion, rabbit ragout, and croque madame. I also like their french onion soup. I know its just soup, but the french onion is divine. I also like the donuts for dessert, however, their Nutella ganach taste just like Nutella out from the jar. \nGreat place to celebrate any type of celebration, especially since after your meal, you can step outside and enjoy the arts.\nI highly recommend this place.","1351":"I know Great Food and this it. The best hamburger I have ever had in this town by far.\nTheir burger isn't like anything around, the flavors they have put together should be patented.\nI took one look at another customers burger and decided not to have the fish and chips.I'm saving the fish for next time.\nPerfect portions,great flavor combinations.\nThen to top off the great prices, my absolute \/grapefruit was $3.00 during Happy Hour.\nFood and drinks  were an A+  I didn't need to talk loud so we could talk.\nVery sophisticated for a neighborhood hideaway.\nthis is a serious restaurant for adults who know food and like a stiff drink.\nGreat location for Oro Valley,and people in the North West","1352":"Good place with some different items. My favorite was the shrimp po' boy. The bacon popcorn is interesting. Many more things that I must come back to try. Love the trendy decor.","1353":"So this place used to be the Game On Sports Grille.  It was taken over by the new owners in August and will have a grand opening in December.  It is open now, it is just not necessarily complete in terms of decoration and design. \n\nI had never been to Game On, so I have no idea how it compares.  The Parish is a southern take on the gastropub.  Their \"construction\" menu is an interesting mix of Louisiana inspired cooking and traditional pub food.  There are frog legs, gumbo, fish and chips, burgers, wings.  The menu is only one page but it covers a lot of ground.  \n\nI went there last night after hearing about it through Tucson Foodie and the Tucson Citizen.  When I walked in the bar was pretty busy but I found a seat.  The staff was friendly and the service was great.  I perused the menu and ended up ordering the bacon popcorn to start.  It was excellent.  It's bacon-y, it is spiced to perfection and tastes amazing with the Abita Amber.  For my main dish I ordered the shrimp Po Boy.  When they brought it out I knew I was in trouble.  The sandwich was huge.  It is filled with crispy, yet succulent, fried shrimp.  It was amazingly tasty but my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach!  Luckily they have no problem boxing it up for you.  The fries are hand cut and fried to perfection.    \n\nThey have a relatively modest beer list (compared to Noble Hops or Union) but they do make their own liquor infusions such as, cinnamon bourbon, cucumber gin and basil vodka.   \n\nThe place has a variety of seating options, along with patio seating and an area for large groups. The interior, as it stands, has potential and will be fun and unique when it is finished.  The place was a complete surprise, especially for one that hasn't been advertised to death.  I'm definitely going again.  I love that it is close to where I work and I can easily go there to unwind after a hard day.  I went in without expectations and came out feeling satisfied and shocked that the word hadn't been spread.  Maybe it supposed to be secret...and if it is you didn't hear about it from me!","1354":"What an impressive restaurant, I came here for my graduation dinner. They were able to accommodate a fairly large party on a Friday night. The food was outstanding, try the bacon popcorn!, the drinks were unbelievably tasty, and the owners even sent over a congratulatory dessert! With all that, the prices are so reasonable. Service, drinks, and food of that caliber should have cost us so much more than it did.\n\nI really can't say enough good things about this place. It's such a positive note in the blossoming Tucson restaurant community.","1355":"We continue returning to the parrish because the staff are well trained and care about their work and the food is always wonderful.","1356":"Rat's is really an outstanding restaurant. The food was very delicious! My boyfriend loved his fillet mignon and the chicken entree I ordered was probably the best chicken I've ever had! We also really enjoyed the cheese board as an appetizer. \n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant and is perfect for special occasions. Absolutely worth the cost. Would definitely love to come back and would definitely recommend it to others.","1357":"i can't review the food because i was the recipient of a $200 gift certificate which they declined to honor because it was 2 days past expirery. 2 freakin days for $200 dollars.  that's not good business. thats short sighted and greed. so piss on rats.\n\ni have steered MANY friends away from rats. how's that for $200 ? i hope they choke on their baked brie!","1358":"Had an intimate dinner here with my husband for my birthday.  The food was really fabulous!  The bread and rolls were amazing.  They served Yorkshire Pudding popovers which melted in my mouth and smelled amazing, they almost made me cry.  I asked to buy several to take home.  Our waiter was gracious enough to give me a doggy bag with four popovers, warning me that they don't travel well.  I found that placing them in the oven to reheat maintains their flaky exterior.  For appetizers we chose the compressed octopus and Proven\u00e7al Mezze. The octopus was good but too large a quantity.  Even 1\/3 of the octopus served would've sufficed.  The Proven\u00e7al Mezze was very good but slightly overpriced for flatbread, olives and a vegetable mixture.  Our entrees included crispy grouper and suckling pig.  Both were wonderful, cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the suckling pig actually exceeded my expectations.  It was incredibly tender, served like pulled pork.  The service was professional and impeccable.  The atmosphere was amazing.  A wedding was taking  place outside which seemed magical because of the surrounding pond, weeping willows and smoky sculptures.  We will be returning in a few weeks to celebrate another special occasion.","1359":"Whoa what a unique French restaurant!!!  The French onion soup was absolutely delicious and the best I ever had. Definitely recommend it. It's s must have.","1360":"I just want to add that the weekend brunch is spectacular!!!!! As far as the service A # 1 too!!!!!\nIf I could I would eat brunch here everyday!!!!!!!","1361":"Extremely gorgeous!!! We love sitting outside, with the views of Monet's Bridge. It absolutely great to walk around Grounds for Sculptures, and then in the late afternoon to come to Rat's. The cul-de-sac where Rat's is located is simply gorgeous. It has this huge tree in the center that bends over gracefully, there were also misters on the ground which provided a welcome mist after a hot day. \n\nLocation- Did I say extremely gorgeous?!?! They have koi fish outside on the left hand side of the patio. \n\nFood- We went to the Fourth of July Lunch and I was really pleased!!! The meat cut like butter and was really yummy. The salmon was also really delish, with its golden crispy shell. The beans were deliciously sweet and I was really happy. Another time I came I ordered a hamburger which was really undercooked, but the waitress just brought me a new one. The fries are amazing!!! THIS PLACE IS NOT FRENCH THOUGH!!! \n\nService- Good in general. Just DON'T FEED THE DUCKS!!! We got yelled at for doing that. \n\nDessert- Just really really good. Even the watermelon at the July Lunch was really crisp and sweet. And the tea is really fun and brewed perfectly!\n\nI hope you end up going!!!","1362":"Sunday Brunch Buffet\n\n'Award winning' buffet was not very impressive.  Food and service were not up normal standards.  (Compared to lunch\/dinner menu)","1363":"The place was busy and full of people so expectations were high. As my friends and I waited an hour we looked of the menu. We asked for recommendations from the staff which was not all too helpful as she just listed what people have ordered. One of the suggestions was the popcorn bacon, thinking it was going to be some kind of fancy fried bacon it turned out to be just popcorn with bacon bits. It was really salty and the popcorn was slightly burnt. However, the best thing on the menu was the Drunken Angel! It was so good as soon as my friend took a bite he ordered another for the table. (We did it family style)","1364":"It's not just the great food at Rat's -- although that is terrific -- but the service and especially the ambience really make this place special. Got a table by the fireplace, a couple of excellent cocktails, and poof! amazing evening! I can only go by my one trip there last night, but I'd say this is about as good as fine dining gets. Yes, you can spend more (although Rat's is by no means inexpensive) and some restaurants will offer you food that looks like it was built by an architect, but that doesn't impress me. What impresses most at Rat's is how everyone there conspires to make sure that your evening is enjoyable and memorable. I know mine was both!\nGreat job folks!\nUndoubtedly on of the most romantic restaurants anywhere! Ask for a table by the fireplace, and be SURE to try the onion soup!","1365":"My husband and I have been to Grounds for Sculpture several times, but went to Rat's for the first time on our last visit.  What a treat!  The ambiance is breathtaking - sit outside and it's like you're part of a Monet painting come to life.  The Salmon En Croute was delicious and service was impeccable.  Not sure if I'm crazy about the name Rat's, but even that has it's charm.  It's a little expensive for lunch but considering it as part of a lovely day out makes it worth the price.","1366":"Great Sunday brunch selection, great views, beautiful place, super nice host staff. This review should have been a 5 and if not for all the things that were great, it would have been a 1 because the waitress was the worst I have ever had, and living in center city Philadelphia we eat out 3-4 times a week. This girl was rude, eye rolling, condescending. Over things like \"could you take my plate\" response, eye roll, \"I have a system....\"could we get more hot water \"eye roll...\"sure\" and it's not like we did anything, we just sat down and she started right in on us. She should not even be employed there to wash dishes. Real jerk. I am mad that I even left her a tip.","1367":"Oh, baby.  The Parish isn't as sexy as I imagined it to be.  I get that the Parish is going for a New Orleans style, but lime green walls stick out in a weird way.  And for being a gastropub, their menu emphasizes a lot of terrible domestic beers :(\n\nAlthough they were bone dry on a handful of beers that sounded good, Mr. Food for Todd and I did manage to find some tasty beers, including a delicious dark amber.  Todd also ordered The Doctor, which was really strong!  \n\nAs for food, we ordered the bacon popcorn, the steak salad, and a parish burger.  The bacon popcorn was a little heavy on the bacon grease (hahaha), but the steak and tomatoes on the salad were seasoned well and the fries were definitely memorable.\n\nCan't wait to go back and try more beers!  Mr. Food for Todd and I went alone, but they have seating in the back for groups, too!","1368":"can't help but love this place!  not only is the restaurant's d\u00e9cor enchanting, the food is pleasing to the eye and equally delicious!  we went for lunch and easily spent $100 for 2 patrons.  is that a bit much to spend on lunch?  possibly, however, if you take in the surroundings and overall ambiance it certainly amounts to a worthwhile experience.  live a little!","1369":"Had an amazing anniv dinner here last night. The setting was beautiful, drinks were delicious and food was scrumptious. Would go back in a heartbeat if it weren't so expensive.","1370":"Ate here with the family, there was a wait but the food is incredible from the shrimp and grits to all the pasta dishes.  Wonderful evening.","1371":"Came down to visit my dad for the afternoon and decided to try this place. Decided to try the shrimp and grits. Being from the south, I've had a lot and wanted to see what AZ had to offer. The place is cute, they have a series with live local talent at the moment. Only downside is that if you're sitting inside it's incredibly loud and you have to yell to hear one another. This is not a concert venue by any means. Pretty good crowd and we were seated quickly. Back to the food. Shrimp and grits came out with nice presentation, and a small cast iron skillet with collard greens. Not a big fan of greens anyway, but they were still mediocre. the shrimp were all piled on top of the grit cake. The grit cake was great, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I was not impressed with the sauce they topped the shrimp with, bland with no kick. I was disappointed at the lack of seasoning. All in all it was an ok dish but I wouldn't pay $17 for it again.","1372":"Huge disappointment and not worth what you pay.  We booked the chef's table with the promise and expectation of a personalized meal with interaction from the chef, explanation of the menu etc.  While we had a nice room adjacent to the kitchen, the chef did not introduce himself, there was no explanation of the menu or even any asks about food allergies. Besides the fact that our table had a kitchen view there was nothing different about booking the chefs table and very expensive tasting menu. The menu itself was poorly chosen with a limited variety heavy on fish and pears, and the food was mediocre lacking flavor- the cheese was horrendous (like a lump of salt) and the dessert tasted like grocery store corn bread. I had expected much more, as I have had wonderful experiences at Peacock Inn and Elements with tasting menus (not even the chefs table) that were infinitely superior and worth the expense. I also make better Cocktails at home - a very basic selection.  Bottom line - you don't get what you pay for and there are much better alternatives.","1373":"This spot is pretty great.\n\nI really love the gumbo. It's got awesome flavor and really feels like something you don't eat everyday.\n\nMy husband likes the burger a lot. It was featured in the paper recently as one of the best in Tucson so he's not alone in that.\n\nThe hushpuppies are great. The drinks are great. There is this cucumber tequila drink that tastes really refreshing. They also have a big craft beer selection.\n\nThe only things that aren't awesome are the patio just isn't that scenic, it overlooks a parking lot and Oracle and the fact that if it's really busy and you have to wait to be seated there aren't a lot of places to hang out if the bar is full.","1374":"I love the environment. \nIt has a cool bar. \n\nI love trying new things and last time I was there I tried the bacon popcorn. It was really good I think I'm going to start off every meal there for now on with bacon popcorn.  \nIt is even good for brunch! The only place I've seen that isn't afraid to put chicken and waffles with watermelon salsa. But I eat the chicken and waffles for the amazing smoked maple syrup \nIt is a staple restaurant for me and my family. Birthdays or special occasions are great but I will go for just the fish and chips.","1375":"Great space, consistently delicious food, enthusiastic staff, reasonable prices, I could go on and on.  I have been several times over the last 2 years and I can honestly say each experience was as great as the last.  Do yourself a favor, go for lunch or dinner or drinks and appetizers, you will be glad you did and you will go back again and again with friends and family who will fall in love too! Long live The Parish!","1376":"I visited last night and had a great time- sadly, I was there for the Dragoon IPA on tap and some bar snacks, not a full meal. \n\nA friend and I shared the bacon popcorn and it was like Mardi Gras in my mouth. I absolutely cannot wait to parade my way through the menu and cocktail pages, sampling some of everything. The mixologist, John, was really fun and kind- he was happy to tell us about the different soaked alcohols, marinating with spices and herbs. \n\nInteractive, delicious, and comfortable without being over the top or obvious. I am definitely a fan and will be back.  Best of all, the decor is on point and it's just fun to be a part of. Houndstooth, pink striped, and ornate gothic mixed with a polished industrial feel are basically the perfect beading to my personal tastes and eye pleasure. \n\nI'll update as I visit. \n\nJe Suis Sous Le Charme","1377":"So the best dish is the drunken angel. I had shrimp and grits yesterday and it was amazing.  My Step Dad had the Red trout. Which was amazing and the portions are big.  The trout was twice as big as I thought it would be.  Best drink in town is the Holy water.  Jalape\u00f1o infused tequila which they make in house,  agave nectar, freshly squeezed orange juice and lime, with a chili salted and sugar rim. Boom.....it blew my mind. And snack on there homemade popcorn to start.  The flavors are nothing you ever had before.","1378":"I ate here while in Tucson for work. The cornbread and hush puppies started the meal right. My coworker ordered the grits and shrimp that had the best collard greens as a side. I had the drunken angel pasta and am still having heavenly flashbacks to it. Our waiter was fun and had personality. We were treated wonderfully the whole time. The leftovers were still amazing for lunch the next day!  Making it a regular stop when I am in Tucson!","1379":"Great food and great people. Anytime we can get out of the house, The Parish is our go to for some of the best food, drinks, and music in Tucson. The Gumbo is awesome, we would go there for only that, but their appetizers are amazing, and the Po' boy is delicious. The drinks are handcrafted and out of this world. They even took special orders for my son and his bunless hotdog. Cheers.","1380":"We had a very disappointing dining experience. Whenever the Restaurant forgets to bring the entr\u00e9e the service component has got to be a zero. \nThe food, when it was served was very good. However, the service was abysmal. \nThe server started out the evening by spilling water on our legs. Then my friend got hit in the head by a serving plate. Then finally they forgot one of the entrees completely.\nThe manager came by and asked how everything was going.When I told her not well because they forgot my meal she quickly went back to the kitchen and took somebody else's dinner.","1381":"Finally made my way here for dinner.\n\nIt was smaller on the inside than I had anticipated but that isn't a big deal.  We were seated right away and our server was very friendly.\n\nWe started with the goat cheese relleno, and my friend ordered the fish and chips and I got the pulled pork sandwich.  I was warned that the pulled pork was spicy but I was okay with it.  The goat cheese relleno was pretty good, but the balsamic reduction was too reduced and had stuck to the plate.  I was hoping to have been able to swipe my fork through more of it, but it wouldn't budge much on the plate.  But it did look  pretty.  The fish and chips had good and bad points.  Good point - the fish and batter was extra crispy and had good flavor.   Bad point - The chips, not so much.  They were good fries but not the \"chips\" you expect with fish and chips.  Actually they were the same exact fries that came with my pulled pork sandwich.  Speaking of, my sandwich was sooo good.  It was super spicy but the coleslaw and cilantro in the coleslaw were a perfect compliment.  The flavor was very good.  But it is super spicy.  You have been warned.\n\nOverall, good food and it is different from every other place.  I will probably be trying the gumbo and hush puppies on the next visit, which means I will be back.","1382":"The ambiance is incredible! Beautiful, romantic gardens and the interior of the restaurant is charming French Country. \n\nThe food is out of this world. I am so sick and tired going to these restaurants that try to be eclectic and they always miss the mark somehow. This place is on point :)\n\nEnjoy!","1383":"Hamilton's best kept secret. Nestled inside the Grounds for Sculpture. The irony is Rat's is literally just seconds away from the hood, but when you walk inside this establishment you are greeted with the utmost hospitality and the food is an exquisite fare of cuisines.","1384":"Food, service & atmosphere were amazing. We shared an Appetizer which was grilled oysters. Delicious buttery sauce. Trout entree (& the baby book choy) was flavorful & cooked to perfection. Seafood salad was fresh & had plenty of seafood (shrimp & crab) & plenty of avocado. Dessert was ice cream trio (creamsicle \/ brown butter \/ chocolate basil) & creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (lemon thyme flavor was amazing). Jeana was our server who was friendly, funny & provided excellent service. \nThe atmosphere was charming.  We sat outside & overlooked the pond filled with Lilly pads, flowers, ducks  & a few sculptures. \nI am already planning my next visit. \nAfter lunch we walked around the grounds. \nOverall an enjoyable day!","1385":"Overall a good meal at Rat's.  Presenting mostly French bistro-type fare, our party of four enjoyed several selections from the menu.  The French onion soup is a must buy; it is one of the better interpretations of this mouth-watering and intimacy-killing appetizer.  I also enjoyed the duck breast, and the medley of vegetables that accompany each entree is flavorful.  Service was good, but parking was tight because of the snow.  Also, Google maps will take you right to the UPS distribution hub just down the road, which is probably not the best option for dining, unless you bring your own everything.","1386":"Amazing food and gluten friendly too. Go there with friends so that you can pig out on all the yummy appetizers. This is the first time that I had southern food and I am highly impressed by it.","1387":"Rats has always been a favorite place of mine, and I am a GFS member. Recently I was diagnosed with celiac disease so I have to now eat Gluten Free. I have been to Rats several times since and have found them very un-accommodating about gluten free restrictions. I was at brunch today, and in the few times I asked a question about whether a food item was gluten free, someone would have to go back to the kitchen to ask. Rather than being nice and accommodating about it, the server acted like this was a huge inconvenience. Rather than giving attitude, I would much rather see the staff be friendly and knowledgeable, and even better would be to be pro-active (like when you bring the plate of desserts, anticipate that I will ask the question and already have the answer before the plate is brought out. Even better would be to offer me an alternative dessert since there was nothing on the plate that is not GF). Rats is a lovely setting, but they need to improve the service and  get with the times. Most better restaurants I know and go to are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions, and the best wait staff makes it an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately that hasn't been my recent experience with Rats, and it wasn't today either.","1388":"Rat's is named not after the rodent, but rather after a character, Ratty, in a Kenneth Grahame novel -- a courageous if offputting choice. The restaurant's setting overlooking a lovely lake at the Grounds for Sculpture is as satisfying as we've experienced in decades of world travel -- a nigh perfect spring midday with ducks waddling around the table only served to heighten the experience. If weather's appropriate, definitely go for an outdoor table.\n\nFor lunch, we started with superb baguette slices and butter that put nearly all French (and American) bakeries and creameries to shame. For apps, we had charcuterie and salmon tartine, both quite pleasant but the tartine gets the nod. Perhaps a one-up issue, but with both apps the accompanying toast was burnt, detracting from taste -- a Starr restaurant that can't toast bread properly?\n\nFor mains we had a creatively prepared pastrami sandwich, excellent, and pea-and-wild-mushroom risotto that was enjoyable even if not quite equal to the very best we've had. Clafoutis dessert with ice cream was pleasant, but a letdown as compared to traditional versions I've enjoyed at family meals and restaurants in France.\n\nWine and beer choices mate nicely with lunch offerings. Nevertheless, my wife chose instead to have a Jewel of Russia martini that was not only delicious, but melded nicely with her lunch.\n\nService was flawless. In all, five rock-solid stars for ambience, five for service, five for drinks and four for (lunchtime) food.\n\nWe followed this with a two-hour sculpture tour around the Grounds. By the time it all ended, by wife was beaming with delight -- and I didn't even have to buy her a new Porsche. Cheaper, too.","1389":"Great food and great service. Our waitress (Alyssa) was awesome! The ambiance was really nice. We ate here because we were at the sculpture garden and decided to give this place a try and it was totally worth it. Only thing I would recommend is to add more items to the menu.","1390":"This was my second time visiting and I was afraid that it wouldn't measure up to the first impression. Boy was I wrong! At first we were seated in the middle of the outdoor seating and not close to the koi pond. We requested from the waiter to have us moved but he said the tables by the koi pond were reserved for happy hour but we explained that we were there celebrating an anniversary and the manager came out and personally had us moved by the pond. That made all the difference for me. I was instantly on vacation. All I could see was the water and the fish and the fog and lily pads. We were given many compliments of the chef tasting plates in addition to our orders. We ordered the salmon and creme fraiche appetizer which was absolutely decadent. Their herb butter was just perfect with the rolls. I ordered the red snapper which was delicious. So many different layers to taste. We had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cappuccino to end our dinner and prepare us to tour the grounds. Again this was my second time at the restaurant and the grounds but this time we took a left turn and discovered a whole new area that I hadn't seen before. This is a hidden gem of a place that's worth visiting often. A short 30 min drive for me but a great place to spend a few hours of peace and tranquility. The perfect escape from the daily routine.","1391":"A nice surprise. When walking in I was thinking another bar!  Looked at the menu and realized this probably not another bar. I started talking to some other customers and asked them what they ordered. They said the Parish Burger. So we ordered thenParish Burger and the gumbo. What a pleasant surprise. The gumbo was wonderful. Nice smokey flavor. Regular order comes with chicken and andouille sausage. For $5-$6 you can order more add one such as shrimp.  I have ordered gumbo a few times at some different places over the last several months and is with great joy that I have finally found a good one. The Burger comes with (too many) French  fries and a wonderful burger. The beef is prepared nicely. The other special add ones include a special relish etc. just try it!  Very good. A nice stop with a small Year varied menu to satisfy all your tastes.","1392":"If I lived in Tucson I'd be here every weekend, and that is saying A LOT because I rarely go back to the same place twice. Being a New Orleans native, I am usually skeptical when a restaurant has a NOLA theme. I can honestly say I felt like I was sitting at a bar on Frenchman and not in a restaurant in a strip mall. The atmosphere, the music, the vibe, wrap you up in a humid blanket of New Orleans good feeling. The food was excellent. We had bacon popcorn. Not popcorn dusted with bacon flavored salt, but pot popped popcorn tossed in bacon fat and little pieces of real bacon.  The drink menu is creative and perfect for the summer Tucson climate. They also house infuse a lot of their liquors. Another noteworthy menu item is the charred onion dip. Oh geeze! If I'd have known how good it was before I ordered it, I would have had it spread on my po boy! I've never tasted anything like it. One of the owners (the one from Baton Rouge) was walking around, talking to guests, and bringing out food. I love it when the owners are willing participants in their business and the customer experience. I don't wish I lived in Tucson or down in \"Da Parish\" (if you're a NOLA native you'll get the reference)  but I wish I lived closer to the Parish.","1393":"The perfect stop on our way from AZ Sonoran Desert Museum to Loews! Everything was great, from bacon popcorn to the crawfish hush puppies to the (both) pork sandwiches to the red trout to the beer. And the service was spectacular! Added bonus: Sit outside for a view of the mountains. For an unassuming joint in a strip mall, this would definitely be a place I'd frequent if I lived in Tucson.","1394":"Great food, comfortable atmosphere, attentive service.. 4th trip back, would highly recommend taking your out of town guests here.","1395":"A++. Delicious food, wonderful service,  manager came and talked to us. We ordered fish and chips,  the Parish burger and BBQ pork sandwich.  The pork is super smokey but my family liked it. I like the atmosphere with the cool artwork and fun interior paint. I will definitely be back for Tuesday jazz night. I almost forgot to mention the Bacon popcorn,  definitely worth the  calorie splurge.","1396":"Absolutely beautiful, but the food left a lot to be desired. Very pedestrian French onion soup and I did NOT like the seafood salad. The bread and herbed butter was awesome, though. Our server, Rachel, was very good and adorable, though the kitchen was pretty slow so we were left hanging for a while ( not her fault). I might give them another try, but next time I visit GfS, I'll probably just try the one of the low key cafes.","1397":"Came for lunch and I would recommend a reservation and ask for a waterfront table (weather permitting) it's beautiful there unless you are afraid of ducks! They will come visit you!. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. We had a couple of drinks and a cheese plate to start. Both very good as well as a bread basket with herb butter. Wife order the Ruben that came with homemade slaw and I got the Wild boar ragu! Again both were delicious! The view and decor are worth the trip if you like old school artsy type places. Lunch with cocktails and tip was $80 well worth it. Also visit Grounds for Sculpture it's very nice(buy tix online as they hardly take walk ins)","1398":"Amazing food and nice live music! Would definitely go again. I love their alcohol selection as well, they make a lot of their own which I think is neat","1399":"We really enjoyed this place. We went for lunch a few weeks ago. For starters they have great Bloody Mary 's.. I had the strawberry infused balsamic pur\u00e9e Bloody Mary. For apply, we had the hummus , couscous plater and the smoked salmon. My lunch,,, the rabbit ragout over bucatini pasta! Wow.. Loved this dish. The space is very nice and the grounds around the restaurant are excellent. I would certainly return, great place for a family brunch\/lunch.","1400":"Rats is in an interesting location that transfers you immediately from \"industrial Highway\" to oasis with beautiful gardens and interesting sculptures.  The food was decent.  If you are a foodie and dine in NYC, this may fall a little flat for a $300 spend.  The menu has some safe selections like scallops and filet mignon.  It's most interesting dish seemed to be the lamb sampler.  The chef uses in season, fresh, local organic veggies with most entrees.  The wine list is extensive but a bit overpriced for Hamilton and for the vintages\/wines offered.  There was one 2005 Bordeaux and it was $380 - no thanks.     The service was 5 stars.  Very attentive yet conversational and down to earth. \n\nSo, all in all, it was o.k. but not up to par as compared to similar restaurants that portray themselves similarly.  I would stash away the $300 (if you get a half decent bottle of wine) and perhaps go to NYC to Modern or Le Cirque if you are up for something different and artsy with exquisite food.  The are likely a few better picks in New Brunswick if you don't feel like hitting the city.  I don't think we'll be back for dinner unless we need something close by or invited to hang out with friends.","1401":"Excellent dining experience   We joined friends we had not seen in a long time. After a quick ramble through the Grounds for Sculpture we returned to be seated for dinner. We were greeted warmly and promptly seated upstairs at a corner table with pedestrian views. The quiet disappeared quickly when a large and loud party sat down nearby. Despite that we continued to enjoy conversation with Pat & Ivan.  \nOur waiter was very well versed in the menu and took the time to help us navigate through it.  The menu included items from across the globe supplemented by supplies provided by local farmers.\nAfter ordering drinks, we made our choices. I enjoyed the wonderful Escolar pesce special after sharing a non exciting lobster crepe with my wife. She enjoyed the halibut special while our friends sampled the scallops and salmon entrees. Portion sizes were perfect. We had woofed down several slices of the wonderful French bread before dinner so we were fully sated.\n\nOverall we agreed the food was excellent, drinks were enjoyed and coffees and desserts were a nice way to finish up the evening. The ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful. Prices were on the high end but worth it. We all concluded we will be back..","1402":"Wow, just wow.  Rat's is amazing and absolutely my favorite restaurant in Mercer County.  The sculpture grounds are exceptionally impressive and form a terrific backdrop for an amazing meal.  I've eaten lunch here 3 times in the last 2 months and, the service and food has been consistently good.\n\nI really like the smoked salmon rillette and warm shrimp salad but none of my colleagues or I  have ever had a bad meal here.  If you live in Mercer County or are visiting, make a point to go to Rat's and leave enough time to check out the sculpture grounds.","1403":"Great little spot! Highly recommend the gumbo and hush puppies! The smoked salmon salad was really well done, too- lots of flavors and textures. My husband was impressed by the beer list. Our service was prompt and friendly. Great little spot!","1404":"This is a great little place that is located right in the Grounds for Sculpture. Based on where you sit, it's a very cool environment. I've sat in the downstairs dining area(meh), upstairs ( a bit formal), and in the tables in the bar area (yay!). The bar\/lounge area is, by far, the best place to sit for a drink and eat. It isn't as formal as the other areas of the restaurant but it always has a really cool vibe. Their menu is pretty small but I've never been disappointed. \n\nAs far as service, I've had great service and so-so service. Bar service is typically okay but I've been there a couple of times where they were not busy, yet did not really care about serving customers at bar. I'm not sure what's going on with that. \n\nOverall, it's a pretty nice place to go for a fancyish dinner. Be sure to check their schedule as they sometimes have limited hours and\/or are closed for vacation.","1405":"A win! Love to see some great dining options popping up in the Northern Tucson\/Oro Valley area. Went for my dads birthday earlier this week (kind of bummed our server made no acknowledgement...its such a bummer that restaurants aren't doing this anymore), and enjoyed a fun meal with great drinks. Awesome beer list, loved that they had the Del Bac whiskey I have been hoping to try, and everything we ordered was great. The bacon popcorn was a big hit, as were the pork rinds with my husband and dad. Split the fish and chips, which was a great portion with very tasty fish. My daughters hot dog was amazing and so much food for a kids menu...we had to help her out a bit. Gumbo was delicious, and my dads pork chop was incredible. Don't come here expecting to count calories..its a \"splurge\" type restaurant for sure, but you will enjoy the experience enough to not care.","1406":"I'm diggin' it. I like stopping by The Parish when I find myself on the NW side of Tucson. In true gastropub style the drinks are unique and delicious the food, although not the best I've ever had, is good and the service follows suit.","1407":"I had high hopes, but the food was just OK. We came on a busy Sunday and were told that the place was fully booked despite many empty tables.  We were offered seats at the bar and it worked out fine.  They have a cool outdoor area overlooking the Monet Bridge and a few sculptures (from Grounds for Sculpture).  It's a French restaurant, but the bar is decorated with a Moroccan theme.  \n\nI ordered a pickled peach tart to start - it looked good, but was stale \/ bit dense.  A knife and fork did not cut it easily so I ate it with my hands.  No biggie!  I figured the Croque Madame would make up for it, but the bread was stale again and the sauce mornay was blah.  Overall, nice setting, nice plating, but average food.","1408":"I'm a very picky eater so the first time my fianc\u00e9 took me to this place I was very timid and went in with the expectation that I wouldn't be able to find anything to eat. Now let me tell you.. as a lover of pulled pork.. their pulled pork sandwich is amazing. I don't know what they put in that sauce but it's heaven on earth. With just the right amount of sweetness and a kick of something spicy, it's sure to satisfy you any day. Oh and the bun is also great. \n\nTheir bacon popcorn and pork rinds are also so delicious!! Every time we come here for drinks we get one or the other as a bar snack and they've never disappointed. Also, if you love tequila I'd recommend getting their \"La Verdad\" mixed drink. It's the best thing on the drinks menu! And the price isn't too bad if you're not there during happy hour either. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is beautiful. With different colored walls with local artwork adorning them.. I constantly find myself looking around while I'm eating. There's just so much that catches the eye. I also love that this place has local artists play too! Expect a long wait when there's a band playing though. So maybe don't go hungry because by the time a table opens up you definitely will be. \n\nThe only thing I haven't enjoyed at this restaurant would be their bread pudding dessert. But then again I've never liked bread pudding so maybe a not so picky person would enjoy it.","1409":"Very disappointing menu choices and quality.  Definitely did not live up to all the hype.  I would not return.  Perhaps the people who love it have never had any other french country cuisine.","1410":"My friend and I went to Grounds for Sculpture and Rats (name of restaurant). We have been there before but never for dinner. The Sculpture grounds were amazing at night , a completely different viewpoint the way the sculptures were lit up, spectacular.The food at Rats was excellent, the room we dined in was charming. Our waiter, however was very brusque. Never smiled and he just wanted to hurry us on...tick tock tick tock...come on I've got two more sittings to get through (thats what it seemed like to us) and he bordered on being rude. I joked to my friend 'I don't think he likes his job'. Here's the amusing coincidence. Later after dinner I was standing in a hallway waiting for my friend, around the corner from the service area I here a tray being set down quite loudly and I hear \"Oh I love my job\" said EXTREEMLY sarcastically. I looked around the corner and there was Benjamin our waiter.I hope someday Benjamin realizes how much a wait person can add to a diners experience, because right now I do not wish to go back to Rats. If I do I know I won't be served by Benjamin.","1411":"We had dinner at Rat's last night for our daughter's 16th birthday (her choice of restaurants). First of all, we had an AMAZING time. We've been to Rat's several times over the years, but the service we received last night really made it even better. Our server, Jeff, was outstanding. If anyone goes there, please ask for him. He was very patient with us (we ask a lot of questions) and described the appetizers, meals and desserts perfectly. It is definitely worth getting there at least an hour or so early so that you have plenty of time to walk through the Grounds for Sculpture (we only had about 20 minutes, and wished we had more time). From the  moment we arrived walking through the man-made mist that set the ambiance (very magical!), to the decor of the restaurant, to the lovely grounds, to the interesting menu...the experience was terrific. Wonderful!","1412":"I hate leaving a negative review for this restaurant because there are some WONDERFUL things about it. The food is good and the space is beautiful. However, be forewarned to never host an event here. For the price that is paid (hosting a wedding or shower is costly), the venue is extremely cheap with what they offer. Not only were we overcharged for our event, but the coordinators even misrepresented prices (for example: telling us that the price of a lemonade was $2.50 and writing that in our event contract, but then charging us $6 per glass-- I've never spent over $150 on lemonade before). And some of the costs are completely ridiculous. For a shower that was hosted, the cost was $50\/pp plus 18% gratuity + tax + 5% administrative fee. Can you guess what was charged for a 3-year-old's plate of buttered noodles? $27 + fees. That is ridiculous. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VENUE FOR ANY TYPE OF PARTY. YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF.","1413":"Fabulous time at the Parish last night.  Food was excellent - had the Drunken Angel pasta and hubby had the pork chop.  Both entrees were very delicious.  What shined were the cocktails and the excellent service from our bartender, Nathan.  I'm a vodka girl and my husband likes bourbon.  He created delicious drinks that suited us perfectly. Great attention to detail and pride in crafting excellent cocktails.","1414":"We love the Parish!  We live in Phoenix and come down for the Tucson marathon and found this place years ago and it has become part of our annual trip. the food is outstanding and never disappoints. My \ngo to favorite is the drunken angel pasta and I try the ribs and Dr Pepper last time it was all fantastic.","1415":"The food is phenomenal. The service is great. Lunch is a great time with Teresa behind the bar. Stop by on your break from work or after for a great time. Try the crawfish hush puppies and the war pig.","1416":"Had a great graduation dinner celebration- ordered many dishes to share...oysters on the half shell, frog legs, shrimp & grits, drunken angel, salmon salad, Johnny steak and fries.  We also had many of their unique cocktails with infused liquors.  Sat outside in December and there were many heaters so was not cold at all.","1417":"Went for a holiday meal with the family. Good food, attentive staff, good experience.","1418":"My wife and I love this restaurant. We got engaged and married at Rat's and it will always be our place for special occasions. A few months ago we were in to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and had an unfortunate experience that made us walk out without eating. Our server was rushing us to order and it was really just off putting. We spoke to the hostess who begged us to stay and said she would set us up with another server. She went to set everything up and when she returned she changed her tune and seemed like she was trying to talk us into just leaving. Is was an unpleasant thing and we thought maybe we were done with our favorite restaurant. I decided to call and speak to a manager just to relay our disappointment. I spoke to Cheryl and she was very nice and apologetic. About a week later we received a hand written letter along with a $75 gift card. We were very surprised and happy. We made reservations for my birthday and when we went to find our gift card, we could not figure out where we had put it. We went to the restaurant anyway and explained to Cheryl what had happened in hopes that they had some kind of tracking system for the cards. They could not track it, but she offered us the $75 discount despite us not having the gift card. Incredible customer service. We were not expecting that at all. Our meal was on point, as usual. We had some great bar snacks durimg happy hour before being seated. The olive escabeche and fried artichokes were awesome! We also had a french cheese steak and a fish taco, both really good. The French onion soup so thick with deeply caramelized onions and beautifully browned cheese on top was the star of the evening. The cheese plate was great too. My pork chop was a tiny bit overcooked for my liking, but not dry. I would have liked it closer to medium than well done, but I didn't specify that before ordering so it didn't bother me. It was still delicious as was my wife's Riesling chicken. Our server Peter was so great. It's really hard to get great service anymore and he was amazing. Very attentive and super nice. We liked him very much. All in all it was a five star evening and we will be back for every birthday and anniversary.  Thank you Cheryl, Peter and all of the front and back of the house people who work so hard to make Rat's the fantastic place it is.","1419":"This place has been on my list of potential spots to check out in town for a long time, and recently I had the opportunity to go w\/a friend. The food was very tasty--the drunken pasta was really delicious w\/the crawfish in particular. I haven't had that quality of cajun food outside of NOLA that I can remember, which is definitely a testament to this restaurant. \n\nThe thing that is such a bummer is the waiter who we had that night. One of my pet peeves is treating oneself to a meal that may be on the true enough \"treat yoself\" scale and it ending up in flames because of poor customer service. My friend and I both had dietary restrictions that needed to be accommodated and the server made an insensitive remark regarding that. I don't think he had any malicious intent, but it really put a damper on the experience. Especially when a restaurant is a bit pricier and you're supposed to be paying for the overall experience--service and food included. I followed up with the manager to let them know that for such a price point, servers really need to be more in the loop w\/this stuff. \n\nThis definitely isn't the first place I've been to when the price and service don't match up. Again, the food itself was really on point but unfortunately missed the mark service-wise. With lots of other eateries that may have better service, it's something to consider.","1420":"We go here every year for our company's holiday party & other special occasions. I am sure the did here is fine, but for vegetarians beware. The risotto was so bad that it felt like I was chewing rubber. I are until my jaw started hurting.\n\nI understand that you have to serve a large part all together, but how can you premake risotto & serve it hours later? And this has happened many times over. Like I said, we go here every year at least once","1421":"So upsetting that after making this reservation we were seated in the bar! The restaurant claimed that since I made this reservation via OpenTable they did not seat us in one of the formal dining rooms. We were dressed in formal wear, as requested, but were forced to sit in the bar surrounded by people in shorts & casual attire. We looked out of place for dressing so formal! Additionally we had people coming in & out of the terrace bumping into our table, walking to the bar. A really horrible experience. And when we talked to management they did nothing to help or change our table since we booked the table of OpenTable. Food was good but nothing amazing. My mom's 65th birthday dinner was ruined since she didn't get to eat in the dining room. What was the point of even making a reservation if we were seated in the bar? Will never return. And after complaining I expected an apology or something of our meal to be comped. Absolutely nothing was offered or comped of our bill.","1422":"Drop in for good food and great drinks!!!!!!\n\nTheir menu is very southern\/Creole\/Louisiana swamp meets Sonora style eatin'. I tried their frog legs which were succulently wrapped in bacon and cooked to perfection. The bacon and scallion popcorn was an addicting starter! We had a burger which was juicy and tasteful, and the pulled pork sandwich which was OUTRAGEOUSLY Hot!!!!!! It was a jerk spiced concoction that was marinated in a habanero mix. I love spicy food and use \"ghost chili\" and habanero on regular occasion, but this sandwich gave me all that I could handle!!! It took me some time and alot of iced tea refills to finish it!\n\nTheir bar is stocked with some of the best micro brews (Abita - Louisiana) and Belgian favorites, but their mix drinks are far and above the stars of the show! Their head bartender has an arsenal of infused libations at his disposal with which he produces some of the greatest cocktails in the West! Try his muddled Aztec chocolate Old Fashioned!!\n\nSee and drink for yourself!","1423":"Oh man, what a find! \n\nAlmost makes me sad that I am not around anymore to enjoy this wonderful place as often as I would like...\n\nJohn the bartender...er...MIXOLOGIST which is actually much more of an appropriate term...is an absolute genius when it comes to delectable drink combinations.  He mixes, marinates and concocts his very own syrups and mixers for which they uses for all of the completely original cocktails on the well thought our bar menu.  How f-ing cool is that?!?!  I already LOVE this place!!!\n\nSo...after falling in love with the bar...THEN I was exposed to the even more intricate and enticing menu.  I can't really even say enough about how much fun the menu is; you really just have to go try it for yourself.  Some of the items I tried were:\n\n1) Steak and frites - Heavy, HEAVY but dear God it was sooo f-ing worth it!!! \n2) Bacon wrapped frog legs - Very interesting, the bacon drowns out the delicate frog flavor but it's a really fun dish.  :)\n3) I'm so sorry, I actually forgot what I ordered because I couldn't stop eating the steak & frites!  I will update as soon as I remember...\n\nThe parking was a breeze.  The decor was whimsical, modern and bright but also romantic and hole-in-the-wall friendly - the owner was actaully walking around and talking with clients, very cool!","1424":"Came here for New year's eve. Special menu. The short rib ravioli was spectacular and we wish it were a permanent item on the menu. The gumbo was excellent, but not as distinctive. Service was on point too.","1425":"Came here several times and it's a hit or miss depending on the season.  They change their menu seasonly.  Some seasons it's better then others.  Love the decor and service.  Sitting outside the view is beautiful.  Very tranquil.","1426":"My wife and I always go there for our dates. We love going there for their excellent foods, atmosphere, services. After lunch, we would go to the Sculpture grounds and linger there for hours, taking pictures and enjoying the good weather! Its a very romantic getaway for your loved one!","1427":"Party of 6 and everyone absolutely loved this place.  We had quail, steak, shrimp and grits, tons of appetizers and everything was superb.  We were soooo full when we left, but very happy and satisfied.  They have a nice wine list and lots of very cool and tasty infused cocktails.  The restaurant is well done and the service is excellent.  From the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave everyone is very service oriented and pleasant.","1428":"Love this place!  The staff is really professional and nice, and the food is always outstanding.  Everything I've eaten there has been excellent, authentic Cajun, of the highest quality.  I withhold the 5th star only because they don't serve Heineken.","1429":"The Parish Burger was nothing but DEELISH!!!! We dish a a garden type salad that was ok but I won't bag on it because that was my wife's pick. I wanted the salmon salad. Oh well. The have expanded here and the atmosphere is got a shabby sheik look that I totally dig. I have been here when the live music is going and they have some local faves that blend in well with the look and food. Dragoon IPA is also worth trying. I was gonna go four stars but what the hell, five it is!!! Don't take my word for it, I encourage anyone to check it out.","1430":"We have been coming here for 17 years! We arrived early for our brunch and had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and being served by Shawn. She was so pleasant and accommodating that we felt like honored guests in her home. Thank You So Much! For the outstanding service and professional demeanor. We will definitely be back! Especially for the killer martini's! Blue cheese olives #Killer","1431":"We enjoyed our meal here very much and will return. Service was excellent.  Our table was ready in a timely manner.  Our food was really yummy and portions ample, I could not finish mine.  There was a great jazz trio playing to round out the evening.","1432":"Tucson, I salute you!  In my never ending quest to find a gumbo (almost) as good as what I can make at home, I have FINALLY FOUND IT.  \n\nToo bad it's 100 miles south from me.  Sad face.\n\nSeriously, folks, go here, get the gumbo, think of me.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nHusband had a burger he said was good but messy.  I don't recall what it was, the waitress recommended it. \n\nVery nice friendly staff, we just stopped in for lunch on a yelp recommendation on a road trip and our waitress was happy to help us out with letting us know her favourite things.","1433":"On Saturday April 29th. 2017 my husband and I set out for a nice day at the \"Grounds For Sculpture\" only to be HIGHLY dissappointed with the \"Rats\" restaurant. We went for an early dinner at 4:15 and we were told they were presently closed and will reopen at 5:00. We asked if we needed to make a reservation and we were told they weren't taking reservations, but we can be seated when we came back at 5pm.  Upon our arrival at 4:59, we were told we could not be seated because they were completely booked.\nMy question is: how can the restaurant be completely booked if they did not take reservations and they did not open til 5pm. Who were they seating that booked all of their tables? News Flash. We walked past open tables when we returned to be seated. With this information, my husband demanded to speak with the manager on duty. She informed us that the restaurant was in fact booked. My husband wanted to know (LOUDLY) why we were told to come back at 5pm if they weren't planning on seating us.\nThe manager asked my husband to speak quietly and she would try to see what she could do to seat us. Upon her return, she miraculously found a table to seat us in a completely booked restaurant. We were not happy to be seated at the exit door table and we spent too much time waiting for any kind of service. You would think the manager would have made sure we were taken care of since Rats handled the situation poorly. We were going to be \"Paying\" customers until we got fed up with the wait and left.  I told my husband I believed that we were seated at the exit door table and service was held up intentionally so that we would leave. \nRats needs new management. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who walks The Grounds for Sculpture. \nDo yourself a favor and save your money on this over priced menu and find a better place outside.","1434":"From out of town and I highly recommend coming here! Amazing food, the best fish and chips I've ever had. Homemade tarter sauce is to die for. Good service and a really cool atmosphere.","1435":"We were SO disappointed last night for dinner at Rats. We used to dine here 5 or so years ago and the food was high quality and delicious. Well that has all changed now. The food was absolute GARBAGE. \nThe service was nice, the restaurant is lovely to look at and The Grounds for Sculpture is always nice, but the price when up from $12 a person last year to $15 this year. I wanted a glass of wine to walk around the grounds with. The bartender filled my glass, like what I thought was a normal glass, but instead of $8 for a glass of Rose', she charged me $16! She said it was a 'Double'. I will go back for the Sculpture Garden, but never again will I give my money for such low quality food. It's too bad because we really were looking at this place for our wedding, but now that we tried the food again, I would be embarrassed to have my wedding here.\nI am so surprised at all the 5 star ratings from so many customers. They must not know good quality food, because Rats certainly isn't.","1436":"Great restaurant. Staff was wonderful especially Mike and Billy. Food was fantastic and interesting.","1437":"Our first time here, couldn't wait to try it out.  A party of 4 (one was a first timer who had never had cajun). We had the Gumbo and the Shrimp & Grits the Red Trout and the Parish Burger....all were fantastic!!! The food presentation was superb and the flavor was very authentic!!  The \"bawled\" peanuts were just like I remember.  Haven't had good Cajun since I moved from the south....until today!  We will definitely come back again!  :)","1438":"Beautiful views, food just isn't up to par. We went for my birthday and I had polenta with mushrooms and blueberry gastrique. It was ok, really nothing special. Hubby had trout with baby bok choy, very average. We told them it was my birthday but they didn't sing or anything. At least I got a nice picture with a pretty backdrop. I've lived in Mercer for over 11 years and have never been, I wasn't missing anything for sure.","1439":"Attended happy hour sing-along. Half-price specials on selected drinks and appetizers - everything well-made. Waiter had an attitude - not allowing our trio to split bill but combining unrelated couple's who joined our table. When we pointed it out, he retook couple's order but the revised bill was still wrong.","1440":"Very cute place that I'm dragging every friend that comes from out of town to. Excellent Brunch options and delicious burgers! For my vegetarian friends, try The Big Hippie Burger! So good.","1441":"This place is just beautiful. The ambiance is lovely, the food is absolutely delicious and the service is spot on. This is a wonderful place to go for a special occasion, as it feels very intimate and romantic. Happy Hour is also really nice, with delicious discount drinks and yummy poutine fries. We had the salmon and the carmelized scallops for dinner, which were both cooked to perfection. Also try the melon mojito! I could not find anything to critique about this restaurant. It's also nice to be able to wander around the Grounds for Sculpture after dinner.","1442":"My friend invited me to eat here in Rat's Restaurant. The first thing that came to mind was ratatouille. Hahaha. Maybe because of the name? As we entered the place, the waiter greeted me then we were seated right away. They were friendly and helpful. The food has a balanced flavor. I love how the food was well cooked. The wine selections were also good. The interior decors was awesome! It's very stylish, cozy, and classy. If you're looking for a place that can make you feel satisfied at the same time with a full tummy, this is the restaurant for you.","1443":"I'm not a Kevin Sbraga groupie, I swear.  Buuutttt.....I might be now.\n\nI'll admit, I only know of the restaurant because of him.  Before that, I've never even heard of Grounds for Sculpture or Rats.  My knowledge of Trenton did not extend pass the train station.  Drive through Trenton, I was convinced that I had the wrong address.  But after a few right turns and a giant rat in a suit statue, I was on the grounds.  \n\nMy dinner buddy and I were given both the restaurant week menu and the main one.  Of course, coming all this way, we decided to go all out and order off the regular menu.  Our meal was as follows:\n\nApp: \nFoie Gras - amazing\nEscargot- amazing - er\n\nEntree:\nBlack bass - amazing\nLamb- amazing-er\n\nDessert:\nBrownie Sundae - great\n\nSo yes, the brownie sundae was the low point of the meal.  But in a \"dumbest kid in the gifted class\" kind of way.  It's still a class of geniuses.  \n\nI hope this place remains just as good after Kevin's departure.","1444":"So noisy that conversation was completely impossible. Food was good although hushpuppies appetizer was on the edge of over-browned, but I literally had a headache from the noise by the time we left. Not my thing at all.","1445":"In my opinion, The Parish is the best restaurant in town. The food is always outstanding! Some of my favorites are the pasta dishes, fish and chips, shrimp and grits, pork sandwich, burger. The appetizer crawfish hush puppies are amazing. The service is always good and it has a very nice atmosphere.","1446":"I love gastropubs, and this place tops the charts. I was in Tucson for work, and the Yelp reviews landed me here. Thank you, fellow Yelpers. Once again, you have not let me down.\n\nMy boyfriend and I showed up pretty late. When we arrived, the bartender instructed us to seat ourselves. It was pretty busy for a late weeknight, most guests were having drinks. We started with frog legs. This is the only time I've tried them. They are wrapped in bacon, and they are the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. I'm 100% positive that I've never enjoyed any food or drink more than the bacon wrapped frog legs at The Parish. I ordered trout as my meal, and unfortunately it could not follow the frog legs. I forgot to mention this place has a southern flair; I loved the trout, but I've never liked dirty rice or collard greens. This is no fault of The Parish...be cautious if you're like me and can't appreciate all southern fare.\n\nThe bartender ended up as our server and he was awesome. He handled the entire restaurant\/bar well. If you like cocktails, this seems like a good place to drink. I highly recommend eating here, too. Tucson really surprised me with this place. Bravo.","1447":"I wish I could give 0. Racial discrimination maybe?  Our family (all Asian) went there and the host said \"if you dont have reservations, there is only bar stool left.\" This was not true... I saw many tables empty so I asked again nicely that I am willing to wait until there is any seat coming available. And they kinda refused and kept said there will be no seat available for \"all day.\" At this point I noticed the host did not want me to eat there.. I had to leave. On my way out of the park, I ran into one family waiting for the table to be available. I am not coming back to this place ever....","1448":"The Parish is a good restaurant, but the limited menu is what keeps us from coming back.  How often can you eat gumbo, fish and chips, the drunken angel, or burgers?  The chef at the Parish is consistently at the top of the Tucson food scene and should be able to come up with a few more items on the dinner menu.\n\nThe drink menu is great.  Make sure you get the Jalisco Holy Water.","1449":"The atmosphere is really great, with a Monet-style water lilies pond right out back and different themes rooms. The building itself fits in well with the artsy atmosphere of grounds for sculpture. Unfortunately, the food was only good, not great as I would have liked for the price, and the wait staff acted strangely. 3.5 stars.","1450":"Fantastic!!! the food is amazing!!\n\nOn Mother's Day I ordered the duck and waffles. Amazing!!! The cinnamon butter blended perfectly with my waffles. The duck was seasoned to perfection and tender. Great great restaurant!","1451":"I'm doing an update of the Parrish because they were given a really nice write up in the Caliente section of our newspaper. So that sparked my interest to once again test more menu selections..  We got to the place at 5.00PM on Saturday  and it was pretty full.  They have a large drink menu with all sorts of Vodka choices. The bar accomodates a lot of folks   and it was hopping.  They have an outdoor area in front of the Restaurant  which faces the parking lot.  So if you are into watching cars go in and out you can sit there. .  Fumes and exhausts don't exactly pair up with dining in my humble opinion.  The crowd was mixed ages and I noticed it to be an older crowd which was somewhat surprising.  Glad we are still \"HIP\" in our later years. It  took about 15 minutes for the manager take our order.The server never did come. I guess that was one flaw. But not a big deal.  We once again ordered  their signature \"nosh\" which is the bacon popcorn.  Hubby and I devoured it in seconds and never regretted the bacon grease, garlic and popcorn entering our arteries.  It is really worth it.  Yummo!!! The menu is small so the decision was not an overwhelming one.  Hubby chose  the Eggplant Patty which is chopped eggplant with other unknowns and grilled like a burger.  He really enjoyed that dish. It actually looked exactly like a hamburger.   I had the Fish  n' chips which was tillapia deep fried in oil.  Hopefully not the bacon grease.  It was really tasty and would get it again.  Both came with fries or a choice of cole slaw.  We chose the fries and it was quite good.  Next time we will try the Crawfish Hushpuppies which is a crowd pleaser from what I read. All in all a great experience.  One of the owner's stopped by the table to ask how everything was.  We gave him a big thumbs up.","1452":"The decor is unconventional and different. There are so many tables and seating arrangements to choose from, if you have taken a look around. You can sit either indoors, outdoors, or on mats in a booth blocked by a beaded curtain. Food-wise my mussels and frites were good. I did not get a mouthful of  sea, and they were sitting in this sweet buttery stew. My blackberry fizz was sub par, but the other drinks sounded good so I would still like to go back and try them out (i.e. melon mint). My friend's iced tea was a bit watered down, too, so the non-alcoholic beverages might be a bit lacking. My friend order a gazpacho which I thought was refreshing and flavorful, but she thought it was too salty. The desserts were spectacular, and if the drinks or entrees were as impressive, this place would be a solid 5. The desserts were great in presentation and flavor. I had a chilled blueberry soup with mascarpone ice cream, garnished with a mint leaf-not too sweet or sour which blueberries and dessert often risk. Excellent and cleaned my pallet. Our waiter was attentive without hovering.","1453":"Our meal was so so so good.\n\nWhile trying to decide on a pre-valentines day meal, I kept coming back to Parish. The menu had so many amazing sounding options and we were not disappointed.\n\nThanks to the large Parish sign we were able to find the restaurant without a lot of difficulty. I think some people equate strip malls with bad meals but I have found the exact opposite to almost always be the truth. The atmosphere inside is super casual. It's not going to blow your date away but the food will, and that's why we came. \n\nWe started with the baked oysters bleu. I thought they were good, though not great, and I probably would not get them again. My fiance on the other hand loved them and kept going on and on about how good they were. It must be a taste thing. Our drinks were also good. I got a hot chocolate cocktail that was just what I wanted and was expecting. Fiance got a beer which he was pleasantly surprised to find was only 3 dollars thanks to happy hour.\n\nNow on to the important part, the entrees. Amazing. I got the drunken angel which was so flavorful. It was spicy and creamy and delicious. Fiance got the shrimp and grits. It was amazing too. I actually think I was a little jealous of how good it was. The sauce that the shrimp was in was fantastic.\n\nWe skipped out on dessert but were tempted by the king cake. Service was great throughout the meal as well-Attentive, friendly, and efficient.\n\nYou made me a fan Parish and I will definitely be back.","1454":"I spotted this while searching Yelp in our hotel room.  Looks very promising, and not far from the hotel.\n\nWe ordered a variety of things.  The hush puppies were really good. Sauce was a little sweet. The puppies had a little kick.  They are more than just some deep fried bread dough!  They have crawfish and some seasoning.  Excellent appetizer.\n\nMy wife got a gumbo (andouille).  She can't have shrimp, so did not get that version.  It was very good.  I got to try it, and it tasted homemade.  Perhaps not as good as my wife does at home (she has an awesome gumbo), but you could taste that they had done the roux right, and the seasoning was excellent.\n\nBBQ pork was different but good. Fries were a but mushy.  Daughter ordered this one, and again I had a taste.  She seemed to like it. But they should figure a way to prepare\/serve the fries so they don't get mushy.\n\nI ordered the Drunkin Angel.  It was really good.  I liked the flavor.  It was a unique dish.  The pasta was perhaps a bit overcooked (most foodies will tell you that pasta should be al-dente...tender but not really soft).  Also, the cheese wasn't distributed well, so it ended up as a blob on the top of the dish.  I tried stirring it in, relying on the heat of the dish to melt it more and distributed it better.  It only marginally worked as I had hoped.  This might have been a five-star dish except for those two things.\n\nDaughter ordered a King's cooler,  She liked it a lot, saying it was refreshing.\n\nA bit pricey, but excellent service and good food.  I feel comfortable awarding 4 stars.","1455":"This place has a fantastic happy hour, but the real draw is the appetizers.  Filling, wholesome and savory: they all pair great with one of the great beers on tap.  \n\nI'll admit that only one person got an entree (the gumbo) but she cleaned the plate.  The rest of us enjoyed bacon popcorn, pimpanadas and southern edemame.  The table favorite though, was the Goat Cheese Relleno.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this place for larger groups.  The interior is really cool, but it still has a bit of a warehouse feel that could be daunting to a table for two.  \n\nHowever, with a decent sized group, this is a fantastic place to have a pint or cocktail and a lot of laughs.","1456":"We had a great experience here. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Our server Kelsey was extremely pleasant and continuously smiling. They have great drinks and infuse a ton of liquor there, so there's something for everyone! We will definitely be back and bring some friends.","1457":"Food is delicious. Atmosphere is lovely. Service is very slow. Is it busy, yes. But it's been an hour since we have been seated and still don't have our entree.","1458":"Stopped in this week and am gonna have to bring them down a star.  They had the most awesome Sleepy Dog Red Rover Ale on draft and they swapped it out for a hefeweizen.  Honestly. I would drive across town for a good beer on draft but i wouldn't drive six blocks for a run-of-the-mill hefeweizen.  Shame.  (If it ain't broke, don't fix it.)  \n\nGotta say the same about the new change in menu.  Don't get me wrong, I still like Po Boy and the Parish Burger and the Fish and Chips but the appetizers are lacking.  They have a really good oyster appetizer and, of course, the bacon popcorn will always be good but they get old after a while so I'm looking for the awesome wings they had - which are gone now.  \n\nI just don't understand change for the sake of change.  If you've got something that works - keep it.  I'll probably go back - I'm pulling for these guys - but not as often for sure.  Even the crowd seemed to realize it because it was pretty thin.  Shame.","1459":"I happened on to this restaurant while staying nearby and attending the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show. I was awed by the originality and inventiveness of the food and I ended up returning to dine again. On both occasions I was impressed by the quality and responsiveness of the wait staff and the receptionist. The dishes I ordered were superb and unique, familiar yet different in unexpected but very pleasant ways. For example, the endamame was slightly salty but refreshingly spicy. The baked oysters blue were crunchy with panko but also filled with additional flavors that complemented the taste of the oysters. The grilled ruby red trout was intensely flavored and served with black rice, an unusual treat, also flavorful, and a cajun mix of roasted vegetables - all complementary with the main dish. Finally, on both nights musical guests were featured who were virtuosos which added to the pleasant ambiance. All considered, this is one of the finest restaurants I have sampled in the past year and without a doubt the standout of my 10 day visit to Tucson!","1460":"The restaurant is very crowded. We had the Sunday brunch buffet, which is ok. I can see why lots of comments saying the Buffet is overrated and overpriced. Meat is cold. The sample dessert is very sugar filled and bad quality. A $ 45 price per person can buy you a really nice dinner in the city or  for a three course restaurant week menu, but I don't feel the buffet worth the money.\nAvoid the buffet as possible as you can.","1461":"Just alot of fun in a beautiful place !!!  Bar is quite small so be prepared to wait for a drink during happy hour, and sitting in the bar area is first come.  Food is great, drinks are good - but bring some cash, not cheap.","1462":"I was excited to take friends from Los Angles to Rats for the entire experience. The venue is amazing. I was shocked as a member that I had to pay an additional $6 per person to walk in the garden before dinner. With the upscale price of a meal, the walk in the gardens should be included.I had the Roasted Griggstown Chicken, it was nothing special. One guest had the Short Rib dinner. It was dry and unappealing. She asked for more sauce to moisten the short ribs and was given a small salt cellar, less than half full. The mussels et frites was well received.","1463":"Absolutely delicious way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon! Amazing gardens with incredible art followed by a spectacular lunch at Rats! The food was top notch, the staff was on top of their game and the atmosphere was perfect. \nWe had Mezze appetizers which was a perfect combination of delicious starters, a beautifully fresh apple and Bleau cheese salad, the fish of the day which was the trout and was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp skin and an eggplant mignon in a ratatouille that was amazing!\nDefinitely worth the trip in every way!","1464":"Have eaten here on 2 different occasions, and was not disapointed. It is a very relaxed atmoshere at the Grounds for the Sculpture location. The food is inovative, fresh and well prepared. The flavors will amaze you!. So far we have tried most of the menu between us and our parties, and nothing disapoints. I do not mind paying a bit more for gormet eating, and this is deffintely worth the price. Enjoy your meal and take in the coziness of your surroundings.","1465":"What a fun find! Atmosphere is quirky but friendly - just as good for a meal as it is for a drink. Food selection is definitely not the largest around, but even if Southern food isn't your preference, the complexity and quality of the food won't disappoint. Try the burgers - they're incredible. The beer selection is also stellar.","1466":"Rat's has a lot of reviews so I wont bore you with a repetitious review. I visited on a Saturday night and this place was packed.  We had some time before our reservation so we walked around the grounds (not too far though because I'm the idiot that forgot a coat). Not one nook or cranny in this entire place was missing an exquisite detail. The grounds and the restaurant (even in the dead of winter) were breathtaking and romantic. The winding path around the exterior of the restaurant led us to hidden gems of art. The \"Employee Shower\" caught us by surprise! The food was excellent, fresh and perfectly prepared. The service was on point and their attention to detail was distinct. If you are reading these reviews to give you reason to visit I really do encourage you to go, you will not be disappointed.","1467":"Grounds For Sculpture's charming restaurant, Rat's,is an absolutely perfect place to take a date!  Frankly, if you really want to impress a husband\/wife, boyfriend\/girlfriend or love interest, take them to Grounds for Sculpture in the afternoon, and then begin the evening at Rat's Lounge, then lead them to dinner out on the terrace, overlooking the replica of Claude Monet's Lily pond and bridge, and finally take a moonlit stroll of the Grounds before you whisk them back home. \n\nYou see, Rat's is designed to make visitors feel they have stepped into a village reminiscent of French impressionist Claude Monet's beloved town of Giverny.  Rat's indoor and outdoor dining offers magical and romantic ambiance for dining and is lovely complement to the Grounds For Sculpture experience.   The Lounge at Rat's Restaurant offers an exotic escape to rest and enjoy- you see the bar looks like it's a scene from Casablanca.\n\nService was impeccable, and when I went in late June everyone from the hostess to the bus-boy was chipper and accommodating.  If you go for dinner, ask for Marco- he has wonderful recommendations and is very jovial.\n\nAs far as the food and drink goes- they are divine- the dinner menu is a cosmopolitan take on home cooking, with French influences.  My boyfriend and I shared the Petit Escargot (sweet and succulent- and the sauce was great for sopping) as well as the Artisanal Cheese plate (too much blue cheese represented for my liking, by my boyfriend LOVED it).  For our Main Course my boyfriend had the Filet Mignon, which was perfectly medium-rare and very tasty, and I had the Duck Breast, which was very juicy and done perfectly.  Dessert was a shared Berry Crisp which was divine with vanilla ice cream.  Lastly I really must mention that the Rat's Artist Series Red 2003 was amazing; we are considering on buying a case- it was THAT good.","1468":"Went there for lunch today. Terrible food. The burger was sent back twice for being rare, yet the cheese and bacon on top were burnt and \"melted away.\" The onion soup was very salty. The people next to us were very unhappy as well. This place is not cheap - it should have been much better. The Peacock Cafe at the Grounds for Sculpture has more choices, healthier, cheaper and tastes better!\nOur server was nice but the food - not acceptable.","1469":"Rat\"s was wonderful.  Service was attentive, ambiance was wonderful.  A perfect afternoon.  My only negative thought was perhaps the menu could be a little more extensive .  The dishes we had were excellent. My husband had the chicken in the clay pot and I had the crisp shrimp.","1470":"This is actually a 3.5 star review, but I rounded up instead of down.  This place has such a great concept!  I'm typically not a fan of the gastropub theme that seems to be everywhere nowadays, but southern inspired gastropub?  I had to try it!  On a visit from Phoenix, I came here with a girlfriend and my daughter.  My girlfriend and I had a late lunch, so we weren't starving.  We started off with some apps -- the crawfish hushpuppies, edamame and fries with truffle aioli.  The crawfish hushpuppies were really good, although they were much better without the sauce.  We didn't think the sauce went great with the flavor of the hushpuppies.  The fries and the aioli were great -- the fries were seasoned really well and who doesn't love a little truffle with their fries?  The edamame was underwhelming.  They were supposed to have some kind of seasoning on them, but you could barely tell.  I was stuffed after all those apps, so my girlfriend and I just split an order of the bacon wrapped frog legs, while my daughter ordered the Drunken Angel dish.  The frog legs were good, but I don't know that I'd order them again.  Definitely good, just not unforgettable.  My daughter absolutely loved her dish, which was angel hair pasta with crawfish and shrimp in a lobster sauce.  I tasted it also and agree that it had good flavor.  I also had a Caribbean Mule drink, which I liked -- it was really refreshing.  \n\nThey have live music on a regular basis, and when we were there a bluegrass band was setting up literally right next to our table.  I don't know that I would have enjoyed my dinner with the band playing so close to our table, so I was glad we finished and left before they started playing.","1471":"Sunday brunch has just about everything you can imagine. Salmon, NY strip, pork loin, lox, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc....and a $45 price tag. The food is great but in my opinion it's a little too expensive for brunch.","1472":"The food, service, and decor were all spectacular. The octopus appetizer is very well prepared; even in an email where everyone has octopus on the menu, this stands out. For an entree I had the lamb two ways, which was very good. The waiter recommended that I order the lamb medium rare, but if I could do it all over again I would probably order it rare. \n\nTake something from your meal home, they wrap it up in a foil rat... Pretty cute","1473":"I have been here three times now in the past couple of months and each time has been a great experience. Every time I have been seated promptly and greeted well by the staff. They have a decent selection of beer and the people I have dined with really liked the cocktails they have. Now on to the food:\n\nDrunken Angel\nProbably the best dish out of all the dishes I have tried. It is big on flavor and I find myself tempted to just order this every time I return (I have to remind myself to try other things on the menu). Every bite of the dish makes me want more. If the plating was any bigger I would definitely explode because its that delicious.\n\nMesquite Smoked Salmon\nI love salad and this fits the bill for all my personal salad tastes. Its sweet and tangy, and has a perfect amount of saltyness and savory flavors from the smoked salmon. If I am not getting the Drunken Angel, this would be my next go-to.\n\nThe Parish Burger\nI might be biased because I don't often order burgers, but this is just a good burger to me. Its got good flavor and the patty was cooked to my preference. \n\nCrawfish Hushpuppies\nFried little goodies. Great way to start off the meal. I also like the sauce a lot.\n\nI am definitely coming back here in the future and this is a place I would recommend to others as well.","1474":"This place is great.  The waitress Sara was the best server I have had in some 20+ yrs. The food was awesome loved the bacon popcorn. The price very reasonable. The atmosphere was very comfortable.","1475":"We just tried the tasting menu.  The Gastropub does not officially open until next week. \nOur theory was to order a few dishes and share to maximize the tasting.  This strategy works well because the portions are large.  \nThe Bacon Popcorn was the first thing we ordered. How can you not love bacon?  The chunks of bacon on the popcorn really do this appetizer justice.\nThe next dish to arrive were the Pretzel Bits.  The scratch made pretzel knots were piping hot and delicious.  The cheese dip that accompanies the bits was similar to a Velveeta like cheese sauce.  The spiciness of the dip went well with the pretzels.  However, a spicy mustard may make a better dipper.\nThe entrees arrived next.  Haitian pulled pork sandwich, Shrimp Po Boy and Lamb Chorizo flat bread.  \nThe flat bread was the least favorite.  In concept, lamb chorizo sounds phenomenal.  The flat bread was heavily salted on both the top and bottom.  The salt in combination with the overpowering olive tapenade left little room for the lamb chorizo to stand out.  The spice of the dish was on point.  However, the only distinguishable flavor was salt.  \nThe Haitian pulled pork was topped with a vinegar based slaw.  The meat and cabbage complimented each other perfectly.  The spice in the pork was a pleasant surprise.  \nGumbo can be added to the entrees for $2.  Well worth the price.  The gumbo was on point.  Served in a cup it comes out piping hot.  The consistency and flavor are all there.\nThe Shrimp Po Boy was the stand out dish.  The shrimp are coated in a crispy cornmeal and cooked just right.  Piled high on a bed of lettuce and tomato with a house made remoulade sauce.  The bread stands up well to the tower of ingredients.  The one and only thing missing was spice to kick it up another notch.  A good serving of hot sauce would have put it over the top.\nIf it is true Cajun food you are seeking, you must check out The Parish Gastropub.\nNext time, we have to try the basil vodka and craw fish hush puppies.   This is the ideal spot to watch sports.  Not too loud, just a few bar stools with plenty of TVs.","1476":"Mostly disappointed in the service today. Dirty silverware and absent waitress. Happy hour food was good. Not as good as dinner. Duck poop everywhere by the outside tables. Ducks begging for food right at your feet. Staff did nothing about this.","1477":"Excellent service. Great food. Hospitable management. One of the best dinner services I've ever experienced.","1478":"First time diners at The Parrish, and we expect to return. We arrived 10 minutes early but our table was ready quickly. \n\nHaving read comments about the Crawfish Hushpuppies we ordered them with the evenings Peach Mule special drinks. My first impression when they arrived was that they must be overlooked -but not at all. They were perfect. My wife claims they were the best she ever had-though I've never met one I didn't like. These were much less dry on the inside and just wonderful. My Shrimp and Grits were kind of a mixed bag. The shrimp and BBQ cream sauce were point on. The grit cakes however while enjoyable left me wishing for the more traditional version. Collared greens were smoking hot and tasty but I expected perhaps a little vinegar taste. The wife had the smoked version of the pasta and liked it though thought it just a little too rich. She loved the huge slice of toasted bread that arrived on top of her pasta. We ended with the house bread pudding which in short was out of this world. \n\nI did see lots of great looking burgers being delivered as well as the fish and chips. \n\nFinally a shout out to our server Jessie and the rest of the efficient, friendly staff. This level attention adds a lot to the dining experience. Highly recommended.","1479":"Solid place.  Had a nice sandwich on Texas toast here.  Also got a pretty fun salad with nuts\/pomegranate seeds\/lardons that was quite good. very filling.  Love the local artwork on the walls.","1480":"A few weeks ago we ate at Rat's and had somewhat of a mixed experience. They gain points for having an adorable, homey, almost Mother goose like cottage ambiance that was warm and welcoming but still fancy. This is not a place to wear your old holey jeans, that's for sure. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable, but not so much as to be obnoxious.\n \n   Our very nice waitress, who wore some tasteful facial piercings (welcomed in a place that borders on a little stuffy)  informed us that if we didn't understand any of the terms on the menu she would explain them to us.  For an appetizer we got the ceviche of Ahi and Scallop. It was plated beautifully and very tasty but we didn't finish it. I am not sure why, it just didn't grab us. \n\n   While we were waiting for our next course, we were given some very yummy raisin bread and herb butter which for me, was one the best things we had (hmmm). Our meals arrived shorty after. My dinning mate got the grouper and I got the hanger steak. I tasted his and it was just okay - perfectly cooked, but didn't wow me and it was somewhat a small portion for the price. However, my steak and fries were amazing.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It was the kind of steak you put in your mouth and close your eyes and know this is why God made cows.\n   \n     The real disappointment of Rat's was the dessert. I got the chocolate zucchini cake and it was kind of doughy and tasteless. I make a way better chocolate zucchini cake. It needed dark chocolate glaze and some spices in the cake maybe. My dining mate got the lavender peaches. Now, okay, we knew there was lavender in it but there was so much that it kind of tasted like eating peaches soaked in bathroom soap.\n    \n     Overall it was a really enjoyable dinning experience and I would go back for a special occasion sometime, but nothing I am going to stay awake at night fantasizing about . Being so close to Philadelphia, there are comparable or even better places to drop that kind of cash.","1481":"I think The Parish is a solid three-star. The space is pretty small, but doesn't feel cozy. It's got that sparse feel I'm not a fan of with some really odd paint choices (yes, I get they are Mardi Gras colors, but this is pretty literal). \n\nWe ordered the jerk chicken empenadas to start and neither of us was a fan. They were a bit dry and had a strong ginger taste - but I'm not a ginger person. \n\nI got the fish and chips. They were definitely crispy - in fact, the fish was pretty close to perfect. So bravo for that. It would have been a great meal if it had some coleslaw. \n\nMy husband got the crazy hotdog and enjoyed it. Our friends also seemed to like what they had. \n\nThe server was very friendly, but we had to ask for water two or three times. \n\nI like the concept of the food and I might be back, but I'm not running.","1482":"I went here while I was in Tucson for work.  The staff was super Friendly the gumbo was delis hand the beer menu was amazing!  The guy sitting next to me had the shrimp and grits and it smelled like heaven! You can't go wrong.","1483":"Cool Hand Lu Says; Nice ambiance and decent food selection.  Probably can skip the buffet for the price point.\n\nI came here for brunch after church service in a party of 8 adults and two children.  Driving up to the restaurant was interesting as there were numerous sculptures along the way.  The statues that are placed around the grounds give it an amusement park type feel.\n\nThere was a bit of a hiccup on our seating, but to compensate, we were given two rounds of mimosas.  (Much appreciated).  \n\nOnce seated, and given time to review the menus I made the decision to go for their burger.  The brunch buffet, while I'm sure was tasty didn't seem worth $45 to me.  There was also an issue with an a la cart menu for lunch being posted on the website but not available at the restaurant and also unaware of by our waitress.  Needless to say that was a bit frustrating to one of my friends but the manager was able to accommodate her and gave her a brunch item that she wanted.\n\nOne surprising thing which we were told to be part of French cuisine is that the entrees were not started until the appetizers were finished.  So we had to wait a little bit longer for our food as a result. But once it came all was well.\n\nThe burger was cooked well and was satisfying.  Probably would have tasted even better with some dijon mustard but I forgot to ask.  The platter of desserts they gave afterward was also really tasty.  The carrot cake in particular.\n\nSince this spot is a bit far from Brooklyn so I probably won't be getting back to it anytime soon but it was a nice experience.","1484":"Did not like the food.  The restaurant is beautiful inside and outside.  If you have an opportunity to go to ground sculpture and later go to the restaurant it will be nice.  I still will come back and will try something else on the menu","1485":"I attended The Parish on a Friday night about seven pm. I had the classic chicken wings and handcut fries. The wings were tender and flavorful without going over the top with heat. The fries were fresh, hot and seasoned perfectly(for my taste). I ordered the aqua vita and was very pleasantly surprised. It was very elegantly served and garnished with a basil leaf. Very tasy cocktail. The service was outstanding, my server went out of his way to take care of a special request. I am going to have to give my experience this evening five stars.","1486":"The best! We had a great meal, the hostess was very nice, and I love the renovations that happened over the winter.","1487":"Would like to give 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4 based on service and the drink menu. Had a group from work head to The Parish tonight and had great service with a big group from our server Jill. There's a good beer list and a lot of great specialty drinks, I had La Verdad which I'd highly recommend -reminiscent of a Moscow mule with tequila. \n\nOur table tried a few of the appetizers. I got the fresh oysters, which came with a really great smoked tomato sauce. They were mild but tasty. Other big hits at the table were the bacon popcorn and the frog legs. \n\nOur entrees is where things seemed to miss the mark for the group. I had the trout which was good-okay, if a little bland. I had to salt it, and I can't remember the last time I salted food at a restaurant. A couple of us got the Drunken Angel, which I tried and was great. There was another angel hair pasta dish that was way too heavy both in richness and smoke, and a couple of the guys got the special, a seafood gumbo, which didn't seem to impress either of them that much. \n\nIn a nutshell, it just seemed like everything entree-wise that I tried lacked balance. Especially at the price point, in Tucson, I expect a bit more balance and complexity. I'll definitely be back (great ambiance and live music are a total win), but I'll definitely be trying my luck with other entrees.","1488":"On day I was rather bored and decided to explore new restaurants listed on OpenTable.com.  I had used the site many times to reserve seats in Manhattan, but I did not have a grip on local New Jersey spots.  I scanned the list and came across the curious name of \"Rat's Restaurant\".  The destination did not sound appealing, but I was intrigued.  I clicked the link to gather additional information and discovered that the restaurant was actually a sprawling wooden building overlooking a pond at a beautiful art park called The Grounds for Sculpture.  I was in awe of the sheer uniqueness of the facilities.  This was a special occasion spot for sure, so I added it to my mental wish list.\n\nThis past month, my brother was turning the big 2-5, and I wanted to take him somewhere special.  Rat's seemed like more of a romantic destination, but I was curious to see what it was all about.  I also knew that he would think it was something new and different.  I was easily able to make a reservation and had my brother save the evening.  I kept him in suspense on our long drive down to the Princeton area.  I had planned to get us there early so that we could explore the grounds, but we wound up getting stuck in major traffic.  By the time we arrived, the indoor sculpture galleries were closed.  Luckily, one of the sweet employees allowed us to take a quick run through of the space, and even provided us with complimentary pamphlets on the park.  We took some snapshots and headed to the restaurant for dinner.  \n\nWe pulled into the dazzling parking lot that was illuminated by the sprawling farmhouse.  We walked through the front door and discovered an entrance way adorned with country-style decor and accessories, such as cast-iron skillets.  We approached the host stand, completely charmed.  We were promptly escorted through the two lovely downstairs dining rooms and taken to the comfortable upstairs space.  \n\nRight after we sat, a friendly bread server stopped by with a basket of popovers and a warning that we better sample this batch while it was hot.  The warm, airy popovers were fresh from oven and a great way to take the edge off while perusing the substantial menu.  We inhaled the crusty treat and deliberated our options of a la carte and tasting menus.  The waitress approached, bringing an air of snootiness along with her.  She made us feel out of place and too young to be in a space of that caliber.  Little did she know about my review hobby ;-)  Regardless, we were not thrilled by the tasting menu options and settled on a spread of a la carte dishes instead.  Though we thought the popovers were our starting gift, we were soon offered additional doughy slices from a large bread basket.  The moist garlic bread was toughened up by a crisp, seasoned crust.  A dense cinnamon raisin bread was the best of the bunch, and a homemade focaccia was also available.\n\nWe tried to save room for our ordered courses, but then received another surprise - an amuse bouche of creamy tomato soup.  The thick puree was served in a tall, thin shot glass and topped with two tiny croutons.  The mixture was flavorful, but so dense that it should have been plated in an espresso mug to allow for easier consumption.\n\nFinally, we received the dishes that we actually ordered.  Our Venison Carpaccio appetizer contained thinly cut, rare meat.  It was topped with red mustard, pomegranate, celery tempura, and Asian pear.  The added fruit donated texture and sweetness, but the other ingredients were virtually non-existent.  This starter definitely needed more seasoning.  The Butternut Squash Risotto appetizer, however, was much better. The risotto was perfectly executed without clumping.  It was tossed with small pieces of Taylor Bay scallops, large chestnuts, and drizzles of olive oil.  Hard, savory Parmesan crisps were added as garnish.  The scallops and chestnuts were fantastic and the main flavor components on the plate.  I just wished there were more pieces of them.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Apple Cider Sable Fish, which was unreal.  The fish had a crispy, sweet crust. It was served with a buttery cauliflower puree and salty brussel sprouts.  Apple chips and black truffles enhanced the green vegetables, adding a rich and seasonal depth to the plate.  My brother's Griggstown Cornish Hen was moist and delicious.  It was served with tart cranberries and a garlic sausage bread pudding.  The cranberries added a balanced sweetness, but the bread pudding had barely any garlic flavor.\n\n(Ran out of room - rest of review will be posted in an \"Update\" when available tomorrow.)","1489":"Hey, I just love this place. Great food, great service, cool decor and Live Music. One of our favorite places in Tucson. A little small, and it fills up fast, so expect a wait on weekends, but it's worth it......try the Bacon Popcorn. Bartenders are top notch, and they have one of the best pastry chef's around..","1490":"the place was fine...\n\natmosphere: went for brunch on sunday and it was a nice - we had a seat right next to the fireplace. \n\nfood: they have a buffet of appetizer choices which isnt that bad - there was hummus, bagels, lox, shrimp, and fruit.  however, while the main dish choices sounded yummy they did not deliver.  the cheeseburger was small and when we asked that the grilled tomato be served on the side they didnt do it.  the eggs benedict was more deconstructed and served upside down with the brioche popover on top.  the problem was that the eggs werent drained well and there was water all over the plate.  the waiter was nice enough to fix the problem and bring a new dish but then proceeded to argue that the liquid on the plate wasnt water but was just a runny egg and it was my friends taste that was the problem - not good.  the steak was small and nothing special.  the dessert buffet was tiny and lacking while the coffee was just plain bad.\n\nso basically, for 39 bucks a person and a free glass of champagne it was fine, but i wouldnt go back without a gift certificate.","1491":"Every once in a while I am surprised to find an outstanding eatery off the beaten track (at least our track), and what was meant to be a casual \"blue collar\" dinner makes me feel like I should have dressed up, not for the ambiance at The Parish, but in honor of the chef who gave us a real nice dining experience for the price of bar food. We were greeted by and served by Andrew (good luck, buddy!) and began with four of the nicest oysters this side of Tomales bay. The Drunken Angel was superb, and the Gumbo was equally delicious. To top it off, we shared a bread pudding that was the best I've ever had! My only disappointment was forgetting to snap a photo to share.\nAn outstanding evening! Thanks!!","1492":"Two bread services - yes please.  The first bread course was really good with a great compound butter, but the second course which is their popovers are frickin awesome.  I could jsut eat these and be good.  Appetizer of Pork Rillettes was very good except why there was one instead of two cornichons is beyond me.  Entrees were really good and my steak was done to perfection, as was the Salmon.  Dessert and cappuccino was really good, the special dessert was ice cream sandwiches (two) and both were excellent.  This place is so beautiful and the service was really good  with a few minor issues - not having coffee come out with dessert and leaving me briefly with a steak and no steak knife.   I am torn between a 3.5 and a 4, so we will go back and I will update.","1493":"I have family from New Orleans, so the name caught my attention.  They have wine, mixed drinks and a wide variety of beers on tab.  My party had gumbo, drunken angel, smoked angel, and the BBQ sandwich...all were good.  We also got the fish and chips which we were not a fan of.  They got soggy very fast and were fishier than I prefer.\nWe went on a Sunday night and they have live music starting at 6:00.  The place became very busy around 5:30, so either come early or make a reservation.  The entertainment...Andy ?...added a great touch to the ambience.  Service was on point.","1494":"\"Amazing food and customer service beyond expectations!!! It was a delightful dinner and special occasion that I am glad to have shared with some of the Rat's Restaurant staff.  I could give you more minor details if you wish to email me.  (john_calderone2003@yahoo.com)\nYou see, let me explain by giving you a quick overview.  I pulled a fast surprise on my girlfriend, now fianc\u00e9e, for my birthday dinner, on a busy Saturday evening at Rat's.  I had them bring a desert that was marked \"will you marry me?\"  A lot of preparations had to be communicated to the management (some might say I was kind of annoying, even picking the exact table to sit at) The General Manager, Richard, was away on travels but quickly forwarded my email to the Assistant Manager, Alan.  Within a day, Alan emailed me ensuring everything was setup and they can handle the requests for such a special occasion.  \nI even asked the management to be able to take a quick picture or video of the occasion during the proposal.  Much to my dismay, after the proposal, I had 5 video's sitting in my email inbox.  There was even a video of making of the desert plate and its meticulous detailed heart.\nAs for the food, absolutely amazing flavors.  I have been to famous food network chef's restaurant, as well as some dives.  This food is absolutely a memorable meal that compares to some of the best celeb chef's.  I started with the grilled Spanish octopus, while my fianc\u00e9e had the Proven\u00e7al Mezze for the Table.  The octopus was so tender and palatable.  The Provencal mezze had an array of humus, olives, quinoa, and eggplant tapenade.  For our entr\u00e9e's, I tried the tasting of the lamb while my fianc\u00e9e had the filet.  The lamb was perfectly cooked to my liking, while my fianc\u00e9e's filet was a bit tough, but the manager quickly addressed this immediately.\nThank you, Rat's staff, for making this engagement proposal a very memorable.\"","1495":"We were a party of 6. All our dishes were great, but the service was lacking, especially for a place like Rats. What should have been a two hour meal was two hours fifty minutes. Dessert took 30 minutes to arrive. Servers left our empty dinner plates on the table for 20 minutes after we were all finished eating. The cheese assortment was good but there were only two skimpy thin crackers that came with it. It also took way too long to get our bottle of wine. Water glasses weren't refilled in a timely fashion.\n\nWe've been here 3 times, and this time was definitely much different than the previous two.","1496":"Went in for lunch today and it was terrific! Started with frog legs, juicy, crispy, and bacon cooked to perfection! The sauce that came with the legs were heavenly! We even kept the sauce for our fries, that's how much we loved it! Also ordered the Haitian pork sandwich and fish and chips.\nSandwich- amazing, excellent use of acidity with tender pork. Nothing mushy about it, which is rare. \nFish and chips- great! Really the crispiest fish I have had in Tucson! The fish was so moist, the fries were so well seasoned and not overly salty. \nService was excellent, friendly and prompt.\nLoved the cocktail menu, I had the porch tea, it was boozy yet not overwhelming.\nIf you like spirit forward drinks, my bf ordered the doctor and sazerac, both excellent in his opinion. \nThere was bread pudding for dessert, and I really wanted it, but I was so full.\nYou need to eat here- it's an experience you won't forget, from the service, the food, and the ambience. \nI can't wait to go back!","1497":"The food is unique. Very tasty. Drunken Angel pasta and the Ruby Red Trout are very good. They make some very original drinks. Music was pleasing. This place is great. The problem with telling this is that more people will go.","1498":"This is hands down, one of the best new finds in Tucson. The burger might actually be the best burger I have ever had (Sorry downtown kitchen. Your burger will always have a special place in my heart but maybe we should just be friends). The red onion marmalade paired with the blue cheese is what really makes it. The bacon popcorn is peppery and delicious and doesn't equate tot he greasy mess that one might assume when reading the menu. It's 3 dollars and a must order. The place is small but cozy and the service has never been anything but helpful and attentive. Perhaps the best thing I can say about this place is that it is nice to finally see a gastropub in Tucson that seems to have put more emphasis on it's food than it's image. The Parish delivers and it's only a matter of time before I'l be back again and again.","1499":"Nice setting, great service, but only so-so food. I really wish there was a place in Tucson that  had decent Oyster Po Boys. The servers and management here was appropriately attentive and the food was ok, but I am not sure it was enough to get me to come back. Might have to try it for appetizers and drinks sometime just because our service was so good.","1500":"We found this restaurant online, but it had also been recommended to my daughter by a friend of the owner.  Did not disappoint!  Everything we ate was incredible!  The menu appeals to all types of people; my son is vegetarian and he found a few choices that would suit him.  Top notch service was provided by our server, Lawson!  Thanks for providing our family a unique eating experience, that was not a chain!","1501":"Went back to Rats on Saturday night. Haven't been there since Steven Star took over. Same deal as last time. We had a reservation for a table of four at 5:15 (they open at 5). Again they sat us right next to the only other couple in the room. No big deal, it's just odd, and the people they sat us next to looked like someone just kicked their puppy. They didn't speak and it was obvious that they were just sitting there listening to our conversation. No fought of the restaurant, just an example of the type of clientele. Our server did an excellent job the entire evening but I must say that it sucks when you can barley understand what they're saying because of a thick accent. I'm not a Trump supporter or anything, I just wish I didn't have to ask for the specials to be repeated over and over. \n\nAbout the menu: The drinks, especially the wine, are over priced. For a glass they charge the price of a full bottle. And many times they don't list the vintage. On the other hand, my wife did mention that her gin drink was a really hefty pour. Also, they have a Kobe steak dish for $38. I can't even buy a raw kobe steak for that. I doubt it's really Kobe, but maybe they get a really good deal from there purveyor. If not, it should say Kobe style american. Plus I found it odd to be at a French fine dining restaurant and didn't have any truffle dishes. \n\nThe food is always pretty good, not great. I had the Choucroute (pork collar). A really small piece of meat that was really tender, but tasted like roast beef. Not crispy at all, basically a $40 piece of roast pork, a few under cooked pieces of belly and super salty sausage and sour salt kraut. It was supposed to be garlic sausage, but I didn't get any garlic flavor, in fact the whole dish was pretty bland. Also, I would have needed a magnifying glass to find the potatoes. It said that there was a wine sauce but it just seemed watery. I wouldn't order it again. \n\nI really don't see any changes since Mr. Starr took it over. We only went cause we had a gift card. $250 bucks later I wasn't impressed. A few later I made some frozen pizza in the toaster over since my belly was growling.","1502":"Once again on the road traveling and always looking for that non chain place to eat. Jumped on Yelp to find that next adventure and it brought me to the Parish. \n\nI ordered take out of Drunkin Angel. Wanted a little seafood and why not the Drunkin Angel. The Drunkin Angel consists of Angel hair pasta, lobster sauce, shrimp and craw fish.  Also accompanied by a couple of pieces of bread. Let's just say it was a great meal and the flavor was outstanding and the bread had a grill\/smoky taste to it and mopping up the sauce with it was outstanding. \n\nIf I was in the area again I would definitely dine here again.","1503":"Good eats, good beer and bar so it's a great start. Limited munu, some dishes we tried weren't up to our liking, but over all it was nice. Don't rely on the server's impression of the menu. Description was not consistent with what was served, one missed out of four.","1504":"Way overpriced brunch buffet @ $46.92 + tip. Mundane standard brunch fare. Shrimp dish was over cooked. Mini croissants (not bad), however the baked mini scones on the table were dry and perhaps over baked. Mini bland desserts served at table. I don't recommend this brunch buffet. I'm sure you can get much better quality at a lower price in Trenton area. I don't understand the purpose or reason for water vapor\/spray being extruded on the outside of the restaurant as we left.","1505":"I came here for dinner on a Friday night and love the NOLA atmosphere with live music. I would even come here to just get drinks at the bar. \n\nI tried the mussels. The mussels themselves were just ok but the lamb sausage in the sauce was really good. The bread it came with and Sauce on top of it was not great. \n\nThe snapper was just ok. Seemed overcooked and not great flavor.  The drunken noodles were very good. The cocktails were excellent including a tom Collins and a Dutch Well Water (not sweet).","1506":"Simply amazing!!! The Shrimp and Grits with side collars greens  were to die for. The case iron corn bread is a winner as well. I'm a occasional drinker so when our waiter suggested the Front Porch Tea I wasn't expecting much. Delicious!!! My husband order the Johnny Steak and it was cooked to perfection. As a surprise our waiter came out with a complementary banana pudding for my birthday. Excellent service and meal. We will come back again and next time I'll order the bacon popcorn. Yes, bacon popcorn!","1507":"I had the double pork chop - way too much charred spices to allow me to enjoy it.\n\n Service was good and prices were okay. I would not go back.","1508":"I am overdue to redo my original review, which was 3 stars. Have been back multiple times since that 1st mediocre experience & I have become a fan.  #1 reason is still the food...it is ALWAYS excellent. Not a big fan of salmon but tried my wife's smoked salmon salad last time & it was the best salad I have ever had in my life. Seems like we have never had the same server more than twice, but service is always anywhere from very good to excellent. Still not crazy about the small draft beer selection & some of the ones offered, but they always have at least 2 I like, so even though I feel like the draft beer list is worth a 1\/2 star demerit, I'm gonna keep it at 5. To me there are several \"ultimate tests\" of a restaurant:\n1. Do you go back over & over?\n2. Do you recommend it to friends & family?\n3. Do you take friends & family to eat there?\n\nMy answer to all these is YES!","1509":"What a beautiful looking restaurant! The view and ambiance make this place worth it for sure.\nMy review is based solely on the food and not the price because I was graciously treated to this great restaurant.\n\nI came here with a friend and her parents and we remained in the bar because they were so busy they couldn't seat us. The bartender was actually pretty rude. I have bartended before and I can say he was quite rude. He never came to check whether we wanted anything else and at one point threw the credit card, a pen and the check on top of the bar table...no he did not place it down and slide it, he literally threw it at the patron. Very rude! That is the one reason this place gets 4 stars\n\nWe ordered the hummus app and the artisanal cheese. Very good portions and so, so tasty! All i had was the wine so I cannot review how good the cocktails are, although the bartender was so off putting i didnt even want to venture into ordering a cocktail from him.","1510":"Went down to THE PARISH on Feb 28, 2017. Yep, that is correct - Fat Tuesday and it was a Mardi Gras celebration. Well first the weather was not the best situation, but the staff outdid themselves by making sure that the guests had a great tent for live music outdoors and plenty of seating inside for the 2nd band. The bands were great - and there were several of them throughout the night, which made for a great variety of music selection. \n\nUpon entering the tent, in true Mardi Gras fashion, we were given beads to make sure we all had some celebration fashion going on. The first bar was the outdoor bar, attended by a wonderful young lady named 'Kelsey' who greeted us with a smile and quick service. Not only did she recommend a great beer, but exactly what was needed after a very long day. And when the second round came up, she remembered who we were and what was ordered by who. \n\nAfter wandering around the outside of the event and listening to a bit of the music, we wandered into the inside bar and restaurant. Second bar was packed with people standing and sitting around the area, some were even dancing up by the band. Very relaxed atmosphere and almost seemed like a small family town get together with food music and friends. \n\nWe ordered the Cajun Sampler which was special item that night. It included the favorites that most people would crave -- Red Beans and Rice, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Collard Greens, Cornbread, and Coleslaw - ---- Red beans and Rice were great - Jambalaya and Gumbo were just like homemade and the collard greens and cornbread brought back memories from childhood and grandma's cooking.... Coleslaw freshly made to perfection -  'Travis' - the Chef of the House was not only impressive in the overall cooking but made the flavors exquisite and just a wonderful experience for the palate and the fulfillment of the tummy - why not Fat Tuesday allows for a little indulgence and gluttony - well above any expectation.  - Couldnt forget the traditional \"KING CAKE\" - which was not only awesome and fantastic but just enough sweetness to require another round of drinks to wash it all down. \n\nAfter a great dinner and sitting out next to the outside bar and bands - a last peruse through the restaurant and the inside band. Bartender for the second bar inside was the absolutely wonderful Amber - who not only recognized us from previous visits but had a great smile and a perfect Mardi Gras outfit ... Made us feel as if we were visiting friends we just saw last week. Suggestions for drinks were not only appreciated but highly approved but hit the perfect spot to a long end of the day.\n\nThe staff is always a happy group who not only knows their stuff, but treats you like family or in some cases better than family .... Good food is not enough to compliment the delicious cuisine that we ate, but if you dont know what you want - ask the server to suggest something or maybe one of their favorites - you'll probably try something new and have a great meal to enjoy with it. My compliments go to everyone involved in a wonderful event and we are looking to visit again next year with many more of our friends .. but will be visiting monthly just to try anything new.... Great price, great food and great staff --- Thank you.","1511":"This place was AMAZING!\nStarted with the bacon popcorn appetizer, it was hot, salty and peppery- delicious. \nFor dinner had the gumbo (added crawfish) and hush puppies and they were equally good.  All of the food came out hot and was perfectly seasoned- exactly the flavors you should expect from authentic Southern food.  The cocktails were a great addition to the meal- I recommend the Kings Cooler.","1512":"Overall a great experience and solid cajun food the likes of which one normally finds much closer to the gulf.  \nFor appetizers we had the hush puppies and they were interesting but not exciting.  The mussels on the other hand were a sweet and savory delight that included the house smoked andouille sausage, fennel and who knows what else but it was the best thing we had and I would go back just for the mussels anytime.  We enjoyed a Callaghan 2006 Syrah that was very reasonably priced at $9 a glass and went well with the entire meal.\nI had the Shrimp and Grits and they were unique and tasty,  Grits were made into cakes and fried and the shrimp had a creamy garlicky sauce that was delicious.  My dining partners had a pasta dish and the Pork Chop and the pasta was good but the pork chop was  off the charts.  At least two inches thick, smoked  first then baked and it was utterly scrumptious.  I will return and I will have the chop.","1513":"This little place is charming, true to its roots, and always fun.  You should definitely try the Drunken Angel Pasta.  It's addictive...one of my favorite all time restaurant dishes.\n\nWe suggest it to our out of town guests all the time, and they always rave about it, too.","1514":"(Review Continued - Part 2):\nSurprisingly, we could not stop there.  My Trio of Sorbets dessert left me with mixed feelings.  The Green Apple was bland and way too creamy for a traditional sorbet.  The White Chocolate and Mango was a weird flavor combination, and the chocolate was imperceptible.  The Banana Passion was the best flavor, tasting like a clean balance of the two fruits.  The birthday boy's celebratory Chocolate Dome with Orange Creamcicle Panna Cotta was just decent.  The chocolate cake was bland, like something found at a cheap diner rather than a treat for real chocolate lovers.  The orange flavor was too artificial and over-powering. Just when our full bellies could take no more, we were delivered Petit Fours with our bill.  The chocolate chip cookie was hard and just mediocre.  The lemon jelly was also decent, but nothing special.  The mini mocha cheesecake was lacking in coffee flavor, but the cream cheese was smoother than anything I have tasted.  It was a treat for sure.\nI took care of the bill, which was surprisingly similar to what might be considered \"affordable\" in Manhattan, and we toured the rest of the elegant farmhouse.  The upstairs space also included a cozy \"member lounge\" for select patrons.  The downstairs bar area had a fantastic lounge, and a neighboring event space was perfect for weddings.  The host also enlightened us by explaining the grounds were lit at night.  He encouraged us to walk around, and we were glad we did since we had missed the indoor exhibits.\nThe Grounds for Sculpture was a beautiful facility and Rat's, while not spectacular, was much better than most restaurants with a view.","1515":"Very expensive! The food however is delicious and it is a very interesting themed restaurant. I loved the burger I ordered. It was to die for! However I didn't like the watermelon margarita too much and the chocolate cake needed more butter cream. I definitely recommended going here at least once through when you visit the sculpture gardens.","1516":"They don't accept reservations which sucks so coming on a weekend we waited for quite a long time (around 35 minutes) It is on the nicer side so most of the guests on the night I went were all dressed up very nicely. The inside of the restaurant is very cute and welcoming, the decor is appealing and it was very clean inside. The staff was quick and friendly and the food was very good. I will return and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others as well.","1517":"I go for their oyster poor boys, it is as good as I used to get in the LA bayous! Hush puppies and gumbo quite good as well.","1518":"Ambiance is everything! Plus there's one bartender that's awesome, taller guy with a beard, always great to chat with, knows a ton about beer and wine and always has a joke. The food is average- great options but I'm never blown away by execution.","1519":"It's ok. Not much to choose for vegetarians. The servings are quite small for a lunch entry.","1520":"Service, food, & creativity does not get better anywhere on the East Coast. Reclusive enclave renders worldly refuge in the middle of expansive, pastoral sculpture gardens.  Quietly entertaining.  Classy.  Simply wonderful.","1521":"We went to The Parish to celebrate a birthday. The food was really good and a good value for the price. The portions were large enough that several of us shared dishes & had plenty to eat. The fish & chips, ruby red trout were excellent. Warning: if you don't like anything spicy, be careful what you order, but if you like a little heat, there are many tasty choices.","1522":"An amazing place to have drinks, appetizers and dinner.  We have been coming here for years.  The craft cocktails are very good, our favorites are the Mule, front porch tea, and sazerac cant be beat.\nWe really enjoy the oysters blue, crawfish hushpuppies, and we just tried the goat cheese relleno . Absolutely amazing!  Most times we do appetizers and drinks, but the meals are just as amazing.  My favorite is the shrimp and grits.  \nUsed to love the unique bread pudding, but they changed recipe a while back and now it's not very good. My wife and I met in Louisiana back in the early 80s and we love Cajun food.  The parish has a wonderful menu and twist in Cajun food that won't leave you disappointed!!!","1523":"Oh My goodness!!!!\nI'm a foodie and I've eaten at 25 or more DDD restaurants. I Love food and according to my wife maybe a little to much.  I lived in Tucson nearly 8 years and I've tried 100s of eateries from Nogales to Phoenix.  La Piazza in Phoenix is my favorite Italian restaurant but this place is the best food in AZ bar none. It is a little pricey and the live blues was a tad loud but holy smokes the food was amazing and in coming back tomorrow.  I had\nAlabama Quail\n\nPan seared then oven roasted, stuffed with shrimp, andouille and mushroom cornbread stuffing; served with corn maque choux, white cheddar grit cake and topped with Carolina gold sauce\n\nNo wonder this place won Iron Chef Tucson. Go Now! Don't wait.... if you're in Phoenix I highly recommend LA Piazza but if you're in America I definitely encourage you to come try their food.  My friend \/ co-worker was equally impressed.","1524":"I love this place! I have been here only 5 times or so and it's amazing.  Most recent visit, we had the PEI mussels, Alabama quail, and BBQ Pork Adobo sandwich.  I enjoy trying a different unique cocktail each visit.  Only con is not enough local beer selection IMO.","1525":"I'll get my only complaint about this place out of the way first: location. You see, their delicious cocktails and incredible bar service are so good that you just want to stay and drink a whole bunch. Since Parish is a northwest haunt and I live downtown, you can imagine what the cab fare would be.\n\nNever the less, I've visited Parish twice more since my initial trip and I will say, as a professional drinker, the cab fare is worth it.\n\nYou would think, at a Southern-style gastropub, trying to find a vegetarian option would gain you only raised eyebrows and a crappy salad. Instead, you get an understanding smile and a \"don't worry, the chef has you covered.\" When they say \"covered\", they mean that he will cook you something so delicious that you will actually lamet its absence once you've finished it.\n\nThe service is tip-top, the drinks are SO GOOD and the food will make you want to eat until they have to roll you out the door to your car at closing time.","1526":"A great hidden gem.  Food is fantastic, the service is fantastic!!  They have live music on the weekends.  I live this resturant.  Wish we would have found it sooner","1527":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tucson. I highly recommend their N.Y. strip salad. I liked it so much the first time I had it. I had to bring my boyfriend back so he could try it too. I like their drunken angel as well. We'll definitely come back again.","1528":"Fabulous for any foodie. We've been meaning to come since it opened, but just didn't get around to it. Must say I certainly regret that. The food was absolutely fantastic. Unique dishes and very very fresh, flavorful and just plain delicious. We had the mussels and bacon popcorn to start. Both fabulous. I've had mussels in some of the best Scandinavian restaurants... literally... and these were right up there. The unique slightly spicy sauce  kicked them up just a notch from the usual white wine and butter sauce! The popcorn definitely a winner as well. Three of us had the Fish and Chips, my first round was slightly undercooked, but they were quick to replace it with a freshly prepared plate cooked perfectly. Very light, crisp and worth the wait. The fries by the way are awesome. I'm guessing freshly hand-cut. The service was friendly and gracious, and we will absolutely be back. I rank this a must if you're in Northwest Tucson.","1529":"Went to Rat's for our anniversary last Friday. Stopped by the bar\/lounge for a couple of drinks before we dined...very cozy and inviting. Went into the dining room and were seated near the fireplace...quite romantic. Food was very good and the pour on the wine was quite generous. Dessert is where the issue came in. My wife ordered a chocolate torte that came with a mascarpone cream and rosemary poached peaches. Dessert came out and she loved the way the torte tasted. As she starts eating the fruit I commented that they don't look like peaches. She tasted it and said no they don't. We questioned the waitress and she went to the kitchen to inquire. When she came back she said the chef changed it and made it with pluots. We are a family that deals with many food allergies, some that are deathly. In this case my wife is not allergic to pluots, plums or apricots, but that is not the problem. The problem is that you are paying hard earned money to get what you are expecting and not to possibly be put in a dangerous situation. To their credit Rat's does list whether or not items are gluten free and they are quite descriptive as to what is in a dish. But if the chef is going to change a dish, the customer should be made aware before it is presented to the table and eaten. My wife was never asked if she wanted something else after being told and not asked if it was okay that it was made with pluots. It came across more of an oh, well type of situation and we were given the excuse \"the chef never told us.\"","1530":"I'm so excited I finally got the chance to dine here. I'm a member at the gardens and have been here for drinks but never eaten here. \n\nWhat a fantastic experience! We had the mezza appetizer, split the seafood salad, had mussels and the quiche as entrees all with a bottle of ros\u00e9. We finished the meal with the strawberry-rhubarb and the coconut rice pudding desserts. The food was all delicious (only small comment was that the quiche needed a little salt.) \n\nThe real standout of the experience was the service. Yes, it's a slowly paced meal which is wonderful when you're enjoying the atmosphere and company. The best part was our server, Rachel. She was an absolute sweetheart - helpful and attentive. We told her  we were having a special mother's day\/ birthday meal for my mom and when she brought out the desserts, they had done a little birthday surprise for my mom. It was really fantastic. This will definitely be a place I return for special occasions.","1531":"great place to stop in for a drink or comfort food.Salads available,as are mixed drinks and beer on tap.try it,can't go too far wrong. ...","1532":"Do not pass on this place. The best gumbo I've ever had outside of new Orleans. Nice bar and service with a smile. A slice of Cajun heaven.","1533":"Visiting Grounds for Sculpture is always enjoyable.  We planned a trip and made reservations at Rats for lunch.   The spectacular landscaping approaching the building and its unique entry foyer feels like you are entering a magical place.  We sat in a very nice room with a large window overlooking a pond.   Our waiter, I believe his name is Peter, was very knowledgeable about the menu, along with  explanations of the unique drink offerings.   Peter was very attentive throughout the meal, he earns 5 stars.   The food was good,  but  the website states superb french country cuisine.  So my expectations were high ordering the artisanal cheese plate we chose as an appetizer (unexciting).  A variety of cheese was neatly laid out on a wooden board.  Nothing more, nothing less.    My french dip sandwich, again, was tasty, but no reason for high praise.   It came on nicely toasted baquette,   a side dish of gravy (it was a little thicker than au jus), and shoestring french fries.   My companions  meals -  salads, turkey croissant, and chicken and waffles (is that French?) again were just fine, but I wouldn't use the words superb french cuisine to describe them.  Very little attention to foods presentation at lunch, perhaps it is different at dinner..  I have heard high praise for Rat's Friday night happy hour, so I am looking forward to the spring\/summer months to enjoy a cocktail out on their patio.","1534":"Came on a sunday to visit GFS. THey were serving buffet brunch and lunch a la carte. Personally I don't think any buffet brunch would be worth $44 (unless it's at the Rainbow Room) so I ordered off the lunch menu. Their eggplant \"mignon\", which is an entree, sounded super creative to me so we shared it as an appetizer. The eggplant was a tad under, but the dish was still delicious. The balance of tomato, pesto and acid was on point. For my actual entree I got the seared trout. Chef could have used less oil, and the dish came with lettuce-based salad rather than frisee as listed on the menu, but I was glad the skin of the fish was very crispy (since that's what makes or breaks seafood dishes for me). My friend enjoyed her bucatini with rabbit ragout. Great decor and service. But more importantly I'm really happy to see both classic techniques and creativity in the chef's cooking. I've only been here twice in 5 years but both times my experience was marvelous.","1535":"Not sure I would say A-OK but would say OK. Seated promptly even though we were missing two of our group. Decent tap list with a nice selection of beer styles for most tastes. We ordered the bacon popcorn and cornbread as starters while waiting for the other two to arrive. The bacon popcorn was a disappointment. Greasy, way too salty as is expected for bar appetizers, and the pepper was over the top. We only ate about half of it. The cornbread was nice but small. For dinner we split the smoked salmon salad. Adequate, nothing special, but the dressing, spicy hot, was excellent. As an occasional visitor to the Tucson area, here for three weeks this time, I am not sure I will go back this year with all of the other places to try. If I lived here full time I would go back to try other items on the menu.","1536":"I actually attended a wedding here a few weeks ago, so my experience here wasn't your average sit - in dining experience.  With that being said, I was generally very pleased and impressed with Rat's.  \n\nPositives - Rat's is a very large restaurant and located on the Grounds for Sculpture.  The ambiance and environment was great for the wedding.  It was a gorgeous 60 degree day with plenty of sunshine and I was very impressed with facilities both inside and out.  The grounds provided an incredibly ideal setting for a wedding and the water and various sculptures offered a pretty classy, yet whimsical backdrop to the festivities.  \nNow let me get to the food.  The hor d'oeuvres served after the ceremony were plentiful and very delicious.  My personal favorites were the lobster mac n cheese, and the cheesesteak rolls.  The dinner menu consisted of a house - style salad with candied walnuts, lobster bisque and my entree of a grilled fillet mignon, brussel sprouts and a celery root puree.  The salad was just ok to me.  Nothing out of this world, but the candied walnuts offered a good contrast with the greens and went nicely with the blue cheese.  The lobster bisque was outstanding in my opinion.  The soup was very, very flavorful.  I could taste the tomato, thyme, and saffron combined with the flavor of lobster.  There were also several large chunks of lobster meat throughout, which were just great.  My fillet was closer to a medium, and I generally prefer a medium-rare, so I had to deduct points for that.  However, it was a large fillet and seasoned very nicely.  The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked and together with the celery root puree, accompanied the fillet very, very well.  For deserts, we had various different homemade pies along with hor d'oeuvre - style deserts like various fruit tarts, cheesecakes, macaroons, fresh fruits, mini-pies, and many other items that I just can't recall.  However, I thought the deserts were outstanding presented very nicely.  \nLastly, I was extremely impressed with the service and how polite and affable the staff was.  Maybe since it was a wedding, they turned up the customer service a bit, or maybe it's a general practice, regardless of the event.  The staff really went out of their way to make sure everyone was taken care of and in a very polite and attentive but not overbearing in the least either. \n\nNegatives - Not many based on my experience, to be honest with you.  I had some very minor gripes about my salad and fillet not being exactly to my liking, but in the grand scheme of things, they were very minor.  \n\nI wish I could give Rat's 4 1\/2 stars, instead of just 4.  My experience there was pretty much outstanding and I would absolutely recommend it.","1537":"My boyfriend was the one that hears about this place so we tried to for lunch. First impression was that i was small and pretty unique with the pictures on the wall\nThe food was okay, im a picky eater so it was hard for me to find somethibg to eat. Justin got the hotdog and loved it and i got a burger which i had to ask for fries as a side after cause the coslaw was spicy. We will go back for dinner cause there are a couple things we want to try.","1538":"I really do love this place...we have gone a handful of times. We recently hosted a surprise party for my father in law (20 people). service is always good and food is amazing ..a major complaint i do have however is they have changed the menu AT ALL. they have added a brunch option, but it's the same...time for an update.","1539":"After pouring through Yelp reviews of local Tucson restaurants I decided to take a business associate to The Parish. I always look for interesting local places that have good food and local beer. This place was hopping for a Tuesday evening but they fit us in. It was a great atmosphere with a friendly staff. We both enjoyed the Gumbo and an order of the hand cut fries.\nThe beer was good and the service was friendly. \nI definitely recommend this cool place to fellow travelers.","1540":"Love this place, service was impeccable.\n\nPersonally I'm not crazy for blue cheese on my burger.\n\nNice place to take your date","1541":"Absolutely delicious food!!! Great customer service! I think I've recommended this place to absolutely anyone I know. The chefs are so attentive to detail and quality. I never feel disappointed when we go there!!!","1542":"This is the kind of place you go to once a year for a big occasion.  Food is fabulous, ambiance is spectacular, service is spectacular and the prices are very pricey.  Of course you get what you pay for.  You will not be disappointed and your guest will be very impressed.  Nothing bad to say about this place, I love it.  Wish I could afford to go more often!  I have no idea how this place survives in the Trenton area?","1543":"Nice looking place, and the garden more a place to go for the view than the food. \n \nVery small portions \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise. \n\nI was appreciative the most of the visit improvised of a very nice guy, on his golf cart through the entire huge garden plus bonus : comments of each sculptures. \n\nIdyllic spot if you try hard to impress your sheila, chick, woman whatever.","1544":"People rating this restaurant a little lower than average didn't quite seem to make sense to me as I just went there a couple days ago for dinner and had an above average experience. \n\nI sat outside where the heaters kept the semi chilly weather at bay and with the excellent scenario out there... The setting, overall mood just had things set up for a great time. \n\nOur server was Andrew, who was professional and knowledgable about the menu.\n\nOrdering an appetizer, two cocktails and two entree definitely put us at the close 100.00 dollar range overall for the bill.... Which everything tasted delicious but as a big Korean who loves to eat, it was filling but the entree has that fancy pants presentation where you just get a thumb of food when you want a whole handful... But that's just my inner fat boy screaming for some more good tasting food. \n\nPros: \n- ambience, great outside view\n- overall great friendly service, I really appreciated how they checked to time the entree. Was still working the appetizer and they didn't rush the entree out whatsoever. Kindly asked actually to time it right with the chef and our completion of the appetizer. \n- food was delicious 7-8 out of 10\n\nCons: \n- Portion control. 'Fine dining'. I would have wished just a bit more for what I paid. I've eaten at some fancy restaurants and paid premium price but were given like 5 course meals that definitely was worth spending the money.... For this I would have expected just a little bit more. \n- some light outside music would have been nice. Can't remember if there were any inside, but helps with not feeling too exposed to the listening in quiet engaged couple that was sitting at the table behind us,","1545":"Rat's falls short of a 4th or 5th star because service was lacking. From the beginning when we arrived the hostess greeting was lackluster. Our table was not ready although we were only 5 minutes early for our reservation. We waited much too long to be served water and bread and the overall pacing of the meal was awkward and delayed. \n\nThe meal was good but no one was overjoyed with their dish. Perhaps we were just exhausted by the time it made it to the table. We were celebrating a birthday which was passed onto the hostess; however, never passed onto our waiter. I would expect more for a restaurant to receive 4 or 5 stars. \n\nThe grounds are really beautiful and the sculpture garden a great added feature to the dining experience. Fantastic ambiance in general but not interested in returning any time soon.","1546":"The La Verdad cocktail was excellent and the Ruby Red Trout was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. I will be back!","1547":"We are travelling between North Texas and Phoenix so ended up in Tucson for the evening. Checked yelp and found the Parish. Good reviews and the menu looked great. Met at the door, service was great all around. Seated immediately, server approached within one minute of us sitting down. Took drink orders and offered help with the menu. Her recommendation to me for the Drunken Angel was accepted and the Wife had the \"crispiest\" fish and chips in the world, so the menu says.\nDrinks arrived quickly, accurately and cold. Tasted great too. Ordered the Chicharron app; fried pig skin with chili and lime. Fresh, hot chicharrons are fantastic and taste nothing like the bag you buy at the grocery store. Crispy, salty and fresh, great alone but much better with the chili and lime. Even the Wife loved them.\nHer fish and chips were very crispy, tasted great and she said the tartar sauce was the best she ever had. The hand cut fries were crispy with a soft center, the best way for any fries. My Drunken Angel was a superb dish; Burgundy angel hair pasta with shrimp and crawfish in a lobster red pepper cream sauce and fresh parmesan on top. Rich, perfectly seasoned and taste beyond normal. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Try this one, it is worth the med\/high pricing.","1548":"3.5 stars rounded up! we weren't in love with the Parish but they do have some solid dishes\n\n---la verdad cocktail: kinda acidic but pretty lacking in alcohol\n---fish n chips: nice, light, crispy crust on the fish! fries were also good\n---drunken angel pasta: love the loads of seafood in the dish but the pasta sauce had an odd taste i couldn't get over\n---gumbo: spicy sausage! comes w\/ a scoop of rice on top & corn hush puppies. i liked the hush puppies BUT the gumbo was nothing too special\n---pimpinadas: not a fan of the combination of flavors here, a play on sweet & salty with a KICK of spicy\n---goat cheese relleno: a nice appetizer, but not an easy one to share \n---pecan smoked ruby red trout: comes w\/ candied pecans, carmelized onions, roasted garlic, & toast...the trout was just ok but i liked the onions & pecans!\n\nOur server was really nice & let us have a big private room for our friend's bday even though there were only 5 of us\n\nNOTE: no cake cutting fee, SCORE!","1549":"Larkellen is the definition of boutique!  Tucked away in the Arlington Gardens Mall, this adorable little shop has a variety of specialty items that you don't even know that you need\/want.  The shop is family run and the owner, Meme, has a great style and flair that is clearly the inspiration behind the store.  If you are looking for a wedding or hostess gift, this would be the perfect spot to come.  Inside they have kitchen and home goods items, including inspirational hand towels, gourmet gluten-free cookie mixes, and super sleek ice cream scoops.  You can also find some clothing and accessory items such as snarky t-shirts, jewelry, beautiful leather wallets, and funky boots.  For the men in your lives, they have some shaving essentials, cool watches, and really unique barware.  Meme was very proud to show me around her store and gave me an explanation of how they work hard to stock as many fair trade, local items as possible, and if not local, at least small batch, made in the USA.  Awesome!  I ended up buying myself a new wallet\/clutch as I couldn't resist walking out of this adorable new store without a little treat for myself.  The selection is limited and the prices are on the higher side, but the quality and uniqueness is certainly there!  I will be back for gifts (and hopefully avoid indulging in more presents for myself).","1550":"We had a party of 8 and made reservations for 7:00 pm last Sunday. We had the private room to handle our rowdy family. Our waiter was so awesome, funny, and extremely accommodating. He gave great recommendations and made sure we all had a good time. The only thing I could recommend is that we didn't get refills on our drinks unless pulling another waiter aside and asking them to help us. But other than that, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is awesome! Live music, great food and drinks. If you don't drink alcohol, I would recommend the Cranberry Mule.","1551":"Great food and beverages. In addition to cocktails a nice variety of specialty non alcoholic beverages. Lovely atmosphere and phenomenal service!Took my mother there for brunch last summer while touring the grounds.  A very nice way to spend a special day.","1552":"Great setting, food was pretty good but the service was super slow. I would only recommend it to people who like a very leisurely lunch. My dish the roasted chicken was wonderful but my sister was very disappointed by her leek tart. Weak three stars, the setting and ambiance boost it.","1553":"When craving gumbo and hushpuppies, this is the place my wife and I go.  This time my wife and I also tried the bacon & eggs appetizer.  It's made with braised pork belly, a cheese grit cake, hollandaise and a tasty mustard sauce.  We both loved it.  In fact, my wife said that next time she would eat it for dinner.  The atmosphere is intimate and stylish and a great place to enjoy a cocktail or a cold Abita on draft.","1554":"Great food, excellent atmosphere!! Comfy place for casual dining, visiting, having a drink or sharing munchies!","1555":"Dropped in here after reading the reviews while on business. I ended up going back 3 more times in a week! The bar had fantastic drinks. The food was super and it had a laid back vibe that worked for me after a day at work!","1556":"I went to Rat's for my brother and his fiance's engagement party.  We called ahead for a reservation on the chef's table off the kitchen for a lunch.   The restaurant and kitchen were beautiful.  There is tile all throughout the kitchen on the walls that was very nice to look at while eating our meal.  Our party had many people with food allergies \/ dietary restrictions and our server was excellent in accommodating this.  He OVER explained every dish so everyone would have an idea of what was in it down to the type of broth used to make a soup.  \n\nFor food we ate almost the entire lunch menu.  The proven\u00e7al mezze plate was probably our groups favorite dish.  Everything on it was delicious.  I thought overall the kitchen was a little heavy handed with their salt but it was not to the point where we could not eat it.  I had the omelette for my main entree and it was definitely forgettable.\n\nOverall, a very lovely experience on the intimate chef's table for a special event.","1557":"Service was excellent, snacks were good, did not mess up dessert. But if you cannot cook duck please do not call yourself a good restaurant. Duck breast was one piece and now I know why-- they probably cut bigger portion and cut in in half. Whatever was done was not good. Chewy. I could barely cut into that piece! I am sorry, but there are better places to visit at the end of the day.","1558":"I moved to NJ from California and have been searching for a restaurant like this since I got here (I know they're around, it's just difficult finding the right places when you're unfamiliar with an area). Rats serves fresh and local ingredients, the food was imaginative and flavors were well paired, and the outdoor ambiance was amazing. \n\nI see this restaurant is marked as being expensive, but I found the lunch menu very fair (I paid $16 for a large dish of mussels that I thought the owners could have sold for $30). \n\nIn addition to this nice business model, I had a very friendly waiter who was attentive (but not overbearing) and helpful. \n\nI will be looking for more excuses to make my way here again in the future!","1559":"Delicious! Everything was fabulous! Service, hush puppies- AMAZING! Drunken noodles -Oh my gosh, thinking about going back now. Enjoy this gem!","1560":"Lived around the corner from this place for years but never wandered in until a friend highly recommended. SO glad we did! Everything we ordered was super delicious and service was great. Will go back for the baked oysters bleu and drunken angel pasta. #Yumalert","1561":"Holy radtastic pretzel ball like pieces of heaven! Delish! Seriously. The staff is super friendly. We stopped into this little pub for an after work cocktail and I loved everything about it. The bartender was a total riot and the vodka well...it was vodka so nothing special there. (Kind of hard to screw up a vodka soda-although some have managed to do so here and there) We got a little snack and we were happy campers. I'll be a repeat offender in the very near future.","1562":"Pretty darn good place.  I got the burger but when push comes to shove I'd rather have Zinburger for that.  All in all they're doing things right here.","1563":"AMAZING Risotto... obviously. It is a french restaurant. Our waiter is also wonderful. I wish I remembered his name but we were seated upstairs inside a cute room with around 3 tables. There are a lot of butter and bread options. It was too good not to have! We  ordered the chicken and steak and had a side of risotto. \n\nOverall, great service and fantastic food. We were STUFFED by dessert time but the waiter still brought us samples... I wish we were not full!\n\nDefinitely go for a special occasion since it's work the price.","1564":"Never felt blatant racism until I stepped foot into this establishment. The staff did not even acknowledge my family's presence and completely ignored us. My family and I felt so uncomfortable we left. Good thing I did not give them my money.","1565":"I've heard great reviews of this place and had never been. We came for dinner with some out-of-town friends late on a Sunday night. I thought the service was really excellent. Our server was animated and knew a lot about the restaurant and the menu. I didn't imbibe, but their cocktails looked great. Two people in my party ordered a parishioner and a well water, and I tried them both. I liked the well water quite a bit, but the parishioner was just okay. It looked like they had decent wine and beer offerings as well.\n\nWe got the PEI mussels and frog legs to start. I had never tried frog legs before; they really are kinda like chicken! These were wrapped in bacon and very juicy. The portion was very small; there were only four on the plate. The mussels were good and came with fennel and chorizo. Both appetizers were good, but you can spend a lot here if you're ordering apps and drinks with your dinner.\n\nI ordered the gumbo, and it was rich and savory. I should've taken the server up on his offer to add some seafood though (it was made with chicken and andouille). It came with four hush puppies, which were crispy and tasty. I tried my boyfriend's drunken angel pasta. It was really good, but super rich. I don't think I could finish the whole dish if I got that.\n\nThe portions were nicely sized; one friend ordered the Tchoup, and it was HUGE. All the food was very rich, but I think that comes with the creole style. This place is inventive and one-of-a-kind. It isn't a place I'd go all the time; you have to be in the mood for it, but I would definitely return for a special dinner.","1566":"We are no strangers to fine dining.  We've explored many of the options in central jersey, and other than a few shining stars, we are usually left feeling \"meh\".  \n\nRat's is certainly a shining star.  The staff was exceptional and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  From the amuse bouche to the petit fours, each bite was well crafted.  I had requested a romantic table, and we were seated in a more private nook of the restaurant.  The drinks were creative, our entrees (mussells fritte and the filet) were both soooo good.  And the popovers!  Oh those popovers.  I will dream about them.  I'd return JUST for the popovers.  I can't imagine why anyone would give this place a less than stellar review.  Most surprisingly, compared to other restaurants we visit for special occasions in Princeton, this meal was a steal!  We will most certainly be going back.","1567":"Well it was the grand opening and the place was packed. The staff was definitely going to be challenged with standing room only. They pulled it off. It looked like it would be impossible, but they did it. The food was fun and delicious! we had the edamame and bacon popcorn for appetizers and an order of the \"PIT\" wings. The popcorn is a perfect snack with beer. You could just go sit at the bar and have a beer and popcorn with friends. It was good. Maybe at some point give it out like a mexican restaurant gives out chips and salsa at the table? I see no need to really charge for them and it would be a nice part of the night out to look forward to. Anyway, The edamame were just right \"my daughter loved them\" and I have to say the \"Pit\" wings were the best wings I've EVER had!!! Ever, ever and oh yes ever! Damn brilliant. For main course my wife and daughter split a Parish Burger. The mix of flavors with the charred burger were balanced and fun. I had the the blackened steak salad. The presentation was unusual and fun to eat. I like to be surprised at at a restaurant for dinner. I think we all like a little fun way the food is served. The Roma lettuce was served in whole pieces stacked on top of each other length wise \"Like an upside down lettuce boat\" along the plate with the anchovy vinaigrette drizzled over the top with fresh Parmesan. The Roma tomatoes and red onion were sliced on the side. The steak was sliced into little medallions on the side as well. It was fun to cut into that upside down lettuce boat. It also helped to keep the presentation \"neat\" and organized on your plate. Not like a messy pile of cut up salad. Crunchy and the dressing was stellar. The steak had a spicy sweet flavor. Like allspice, garlic and brown sugar with a kick. Really different. Now about the service. The biggest surprise of the night was our server. She was awesome!! I don't know how she kept the chaos out of her mind and perform like she did. A lesser server would crumble under the pressure. Well done!","1568":"First of all, if you find yourself in Tucson you should do yourself a favor and check out The Parish. Secondly, if you're debating in between the chop and the steak then I would definitely recommend the steak...but be forewarned, that sh*t is richer than Donald Trump married to Michael Jackson's entire family. Also, I'm pretty sure they harvested the whole of Idaho to make the layer of fries beneath the steak. \n\nTalk to the bartender Nathan for some excellent service. Transmission terminated.","1569":"One of the coolest places I've eaten\/drank at in Tucson!  Atmosphere is incredible - Friday nights they have live music!  The service is awesome! Try the french fries and the popcorn!","1570":"Here's how I see it.  If a restaurant is going to charge an average of $40 per plate for the main course, the stakes really have to be higher and Rats just doesn't meet them.. Had the prices been significantly lower, the ratings would be higher, because the food is good but just not worth the price tag.  Also, the service we experienced was spotty, which again, would not have been an issue for me at your average-priced place, but not really acceptable at an upscale restaurant.   We started with the pork belly appetizer, which was good.  We also had the 3 cheese plate.  It came with 3 small crackers for the three pieces of cheese.  Uhm.. there are two people, three pieces of cheese, so just the most basic math and common sense would probably call for six crackers (that's a bare minimum, because I don't like to shove a huge piece of cheese into my mouth and would rather have just a little bit at a time) so each of us could have at least one piece of cracker for each cheese to taste.  Well, after we went through the 3 crackers meant for both of us and still had half of the cheese, we asked for more crackers.  The waiter said \"How about some popovers?\"  Uhm.. no, we'd rather have crackers but I guess so..  They never came.  Everyone around us was being served the complimentary popovers but not us.  Then our entrees come out.  We are still waiting for something to eat the cheese with!  Ok, we begin to eat our entrees, since fish can't really sit for too long.  It was very hot out and the cheese began to lose its appeal fast just sitting there.  Finally, we get our waiters attention and he comes back with slices of baguette.  No popovers for us, they ran out..   At this point, the cheese was so soft that I could spread it like butter on the baguette.  So clearly, the timing and service was way off and really prevented us from properly enjoying our meal.  I will say that in the end, the cheese appetizer was deducted from our bill after we mentioned what happened to the manager who was walking around and checking on costumers.  \nLater,  We had the chocolate tort for dessert and again, totally mediocre for a $12 price tag.  It looked and tasted like a dry brownie.  Would I have been disappointed if it was 6 or 7 bucks, no.  But, as what I have been saying all along, the restaurant has to understand that the expectations will be higher with the high price tags. We want interesting and amazing flavors but we get just ok instead.   I would recommend this place if you want a beautiful scenery but just keep your expectations of the food low.","1571":"Quirky comes to mind. But then, it is on Seward Johnson's Grounds for Sculpture.   \n\nIt's an unexpected and unique find so don't let the Disneyesque vision of Monet's Lily Pond fool you.  Authentic French Proven\u00e7al offerings served up by an attentive and professional staff make this a great place to linger and have a long, lazy lunch.  \n\nThe interiors are a little to kitschy for me but we were lucky enough to sit outside near the pond.  Weather permitting, I strongly recommend dining al fresco.  \n\nPlan ahead and make a reservation, particularly on weekends.  Make it a great day and throw in a walk though the sculpture gardens - you'll be glad you did!","1572":"Ate there for the first time on April 13 for my birthday. My sister and I loved it. The best part was being able to eat oysters on the half shell in Tucson!!!\nRolling Stones was playing all night and that is my favorite band....another plus.\nThe service was awesome and we will definitely go back again.\nNice to have a New Orleans style place to eat in AZ.","1573":"Dined here for the first time last night and everything about the meal and experience was excellent.\n\nThe elegant ambiance cannot be beat.  We were seated outside on a beautiful evening, and you felt as if you were sitting in the middle of Monet's painting of a footbridge over lily pond. You feel transported to a completely different world, never knowing you are in NJ. \n\nThe menu changes weekly and every bite was fantastic.  Dinner started off with an amuse-bouche compliments of the chef, and it set the tone for the rest of dinner. We started with sharing the Mezze platter and the Leek Tartlet.  For dinner the Caramelized Scallops were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth.  The Salmon was moist with a lovely, crisp skin. As a side we shared the Pea and Mushroom Risotto and it was probably the best I have ever tasted.  After sharing a small dessert, we were also presented with a complimentary tasting of chef's selection of sweets. Being a French restaurant I expected the servings to be a little smaller than they were, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The service was professional, attentive, friendly and top notch.  \n\nAfter dinner we took a brief walk around the Grounds for Sculpture.  It was fairly late by the time we were able to explore, so unfortunately we were only able to walk a small portion of the grounds.  Because it was so late and had started to get dark, it was completely private and as if it was our own secret garden.  At every turn there was something different to see; another surprise.  The gardens, the sculptures.....simply stunning.  I am looking forward to a future visit and getting lost for hours.","1574":"Service was great!  The ambience is really nice, upscale but with a grounded vibe.\n\nSadly not too many vegetarian options, but the few they did have were delicious!  \n\nOrdered the mezze for appetizer, and everything was perfectly flavored.  The lavash (I think that's what it is called) bread was a hit!  The herbed butter to go with bread makes you want to take a bath in it, the flavors were so fresh, oh man!  \n\nFor dinner we had the coq qo vin, loved it!  Large portion too!  The potato leek ravioli was delish, portion size was a little on the weak side.  The creamy polenta was flavorful, but the ratio of polenta to everything else was off, very little polenta if that was supposed to be the main attraction.  \n\nDessert we shared the coconut panna cotta was ok,  wasn't too impressed sadly.  The cake and panna cotta were two different elements that did not really flow as one grand dessert in my opinion, but I'm individually they tasted fine.  \n\nOverall, I'd visit again since their menu is seasonal and changes often from what the waitress indicated.","1575":"Strolled in and asked for a table for two. Got told in the snotty way it would be 45 minutes.  5 minutes later I get a call saying my table was ready. On our way through the restaurant half the tables were empty. Oh well, given their prices I see why they try to pull off the city attitude.  \n\nIf you can sit outside and enjoy the Monet themed pond \n\nThat said the cheese board was well selected. The crispy shrimp salad was fresh with washed greens and a slightly too sweet dressing was satisfactory.  Waiter gave his speech about locally sourced etc but ignored me when i asked if anything was organic or GMO free. \n\nBetter than the 3 other caf\u00e9s I walked by and while a little overpriced it is what you would expect of a restaurant attached to a sculpture garden.  \n\nWould have given them 3 stars but both soap dispensers in the ladies room were not dispensing soap.  Makes me wonder how the female servers were easing their hands. TG I has male servers and a desperate need to believe the soap was working in their bathrooms before the prepared and served my food.","1576":"I had the Drunken Angel for dinner. It is a pasta dish with a creamy crawfish sauce.....ummmm...so good!","1577":"I've been reading about the Parish for awhile. Other reviewers were right about the burgers....ours was yummy. Nicely seasoned, properly cooked. Fries were very good too. I tried the pretzel bites and wasn't impressed. They were just salted bread and the sauce was too hot for me. However, the chocolate chip bread pudding was yummy. The best thing was a great selection of beers.  Also the service was friendly and we never wanted for anything.","1578":"Only 3.5 starts!? Seriously. Wow. Not cool.\n\nThis food was absolutely delicious and was straight out of a painting. Menu is seasonal so I won't even bother sharing what I ordered. I was thoroughly impressed.","1579":"I've been here twice: once for a happy hour and once for dinner. Both times I've been very impressed by the drink selection and quality, as well as the food quality. Portions are a little smaller than I'd like them to be, for the price, and the parking lot SUCKS.\n\nMy first time there was for happy hour. I shared some bacon popcorn with my table and ordered a beer. The server was very knowledgable about the beer menu and made a few suggestions, then a recommendation based on my feedback. She offered to bring out tastes of a few things, but since she took a while to come over I didn't want to wait for a drink; either way, I was happy with her blind recommendation. We sat on the patio and it was noisy, but this was early enough in the year when it was cool enough to be comfortable. The patio is small and faces Oracle Road, so I would recommend sitting inside.\n\nThe second time I went was to meet my parents for dinner. The host was pleasant and accommodated my father's super-specific table requirements with good humor. Our server was extremely helpful with the menu and had tried pretty much every single thing on the drink menu and the food menu. My mom had something with salmon, my dad had something steak-y, and I had the Smokin' Angel pasta, which I asked the server to make spicy. He verified the level of spiciness, and when it came out it was INCREDIBLE. It was a smoky dark reddish sauce over angel hair, with fresh jalapenos (at my request--normally they aren't in there) and chicken, and perhaps some vegetables. It came with a piece or two of crunchy, yummy garlic bread. My mom and I drank some fancy cocktails (this was my only complaint about the server--he told me something wasn't sweet, but it came out cloying) and my dad had beer. All in all, it was a very nice dinner experience.\n\nThey had some amazing-looking dessert specials--some sort of homemade bread pudding and some homemade ice cream--but we were so full that we didn't try anything. It is definitely on my agenda for future dining experiences!\n\nThe interior is nice--tastefully decorated (and there MIGHT be local art on the walls, but I can't remember for sure) and the bathrooms were clean and also nicely done. I don't care for the layout of the tables, which somehow feel like they're on a giant merry-go-round, but at least they aren't so close together that you hear your neighbors' entire conversation as you imagine yourself spinning around the room. The bar is huge and looks like a nice place to sit.\n\nI'll definitely be back here! I'm excited to try some other stuff on the menu.","1580":"Really enjoyed the food.  There was live New Orleans Jazz music on the night we went and there isn't a bad thing on the menu.  Huge cocktail and beer selection.","1581":"We decided to try The Parish for our anniversary dinner. I'm a Southerner and there were a few things on the menu I was looking forward to trying. \n\nWe started off with a bowl of boiled peanuts. Boiled peanuts are, without a doubt my weakness in life and being from South Carolina I am a connoisseur. While listed online, the peanuts weren't on the menu when we arrived at the restaurant. We asked about them and were told they were available so we ordered a bowl to share. It's January and Arizona so I was mildly interested in how they do boiled peanuts as we don't have access to green peanuts out here anytime and green peanuts are out of season everywhere right now. When the peanuts arrived they were hot but the chef had thrown a handful of cayenne pepper on them. Mind, they weren't spicy in the shell, just pepper on top of the shells. OK. At any rate, they were just OK. They weren't nearly salty enough for my taste and nearly any roadside peanut stand in the South would top them. \n\nNext up we ordered the Crawfish Hushpuppies. Our server kindly took a special order to delete the crawfish meat. They were pretty good, although the sweetness from the sugar in the batter was a bit of a shock. \n\nThe Cornbread was fabulous. A sweet cornbread made with blue cornmeal and served with a bourbon butter it was probably my favorite part of the meal. The cornbread was moist and delicious and the hint of cinnamon was extraordinary!\n\nFor the entree we had the Drunken Angel with fries instead of collard greens. The dish was wonderful and the portions very good. The fries were good and hot.\n\nThe service was fabulous. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and accommodating to our needs. He was quick and efficient and very personable.","1582":"Appetizer : Brie tartelette\nFantastic smoke baked and crusty - julienne apple. Fantastic   Finished with toasted hazelnuts sweet cmetelized onion \n\nScallops were single sided seared only but heated through and properly served. \n\nPopover as always very good - new garlic butter recipe or at least very well executed\n\nOverall great place to go.","1583":"Not sure what happened here...made a reservation weeks ago and they tried to stick us in a small stark wine room. No space in the beautiful restaurant I booked, ended up in the noisy bar with way too many people bumping into our table and standing right over us. Honestly the food was the worst part, mostly cold and poorly plated. Not high-end service or even close. Manager tried to make it right with a free drink but no level of BOL could have fixed this.","1584":"I just had my birthday dinner here this past Friday and all I can say is WOW! I have loved this restaurant ever since I tried it back in March. My boyfriend said it might not be the best place for a birthday dinner since the restaurant is quite small but it ended up being a great night. Our waiter was Mike and he did a phenomenal job. He was very attentive, gave my friends samples of drinks if they were not sure if they would like something, and just an overall friendly guy. \n\nI really do not know why this place does not get 5 stars from everyone. The amount of places in Tucson with flavorful food is very limited and The Parish has the most flavorful food I have had in a long time. The Fish and Chips is definitely my favorite with white truffle aioli for the french fries. My friends also enjoyed the gumbo, hush puppies and the burgers. \n\nAll in all I love this place!! Thank you parish for making my birthday dinner so much fun and filled with amazingly yummy food.","1585":"We stopped in for cocktails based on the recommendation from a bartender at La Cocina.  I tried the blueberry thyme rickey and really enjoyed this well made cocktail.  Nice atmosphere, friendly bartenders and an extensive Southern inspired menu, if that's your thing.  I'm sure the food is tasty, but not as healthy of an option as we were looking for.","1586":"It's been a while since I've been here, but good to know it's just as amazing as the first time. I love that their food is consistent. I ordered the fish and chips. Amazing. The fish is lightly battered, perfectly fried, the fish inside is white flaky and moist. The fries are always crispy and neither were greasy. Had my lunch with a Beautiful fragrant 2015 Malbec. Great service as always too! Live, love and eat well","1587":"Ate here for the first time last week.  I didn't even realize this restaurant was there but so glad we found it.  They have great brews on tap that I enjoyed.  For appetizers we had the bacon popcorn and the hush puppies.  Man, both are very very good!!  For dinner my wife had some pasta which was kind of smoky tasting and I had the fish n chips.  Both were very good!  Service was great.  Food was great.  Atmosphere is chill and not too snooty which I like!!  I'll definitely be back for happy hour beers and some more of that bacon popcorn!!","1588":"We were looking forward to another great lunch at one of favorite venues. Sitting outside by the pond. Ordered the charcuterie which was great but then things went south. My wife ordered the PEI mussels which were not edible and we sent them back in exchange for the onion soup which likewise was mediocre. We were told that the chef had retired and the sous chef was now heading the kitchen. This was our fourth visit in the last year but I doubt that there will be a fifth. Very disappointed. On the bright side the waitstaff was excellent as always sorry that the fare was not.","1589":"Most of the other reviews are pretty spot on. I feel like the appetizer menu had tons of interesting\/yummy food: the bacon popcorn (popcorn with bacon grease and bits of bacon I think) was good and the goat cheese rellano was awesome.\nThe cocktail menu was also pretty good and full of some interesting choices. I had the front porch tea, which was sweet and not alcoholic tasting (so dangerous!)\nFor dinner I had shrimp and grits. Ok, but not what I was expecting. My husband got the pork chop - which was HUGE! Easily enough for 3 people. \nI would try this place again but perhaps just for appetizers and cocktails.","1590":"Their bacon popcorn and fish and chips and drinks were way amazing - I can recommend this place for anyone!  For dinner, Sunday brunch was a whole different story - it was just too much, too sweet, too spicy, too bad because it would have been nice to have a new breakfast place.   \n\nGo for lunch, dinner, drinks but skip the breakfast unless you read the menu first and are really really sure about your choice.","1591":"I've heard nothing but good things about The Parish and it didn't disappoint!  The Drunken Angel was one of the best (if not the best) pasta dishes I have ever eaten. My partner started with the Pecan Smoked Ruby Red Trout appetizer and followed with the Scallop Special of the day. He enjoyed both immensely.  His only regret was being too full to finish his entree. We will definitely make a return visit to this gem of a restaurant.","1592":"I was a little concerned about making a res here after I saw all the comments about inferior service. Especially after my emails and phone calls to the GM went unanswered. Our VP's emails and calls went unanswered as well.\n\nHowever it was the requested by the guest of honor to dine here.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early and walked around the patio area and took a few pics by some of the sculptures. Its a really nice location. Plan to walk around.\n\nAll four of us agreed to try the tasting menu  70.00 per person\n\nConsisted of a very nice seared scallop and shrimp app\nA salad with crabmeat over dressed spinach and pickled onions - just ok\nA Kobe beef (loin cut) done perfectly\nA Cheese offering  - was nice\nAnd a creme brulee for dessert - they best I ever had\n\nWe also ordered an additional app - the octopus grilled - nice smoke flavor\n\nThe service was great so no worries there that night.\n\nChef came by to say hello and wish the guest of honor well. They brought out a candle with dessert and wrote congratulations on her plate. Nice touch.\n\nThis is a nice place to have a special night - Men should wear a jacket","1593":"This place is a must in Tucson!! The drinks are tasty and hand crafted. The shrimp and grits is my favorite dish, hands down!","1594":"Here for lunch. Based on what we ate it would be a 3 but I think we did not order the right items.  The burgers and sandwiches looked fabulous as they were delivered to other tables with plenty of fries. We ordered the house salad with the lemon bleu cheese dressing. It was fabulous and the dressing was superb- very bright and tart!\n\nThe gumbo was disappointing and bland for a southern gastro-pub. It was thick with a dark rue base, minimal okra, shredded chicken and some andouille sausage but it really need something. Apparently shrimp and crawfish can be added. I ended up adding a lot of hot sauce to get the kick I was looking for.  I appreciated that I could substitute the salad for the hush puppies. \n\nI will give it a second try. Price was very good, ironically I sent the bill back because I thought it was too low and that they had forgotten a meal. Waitress was wonderful.","1595":"We went to Rat's for Valentine's Day and it was so disappointing! We have been here before and the drinks were good and the food was good (a little over-priced, but good). We came this Valentine's Day and it was a complete disaster. We waited over an hour for our reservation. The hostess told us to wait at the bar. While at the bar, we purchased drinks....then AFTER that the manager came around with free champagne, because there was a giant crowd all waiting for their tables. We told her we had already paid for our drinks and she assured us that we would get complimentary beverages at the table. So, I order a few more drinks at the table (which I would not have done if not told they would be complimentary)....guess what? We were charged for them - and they were not good. \n\nThey completely screwed up the menu options. Anything on their limited menu, we were told was coming out in approximately 2 hours so we went with the pre-fixe even though it was a lackluster and not as interesting. Also, they had already \"sold out\" of a lot of the main menu options. - Shame on you, Rat's!\n\nThe pre-fix were tiny little portions that looked like they came from the Super Bowl frozen appetizer mix from Costco, and they tasted worse! The dessert was even NASTY....I mean, how do you mess up chocolate mousse? Ask Rat's....\n\nAnyway, this was a total disaster for Valentine's Day. It was so bad it was an utter joke.","1596":"Holy F***, this place is good!  Gonna go here again.\n\nMy wife took me here for my B-Day dinner.  First we started with drinks and an order of the oysters.  I got the Dutch well water, off the chain, I absolutely love the lavender, solid ***** cocktail.  My wife got the Blueberry Thyme Rickey, she loves thyme and gives it also a solid *****.  The oysters where very fresh and clean and the smoked tomatoes cocktail sauce was surprisingly complimentary, my only complaint would be that the third oyster had broken sell bits in it, which is a big no no for fresh oysters (you could crack a tooth), therefore the oysters get ***.\n\nThen our entrees, I ordered the chicken and andouille gumbo and my wife ordered the daily special: soft shell crab over fresh made pappardelle in a cream sauce.  My wife was only kind enough to give me one bite of her soft shell crab, but oh man was it good the crab was fried perfect, the pappardelle was bouncy and the sauce was incredible, also *****.  My Gumbo was also amazing and the hush puppies that accompanied it were fried to perfection!  The gumbo is a solid *****.  I ordered a second dutch well water with my dinner and it was made less good, it was lacking in lovely lavender flavor compared to my first, but was still good, would probably only give it a *** based on that drink alone.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people and I am giving it *****, but!...  I hope the management reads this, I feel that they really need to take the oysters serious and make sure that they either properly train their peeps to shuck an oyster or just pay closer attention.  I think that oyster shell can actually crack a tooth, but either way they ruin a perfectly good oyster, no body enjoys the shell.  Also it's a bit worry some that the same cocktail would vary so much, my first was perfect and amazing while the second was just so so.\n\nI plan on returning here soon to try more dishes and another dutch well water, I'll update my review with my next visit.","1597":"It breaks my heart to write the following review but here it goes. I took my boyfriend to Rats today for his birthday - his first time but I have been several times. I called a few days in advance to book an outside table for 2.  When we got there we were sat inside... the closet table to outside but not. \nThe waiter had no problem checking out my chest but his service was a C+. I work in the serving industry so you can't fool me. I ordered a mimosa and my boyfriend ordered a sprite. A sprite and 2 waters came .. after we already had our appetizer I still haven't received my drink. I asked the waiter politely if I could have the drink I ordered. He said of course as the bar was backed up. This is not true because I saw trays of drinks come out from by other servers who were actually working. Also he visited the table several times so if the bar was backed up he should've advise they were working on the drink - mimosas are also very easy to make. It's totally cool if he forgot to ring in my drink .. it happens I get it .. but it could've been avoided if he would've been watching his section from a far and saw only a sprite and 2 waters- this would've reminded him, I ordered a drink besides water. This is serving 101. He also suggested the brunch buffet upstairs several times like he wanted to be lazy and not actually serve us- this is not why I come here. I would've loved to order more than one drink but the time I actually received the first drink I ordered I was enjoying my main course. Staying on top of my drink would've been another way for him to increase the bill amount which would've increased his tip and my experience. He also lacks with pre busing the table so when our main course came, the food runner couldn't even place it on the table. Again more laziness and not watching his section. I was really ready to give my server a nice tip being that I understand the struggle but unfortunately I was forced to only leave 20%.  I could serve circles around this man - I recommend a training course on how to watch your section, pre busing and identifying the buyer at the table. Food is incredible though! Wish I was happier with this but I'll be taking a break from this establishment.","1598":"Awesome little place with lots of good southern food and a New Orleans vibe. Great presentation and pretty imaginative menu for Tucson.\nTo start, we got the bacon popcorn (just do it, you won't regret it - it's addictive though), edamame (also great) and the frog legs (okay - a bit tough for my taste). To drink, I got the Dutch well water, which came garnished with an orchid bloom and was as tasty as it was bougie \nFor my entree, I got the drunken angel, which was fantastic. My husband got the quail, which I think he liked but wouldn't get again. Others in the party got the fish and chips (\"pretty good\") and the tchoup - pronounced \"chop\" - named after the famous road in New Orleans - which she couldn't stop raving about.\nEasily my favorite restaurant of the trip - I'll be back next time I visit the area","1599":"Rat's offers a very good, if not inspiring meal. I've been twice, once for a banquet which was exceptionally well run.\n\nThe reason to detour here is the Grounds for Sculpture. Make sure you arrive early and wander the grounds in the daylight.","1600":"I feel like Rats is having an identity crisis. Are you upscale? Rustic? Fine dining? More casual? I'm personally not a fan of rustic food at fine dining portions and prices. \n\nTo start off, I'm judging this review based on price point and other meals I've had for the same amount. To put it simply: This place simply doesn't stack up. \n\nI've known about Rats for many years. On several previous trips to the Grounds as a child, I would wonder what the fancy restaurant tucked away by Monets bridge was like. I've always heard rave reviews and couldn't wait to finally try it out. \n\nThe ambience on the outside is reminiscent of Epcot in Disney world, dated and in need of an update. I hate gimmicks and it felt like that. I understand the artsy vibe but it wasn't sophisticated in that sense. Inside is very dark and dank and felt like a tavern. Fine, I guess. \n\nUpon arrival and through out the meal, our waiter was too busy, having had multiple tables in the same section and greeted and treated us with a sense of casualness that I wouldn't expect from an \"upscale\" French restaurant, rustic or not. As the meal progressed, dirty dishes would sit. Also, my drink was actually HANDED to me. Additionally, I hate reaching. Don't \"pardon\" your reach, pull tables out so servers can walk around. Again, I'm basing this all on price point and experiences at restaurants in the same category. Also, for the record I was a server before and understand expectations. \n\nFood was lackluster in flavor and appearance. I had the octopus (which I liked) and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. My guest had the shrimp stew which was basically 3 pieces of shrimp in stewed tomatoes (super disappointing). For entrees, I had the scallops and my guest had the lamb. Both were under seasoned and the lamb, as mentioned in other reviews, had a toughness to it.  My scallops were also room temp. I wouldn't dare ask for salt at a high end restaurant but it was tempting here. Not worth the price. \n\nDessert was fine, no complaints but overall I was disappointed. Im really only glad I had the experience but would not return. There are too many good restaurants to waste my money here.  \n\nTwo stars for friendliness of staff and lasting impression of food.","1601":"Holy crow! Amazing food. Shrimp Po Boy was beyond spectacular. Better then the PO Boys in Louisiana! The beer selection was spectacular as well. Great services.","1602":"Although I know the origin of the name Rat's (from Kenneth Grahame's classic, \"The Wind in the Willows\") I still find it to be an unfortunate choice for the name of a restaurant.  But that's about all that is \"unfortunate\".\n\nThe \"Grounds For Sculpture\" restaurant is designed to make you feel you have stepped into a building from Claude Monet's town of Giverny, including, off it's outdoor porch, an actual lily pond and bridge inspired by his work.\n\nTo tour the entire \"Grounds\" would take several hours but if you arrive 30 to 45 minutes early for your reservation, you can do as we did - check in at the desk and say you'd like to take a short walk around before coming back for dinner.  So after our brief walk in the early evening, we were seated inside the beautiful dining room - my view looking outside towards the misty pond and bridge.\n\nThe new Stephen Starr-provided chef  (Kevin Sbraga) has produced an exciting and beautiful menu.    The amuse bouche was a sliced-rolled piece of Prosciutto with a melon puree and it was delicious.  Both appetizers were amazing.  One was the Griggstown Quail with apple-beet puree, and seared foie gras.  The other was a Country Duck P\u00e2t\u00e9 with dried fig marmalade.\n\nThe entr\u00e9es, both beautifully presented, were 180 degrees apart in flavor -with both being fantastic.  The bolder of the two was the butter braised lobster tail placed across a seafood sausage, spiced with a saffron emulsion, with sea beans and fried vermicelli.  At the other end of the spectrum was the mild and amazing \"Halibut au Vapeur\", which was a poached halibut filet with artichokes, arugula,  tomato confit and surprisingly delicious smoked chickpeas.\n\nWe didn't order dessert but were brought a small dish of cookies to share.  With a decanter of wine, the bill came to around $135 before tip.  We are looking forward to sharing this beautiful place with our friends.","1603":"I had dinner here a few days ago with a fairly large Meetup group. I ordered the smoked salmon salad ($15.00 plus tax and tip or $18.17 total). The salad was good and quite large. The New Orleans decor is charming, as was our server, Kelsey. Prices are generally on the high side, but other than that, I love this place.","1604":"This place is amazing! The shrimp and grits is delicious and the drink selection does not disappoint! I highly recommended The Parish.","1605":"You pay top price for mediocre food. We were done a plate of food before she brought our mimosas. Pricey for the atmosphere I guess but $44.00 for a buffet I expect a wide array of food. It was packed in this small stair area with multiple door openings and the stairs. We had 12 people and called the day before for our reservation. For the larger group we had to talk to the manager. I guess they forgot to write it down because when we got there the host was clueless and we had to wait ughh. Wasn't too long but they acted like we were an inconvenience. The response should have been it will take us a few mins to seat you instead of quizzes of who we spoke to and telling us things must have changed since they spoke with you because we will have to figure something out. We could go somewhere else if you like???? We love Grounds for sculpture the restaurant is mediocre at best!","1606":"The Parish has exceeded my expectations. The food is flavorful and filling. They have local brews on tap for reasonable prices and also have unique cocktails. I went for lunch and had the Hatian pork sandwich which was sweet, spicy and moist. My husband had the fish and chips. The portion sizes of the food here are huge and you'll most likely have leftovers. My two favorite eats here were the hush puppies and the bread pudding. The bread pudding is a large enough serving for two. Also our server Sunshine (lol) was awesome, attentive and hospitable.","1607":"Outstanding!  My husband and I were there for an anniversary celebration.  Our waiter, Scott, was so helpful with recommendations.  I love that every is seasonal and local. My husband started with the French Onion Soup and we shared the Artisanal Cheese Board.  He raved about the soup and I can say I've never had fresher tasting cheese.  I had the seafood salad for an entree.  The shrimp and crab were fresh in a light tasting lemon vinaigrette over chickory with some avocado.  Hubby had the NY strip which was tender and done to perfection.  We each had a slice of Strawberry Rhubarb Cheesecake.  It was somehow light, decadent and creamy all at once. \nDon't pass up this gem.  The atmosphere, the service, OMG the FOOD will create an experience.","1608":"It's a beautiful restaurant that makes you feel like you are in Europe somewhere. I think you just have to have a liking for French food before going in there since the menu is very unique and for us, it seemed very expansive for what we got out of it. However, I would recommend it as a quick stop for a drink while taking a break from all the walking at the grounds for sculpture. \n\nJust learn from our mistake.. if you do decide to have dinner there while at grounds for sculpture... park at the restaurant and buy your tickets at that gate. Otherwise if you finish dinner after the park closes, you might be in for a very creepy walk through the grounds for sculpture to get to your car. Can't say I enjoyed that.","1609":"This is an amazing restaurant serving delectable southern cuisine.  The spices they use make the entrees very flavorful. Great place to dine with great libations.","1610":"I first went here about 5 years ago with my boyfriend at the time. The atmosphere was very interfering. The restaurant is very beautiful, interior and exterior is strategically designed to catch your attention. On a beautiful day, there is nothing like having a great meal and going for a walk in the amazing garden. I went again last year and it still lead up to my expectations--even the second time around. The food and staff are wonderful. Summertime is the best time to go in my opinion.","1611":"Love it, we went for our anniversary .The bar was great,The restaurant & grounds so Romantic . The food was unbelievable. Can't  wait to go back .Thank You","1612":"Great place to go! The food was great. Service was excellent. Very romantic settings.\nMake sure you see the sculpt garden, it's amazing! We sat outside in front of the pond. Love the mist on the pond. Looks like something you see in the movies.\nDefinitely take your significant other there. Will be back. Have to see the rest of the garden.","1613":"Food and service was awesome. The waiter was so attentive and had a fun personality.I ordered  the fish & chips is was great. My fiance ordered the drunken angel pasta and he that it was very tasty.  We will definitely be back!","1614":"Second visit to the Parish this evening...and well worth it!    Our first visit was at lunch...which we enjoyed...and our dinner today measured up.   My wife had the Drunken Angel and said it was excellent...she'd give it a 5.   I had the mussels and they were very good.   We'd order both again!\nService was very good and atmosphere is very comfortable and lively.\nThe reason I didn't give it a 5 is that I've only been there twice.   I feel I'd need to have a couple more experiences at exceptional levels to confirm a 5.\nWe'll definitely be back...","1615":"So this place has a great charm thats not typically found on Oracle Road. I started the night out with some bacon popcorn which were really tasty and hard to stop eating. Then came the main course of smoke pork with adobe bbq sauce sandwich. Not my typical order but i just had to try it and I ordered the side salad with lemon blue cheese vinaigrette so I wouldn't feel too guilty. The sandwich was actually quite tasty with a mix of flavors. Smoky, spicy, sweet and salty... Maybe a little too salty. I recommend sharing this sandwich as I only could eat half. And well there were so many other tasty looking items that my friends got that sharing is always a good idea. The shrimp and grits and drunken angel hair pasta looked amazing and well worth me going back for another taste! Overall it was a great experience at The Parish tonight.","1616":"I live in San Francisco and if you have ever been here you know that this is a very \"foody\" town.  We are snobs about our food and If you are a subpar place to dine, you will be out of business in no time.  With that said, I was visiting Tucson for a wedding over the weekend.  Over the course of our trip we ate at several different places.  I ate at Chad's Steakhouse, Janos, and several others.   The Parish was the ONLY place my girlfriend and I ate at that wasn't mediocre at best.  For example, at Chad's I asked our server if their beef was grass-fed and free range.  She looked at me like I was crazy and I am pretty sure she had never been asked that before.   Im sorry, but if you are a steakhouse you should know where your beef comes from.  \n\nOn to The Parish.  We came in and the decor was very cool.  It was totally something you would find in the Bay Area.  I loved the artwork and when I found out it came from disabled children it made me love the vibe of this place even more. Our server was very attentive and friendly.  Our drinks were always filled and I don't recall ever having to ask for anything.  We ordered the wings, the bacon and eggs, the gumbo, and a burger.  WE PIGGED OUT!! The wings were very tasty,  they didn't taste like they came from a bag and fried.  The Gumbo was absolutely amazing. I am from Louisiana and If there is one thing i am picky about, it is my Cajun food.   Part of me ordered it because I had a bet with myself that it would be terrible.  It was some of the best Gumbo I have ever had and stands up to anything you get in New Orleans.  The presentation was on par to what I had at Janos.   The Bacon and Eggs was not at all what I expected. The bacon was this huge thick piece of pork belly and you could tell that it had been marinated for days.  The grit cake that it was on was a perfect touch and I don't even like grits.  My girlfriend had the burger so I can't speak to that but she seemed to enjoy it very much.  \n\nI loved this place so much I spent a good 20 minutes trying to sell them on opening up a place here in San Francisco.  For now, I guess I will just have to wait until another friend from Tucson gets married.","1617":"Absolutely the worst meal in a long time and for the incredible price of $50 per person. The fish was bad, the beef over cooked, the soup cold, the eggs Benedict dry and tasteless. The French toast was old, dry and inedible. There was not much of a choice in salads and those that were there, were so unappetizing. Dessert was a plate of unappealing  mini desserts that were not very tasty with dried out cheesecake, custard tart that had unripe fruit. The manager was unsympathetic and disinterested. The only redeeming thing was our waitress who gave us good service.","1618":"Driving thru Tucson from Houston on my way to Cali and didn't want to stop at a fast food place. Found the Parish on Yelp and it was sooooo worth the stop.  I ordered the Drunken Angel pasta and it was awesome.  The best pasta I've eaten. Can't even mention the great service! Definitely recommend!","1619":"This is as good as it gets. The food is great, the service is great, and the atmosphere is incredible. We went to Grounds for Sculptures for the first time, which is awesome in itself by the way, and was told to make reservations for Rats restaurant. I thought if you need to make reservations in must be popular and good. My friend was right and I'm so glad we went here for lunch. They also have a nice wine, beer, and spirits menu. We started with the Proven\u00e7al Mezze for the Table and were not disappointed. A rather large plate of hummus, eggplant salad, quinoa tabbouleh, olives, and flat bread. The eggplant salad was fantastic. I would have had that for lunch itself. For my main course I had fresh trout. It was a nice fillet which was cooked to perfection and tasted awesome. We don't normally order dessert but with the food tasting so good we knew we had to. We got the 3 flavors of ice cream (coffee, kaffir lime, and rice pudding) along with the mini doughnuts with three sauces to put on them; raspberry, vanilla creme, and nutella. Again, everything was fantastic.\n\nThe service was top notch. Our server and all the assistants were great. Very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the manu. \n\nBut what really makes this a 5 star review is the incredible garden outside on the patio. It's connected to grounds for sculptures and is really beautiful. We did walk through the inside and it looked fantastic also. I don't think you could go wrong eating inside or out.","1620":"It had been quite a few years since I had eaten at Rat's, and I recall having had a pleasant experience.  We were only able to get very late lunch reservations on the Sunday we went and therefore could not check out their brunch as we had hoped.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time.  We ordered a couple of appis to share - enjoyed the grilled oysters and the provencal mezze.  The menu itself while somewhat short certainly offered something for everyone.  So far so good ...... so why 3 stars?  We were a party of five:  two ordered the featured trout dish, two ordered the moroccan lamb stew and one ordered the chicken schnitzel.  Trout and chicken eaters were happy - however there was a moment when we actually felt like we were on Candid Camera as the 'lamb stews' were placed on our table.  Sorry to say that I did not take a photo - but imagine two plates of primarily plain couscous being placed on the table and each had no more than a tablespoon of stew plopped atop and about 6 chick peas.  At $23 per plate (the second priciest item on the menu) we were stunned.  We opted out of any after lunch items and did ask our waitress what the dish typically looked like (she had not served it nor had she seen what we were served) - she said that she felt it typically came with a nice amount of stew.  We shared our experience - which she relayed to the kitchen and our bill was reduced by one of the lamb stews.  While we certainly appreciated the adjustment we continued to be shocked how any kitchen could have allowed those dishes to leave their space and be presented to customers. So disappointed, especially since we were so looking forward to our visit.","1621":"Extremely picturesque location. The Restaurant is designed to look like a country home in Giverny. Interesting steam effects are created by water devices in the outdoor area. We ordered Steak Frites, Potato Leek Soup, and Beet Salad. The cold Potato Leek Soup was the most amazing treat of the day. It was incredibly creamy, and tasted like the best chip dip I have ever had. The steak Frites were well cooked and the fries well seasoned. The Creme Brulee was just the right consistency. The sculpture park is included with the meal.","1622":"Went to Rats happy hour last Friday.      Awesome bartenders. Friendly  on top of things.  Will be going back to see them.     Prices were good","1623":"I love this place!!! Great atmosphere, food is beyond amazing! My favorite place to eat in Tucson!","1624":"This is a very nice restaurant with a tasty menu.  Our dinner choices were good to excellent.  The service was energetic, friendly, and helpful.  They also have a  creative drink menu and great beer list.","1625":"At this point I have had most items on the menu. Great for happy hour after work or to take your mom for Mother's Day. Great drinks ( I recommend the Doctor) and the also have Purple Haze!!! Love the chile relleno and the pork chop is the best in town. Dessert is crazy! I have never liked bread pudding in my life and I cannot stop eating it from The Parish. I would be so happy if they would do a gumbo poutine with cheese curds! This place takes it to the next level. Hard to believe this is on the Northside and not downtown. Keep up the good work! A location on the eastside is desperately needed;) Bring back restaurant row.","1626":"The restaurant itself is awesome, everything is a peice of art! The wine and beer menu was perfect to taste, I highly recommend the Reisling from Unionville. The bread and herb butter was to die for and the onion soup was delicious! We got complimentary mulled wine and treats as well from the chef. My husband and I both got the monk fish...dish was good, but I didn't think it was worth $40...would have priced it at $30 tops. Overall had a great experience and will definatley be back! 4 stars for the value of the entree and that they asked if we were celebrating for reservations...we were celebrating an anniversary, but besides saying \"Happy Anniversary\" once they didn't do anything else.","1627":"Love the Parish. Their menu is full of delicious items   They're nice and helpful since I had questions regarding their menu. It was my first time having frog legs and they were great! It's nice to see other types of cuisine in Tucson other than the typical Mexican food here. I'd recommend it for anyone wanting something different but delicious. They also have a nice bar you can sit at too.","1628":"I know everyone's experience and tastes are different, but this is not a 3 1\/2 star restaurant. I love the yelp community but I had to stop reading reviews before I tried Rats for the first time. A lot of people mentioned small portions but we certainly didn't have that problem. My burger was the perfect size, and my fiance only ate half of her French dip. With that said this is a French restaurant, and I expect small portions at French restaurants. However, no issue for us on this trip. Our server was friendly, attentive, and timed the meal and the drinks very well - in short, he was excellent. The bartender was also on point and made us several cocktails that weren't on the menu. Much appreciated. The decor, lighting, and interior of Rats are beautiful and classy. The view, particularly if you can sit outside, is breath taking. Yes - Rats is expensive. But this restaurant is an experience and I didn't regret a single dollar spent and can't wait to go again!","1629":"Service and meal was great. I had the gumbo. Can wait  to try the shrimp and grits next trip.","1630":"Ambience terrific, food lovely & delicious. Just sorry we live too far away to dine there more often, Florida a long drive!!","1631":"Our Cajun dinner here last night was superb. The drink menu is as interesting as the food menu, and all four of our entrees were wonderful: the Drunken Angel, Smokey Angel, Gumbo, and Shrimp and Grits. The Goat Cheese Relleno appetizer is a wow. Our waiter was friendly and attentive - no complaints there. This was our first visit to The Parish, but we'll definitely be back.","1632":"Finally got the opportunity to come to this restaurant. Made sure to make a reservation (hard to get) for lunch with my girlfriend for her birthday. Just pulling into this place you're in awe, checking everything out. Once inside, even more oohing and ahhing, every room as pretty as the next. \nWe chose to sit out on the patio. So glad we did. As luck would have it, we were the only ones there, and got (I think) the best table out there. We were situated right by the beautiful pond, with several ducks and koi as company. \nOur waiter (which is why it's only a four, would definitely have given it 5 stars), although friendly, seemed a little not sure of himself and robotic at times, telling us the daily specials, etc. We chose the lunch special which was a steak sandwich covered with gruyere cheese on a brioche bun, with an onion soup dipping juice (supposedly) and special fries (which we ended up feeding to the ducks and koi. Not that they were bad, but the wildlife were making us feel really guilty lol). \nOur lunch started with fresh warm bread and scallion butter. Delicious and very hard to resist so I gave away the rest of the bread to avoid more temptation. Our waiter highly recommended a specialty drink which I ended up ordering. Although it was refreshing like he said, it's not something I would order again for myself. Our lunch arrived shortly later and was delicious. \nAs we were sitting there, the patio really started filling up. I overheard our waiter giving the same scenario to various other patrons, not once coming back to our table to see if we needed anything else. \nFor dessert we ordered an amazing gluten free chocolate cake which came with grilled(?) peaches and lavender buttercream dots, along with a cup of tea for myself. Our waiter came over with a messed up tea box (luckily I knew which one I wanted), but never inquired about what (if anything) I would like with my tea. He even brought our check in the middle of our dessert.\nI would absolutely love to come back here, between the beautiful scenery, or the food, I personally love this place, and I just found out that they have a Happy Hour! Awesome! \nWould love to come here for a special occasion! Worth the road trip!\nP.S. - Be sure to check out Grounds For Sculpture which is located on the grounds!! That's my next review.","1633":"I have been here a few times and I must say this small place packs a big punch.  I enjoyed the pull pork sandwich with a small cup of gumbo.  The flavors were strong and unique making each bite richer.  Great assortment of beers and house infused vodkas make this place unique.  the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable.  Definitely check this gem out.  My only complaint is that the jazz music was a little loud especially for lunch.  keep it up.","1634":"Ya got to give this place a try. Looks like a dive bar depending on the door you come in. Chef won the 2017 Iron Chef Tucson award. Really good happy hour. Bacon popcorn is just something that you have to order to setup the dinner. Stuffed quail was excellent. Our group loved the smoke pork chop and the steak and frites with Jack Daniels sauce was to die for. \n\nService was outstanding. They start playing live music (R&B) in the evening. We were there on a Monday night. They deserve all of their 4 stars.","1635":"Rat's serves nice French-inspired food in a gorgeous setting. After exploring the Grounds for Sculpture for a while, we tried the following for lunch:\n--Tarte aux Champignons- amazing- flaky, creamy and rich\n--Farro Salad- possibly my favorite dish (and I HATE salad)- the figs were a delicious touch!\n--Croque Madame- pretty much your average croque madame\n\nFor dessert I loved the cinnamon apple creme brulee, and the beignets with three dipping sauces were a huge hit.","1636":"Food and service was great! So good! Goat Cheese Rellano was delicious!! My husband had the Steak and Frites - again delicious!","1637":"Rats is a great place to hang out during happy hour.  The bartenders are attentive and extremely friendly...  What they offer at the bar food-wise is so so. Overall, not too bad for the social aspect. If you're hungry, I would recommend grabbing a bite to eat and then hit Rats for a drink.","1638":"Very expensive for the amount of food you get.  Portions are small. The food is good but at forty five dollars a person for lunch with no alcohol I was disappointed. Also, if you eat at the restaurant you should not be charged for the tour of grounds.","1639":"My Fianc\u00e9 and I went here for dinner last night. Walking into the place it was well decorated and some of the pictures were funny. The place was also packed. We ordered the Bacon Popcorn and Skillet Corn Bread first. The Popcorn is out of this world. Great Bacon flavor and still hot when brought to the table. The corn bread was super fluffy and amazing. We both that the Fish and Chips. Fish was good,( not a huge Tilapia fan at all) and fries were the bomb. Will be back in this place again soon.","1640":"Definitely one of our favorite places for dinner. Their take out was just as good as eating in the restaurant. Prompt and courteous service, great flavors. Will definitely be making this a regular stop.","1641":"I have been several times and always leave feeling satisfied.  The food quality has fluctuated over the years but it is once again top notch.  I last went for a Unibrouwe brewery tasting dinner.  The beers were very good and the food was really good.  The spring beets were especially good and I don't usually like beets.  The location is great if you like world class sculpture gardens.  Go for a nice walk and finish with an amazing meal.","1642":"This is a pretty cool place- it's owned by the former owner of Kingfisher. I love New Orleans and anything of that vein, so this is right up my alley. \n\nThe food was very good- I enjoyed everything I tried. We had the Fresh Gulf Oysters (7$) which had a smokey tomato type flavor- super good- you get 4 decent sized oysters for the price. I usually prefer raw oysters sans the fancy toppings, but this stuff managed to compliment the oysters and still keep everything fresh tasting. \n\nThe Pimpinadas (9$) were different..still not sure if all the flavors actually complimented each other, but I liked the idea. These are empanadads, stuffed with jerk chicken, covered with peach marmalade, topped with fried plantains, with a side of jicama slaw. I like all these things..maybe just not together. Fun dish to try out though. \n\nWe also had the Hot legs le'jean (8$) which are frog legs with a horseradish rub, wrapped in bacon, and covered in a remoulade. Very yum. \n\nThere are so many other things on their menu that I would love to try, so we will definitely be back. They have rotating daily specials  that looked really nice and their cocktails looked sooo nice. They also have a very cool beer selection- lots to try out. Some cool local (LA local) ones like Abita and Andygator which we love.","1643":"I'm from the South, but I can't eat beef or pork. It's hard to find \"home cuisine\" that won't make me ill. I am delighted to report that the Parish delivers amazing, delicious food that isn't too spicy. There are plenty of wonderful options to choose from: the eggplant sandwich (add goat cheese to it!), the hush puppies, ice tea brewed correctly, individual corn breads (after 4 pm), and an \"nosh\" plate of Pecan Smoked Ruby Red Trout that includes roasted garlic, a little salad, and candied pecans. Definitely get the hush puppies--they are light and fluffy and real easy to eat.","1644":"This is my perfect experience trifecta.  Phenomenal bartenders who can craft a fabulous drink, a small but perfectly executed menu with revolving specials, and a fabulously funky yet classy atmosphere.  \n\nThe oysters are rich and decadent - there were only four in the appetizer that my husband and I shared but that's all you needed (unless you are in a party of 10...y'all would be fighting over them!)  Hints of bacon and Gorgonzola (if I'm remembering correctly, it has been a while since I had this particular app) packed some serious flavor.\n\nThe bar menu is well thought out and meticulously executed.  I've tried the Aqua Vita and the Well Water and they were balanced, flavor wise, and potent!  The wine list is decent and the beer selection has some lovely additions that are not super common.\n\nI've tried a variety from the menu, but my favorite thing would be The Big Hippie, with added goat cheese.  The flavors are just sumptuous, the bun is hearty without being greasy, and the crisp veggies that top the sandwich add a wonderful texture to the whole sandwich.  The fries are clearly homemade, and executed very well.  They are seasoned beautifully and do not need the addition of a dipping sauce like some fries do.\n\nMy husband digs their fish and chips - which is billed as the World's Crispiest Fish and Chips.  They indeed manage to have the crust be very crisp (and not soggy) but the fish inside is moist, tender, and melts in your mouth.\n\nHe also thinks their Parish Burger is hands down the best burger in Tucson. And he's a rabid red meat eater and will usually order a burger while out (mainly because I do not eat\/cook red meat at home).  \n\nThere was one dessert we had - a peanut butter bar thing - that was unbelievably good.  It was kind of like a Reeses peanut butter cup on crack.\n\nHighly recommended, but make sure if you want to go on a weekend night to make reservations.  It's not a huge restaurant and it DOES get wicked busy.","1645":"I have always loved Rats. The service, the atmosphere and of course the amazing food! It is the end or the beginning of any amazing day at the Grounds for Sculpture. I love going there and trying something new each time. Their drink menu is also wonderful. I have yet to experience their breakfast but I am hoping to soon, seeing as I have only heard great things. Rats never ceases to amaze me in its beauty and interesting food selection. If you want to know a true secret, try the burger!!","1646":"Their pimpanadas blew us out of the water! We normally do not order appetizers with our lunch, but looking through the menu, this one stood out to us as a very unique dish in town. And we were thoroughly impressed with how they mixed the sweet and savory in this dish.\n\nMissing some New Orleans comfort food, I ordered the gumbo. My friends ordered a the big hippie vegetarian burger and a smokin' angel. The eggplant in the burger was well done, the sauce in the pasta went well with the baguette they provided, and the gumbo tasted like a wonderful flashback.\n\nThe service was kind as well, our server ensured that we had everything we needed and checked up on us frequently.","1647":"This was our first time here! And it will not be the last time! I took my mother and my niece for dinner. My Brice and I had the Parish Burger, mom had the pulled pork sandwich. OMG the food was amazing! The portions were huge and yes, we brought home half of our dinners. When you go you have to have the homemade pork rinds and the hush puppies! The service was great and the restaurant was very comfortable. Truly a Tucson treasure!  August 2 2019-\nMy nieces and I went back today. I had the Gumbo- it was amazing! One niece had the 'drunken angel pasta..wow! It was angel hair pasta with a burgundy sauce with crawfish and lobster sauce, just delicious! My other niece had the salmon salad, so fresh and delicious! The service was perfect and our Server was awesome!","1648":"Great food and drinks. Had an amazing pata and seafood dish. Can't wait to try more on their menu.","1649":"Wending one's way alongside a quaint pond scene emulating Monet's lilies, anticipation of the perfect location for lunch, or brunch or whatever you have in mind - the menu is unclear as to timings - begins to rise. But why bother? Ignored by at least half a dozen distracted, indifferent and most likely overworked and underpaid table staff we attempted to locate whichever unfortunate was allocated the seemingly herculean challenge of 'managing' the reservations (yes, we had one). Of course our 'hostesses' were pleasant; they had been taught to grin like that for years. Lulled into a sense of prevalent charm we fell into the trap; we asked if it was possible - asked, that is not demanded, and we used the word 'please' several times - to sit at an outside table. First it was 'we don't allow reservations at outside tables', then 'we will put in a request' then 'the outside tables cannot be reserved' despite us noting 'reserved' signs on several tables to that effect on the way in. So which truth are we expected to believe?  Shrugging this off as an unproductive course, we acceded to being shown to 'our table' upstairs where we understood brunch - for it was brunch we had booked - was being served 'buffet style'. Now I have done enough business class hotels to be wary of anything left lying about for too long and have an aversion to 'buffet' of any kind, but a particular aversion to 'buffet' at those prices. No matter, we grimaced, we will take lunch instead, hoping at this point that something resembling civil accommodation might be had. Certainly, 'you can follow her'...towards the buffet area. So, by now we had been treated to that annoyingly passive aggressive bonhomie that seems to count for customer service among those who have never experienced it, been lied to three times on the strict understanding that it was corporate policy that we should believe those lies and now find ourselves bring led up to..well what exactly? The last time I was in a room that dark and shambolic was a very old tearoom to which I had been dragged under protest by my grandmother. And the carpet smelled the same. The menu consisted of the usual thaw it and serve it 'catering' that seemed a long way from the creativity of whatever so-called famous chef was alleged to be in residence. That the waiter, bless him, could not fathom our desire to be left to settle in before attacking us with a water jug was the last straw. Exit. Rapidly. In summary? Just don't.","1650":"Have had 2 meals here and come to the bar once. Meals were both enjoyable, the menu is a little over priced I think. Especially the po boy, was disappointed in the amount of oyster. \n\nGood beer selection and house cocktails too.","1651":"So happy we chose The Parish last night! Very comfortable and nicely furnished, we sat at a table in the bar. Our server was prompt to the table with a great wine recommendation. Happy Hour wine at $4\/glass is a deal- very generous pour of a nice, lush and soft red blend. Our server was personable. lively and spot on with the suggestions. Arrived in time for Happy Hour appetizers. The Hush Puppies are awesome nuggets of sweet&spicy deliciousness. The accompanying tartar sauce was a cool and creamy compliment to these crispy little gems. My friend loved them so much she chose the gumbo dinner which came with more Hush Puppies. She  loved the gumbo, perfectly spiced, full of sausage and seafood, and just the right touch of heat. I had the shrimp & grits with sweet potato pur\u00e9e, all delicious. Lots of shrimp atop a crispy, thick fried cake of grits with a rich, creamy, spicy sauce. The sweets were decadent, smooth, rich, and buttery. Such a large portion I took half home and I'm already greedily anticipating tonight's dinner of Parish leftovers. Unfortunately had to leave after dinner but the band was setting up for live music. I'll be back soon to enjoy more fabulous food, delightful service, and hear some live music.","1652":"I frequent the Parish a few times a month, and to this day have yet to have a poor experience in any regard at this establishment. Exceptional across the board; the ambience, the wait staff and the food are culminated spectacularly resulting in one of the best dining experiences in all of Tucson. While one can't go wrong when ordering anything on the menu; the tchoup, alabama quail, hot legs le jean, and the bananas foster are all-star palate pleasers. I could write a column on the masterfully-crafted imbibements alone, so I'll simply posit that should one so choose to indulge, the cocktail selection is tremendous. If you haven't made your way to The Parish, you're doing yourself a disservice.","1653":"The front desk woman was abrupt, telling us that they only take reservations for lunch. It was almost 90's that day. I asked if the bar is OK, she said she had not been there to check. We had been there many many times so we walked to the bar and there were seats. As we walked to the bar area, there were many many tables empty, the back room were half empty and outside were empty tables!  and they were pushing people away.  What a snub! \nThis takes the beauty of the place away from Rats! The management must meet with the front desk people and must change their attitude! I am not the only customer that make this comment. We were there Saturday July 5,2014 around 2PM.","1654":"Unbelievable Find in Tucson! Came across this for lunch today and had the salmon salad; it was so amazing I came back for dinner. I had the Drunken Angel pasta and it was to die for! The pasta is cooked in burgundy and dish is full of crawfish cream sauce and large shrimp that were cooked to perfection. Sat at the bar and it's just a great place with a lot to look at and the bartender was very friendly. I'll definitely be back! Will be one of my favorite stops in Tucson.","1655":"Southern with a French creole twist. Fantastic staff. Always busy. Only wish was a broadened dessert and beer menu. Had the steak, fish and chicken options all of them delicious. The salad is fantastic with lots of various greens preparation. I'm not the type to take pics of my food but believe me when I say the presentation was on point. For Tucson nice choice for a Friday night with your boo or a small group.","1656":"Reservations for 8 at 2:30 PM for an early Mothers Day. Sat at 3 PM with only 7 seats. Reluctantly we took one for the team and squeezed in. Outside seating was very nice and the view was great. It took the waiter 5+ minutes to make an appearance. Once he did he was knowledgable and friendly. Drink order took a good 10+ to arrive and one cocktail was forgotten. The table ordered charcuterie and hummus which also took way too long to arrive-maybe longer than 15 minutes. The appetizers were very good and everyone enjoyed. The main courses arrived on time for everyone and were decent. 3 people got the mussels which were deemed okay, but lacking flavor. 3 people got the burger which turned out nice. What I found interesting was my wife and I had dined here before a few months prior for dinner and it was outstanding. Maybe a bad day?","1657":"My sister was visiting from CA, so we went to the Sunday brunch over Thanksgiving weekend. While the food was good and the atmosphere beautiful, I found the brunch overpriced ($44) for the quality and amount served. Comparable brunches serve complimentary champagne; Rat charges. Service was quite attentive. The stand-outs were the peeled shrimp and chicken and waffles.","1658":"Amazing restaurant. I loved the view and walkthrough of the garden. Everything here was amazing. A brunch turned into breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. Amazing experience. Loved every minute of it.","1659":"This was our first time here! And it will not be the last time! I took my mother and my niece for dinner. My Brice and I had the Parish Burger, mom had the pulled pork sandwich. OMG the food was amazing! The portions were huge and yes, we brought home half of our dinners. When you go you have to have the homemade pork rinds and the hush puppies! The service was great and the restaurant was very comfortable. Truly a Tucson treasure!","1660":"The GOOD, the BAD, & UGLY!!!\n\nStart with the GOOD, food overall has been great I have been there 3 times now and its been great with the exception of the pretzel bits that were outstanding on the first trip but nasty on the second. the BAD, chairs, tables and limited menu and space, but the place is trying, and i give them much credit for the budget, i guess? the UGLY is the outside patio, they could really utilize this but you look at it and its not very inviting. Let's work on filling this space with pots flowers umbrellas etc. Good Luck i will continue to go this this cool concept of a place. a bit pricey!! Great beer by the way!!\nTommy","1661":"Just walking into The Parish and the experience begins. The hostess stand is a repurposed 1930's wooden encased radio. The deco is pink striped walls, chandeliers and crushed velvet. The menu is filled with creative and unique versions of standard fair. \n\nThe Parish' take on bacon and eggs is stunning. The pork belly was tender and delectably flavorful. The complementing spicy lemon hollandaise sauce and white chedder grits were pure perfection. \n\nThe other meals at our table were equally creative and flavorful. Our table ended up sharing a cast iron pancake with lemon curd, inspiring our mouths to sing boundless praise.\nFurthermore, their cold brewed coffee is no simple matter. They prepare it by bathing the caffienated delight in a nitrogen tank, infusing both air bubbles and class into our coffee. \nDo yourself a culinary favor and stop by The Parish for an incredible gastro experience you will never forget! \nThank you Jeff for your fabulous service!","1662":"We saw the great Yelp reviews and gave it a try on our Tucson day trip. We love the classic-cocktail menu and tried the Dutch Well Water with House-infused cucumber gin and the Sazerac.  We sipped our cocktails and munched on bacon popcorn while waiting for lunch. The shrimp po boy and adobo pork sandwiches were too big for grown women to eat, but we didn't take a doggie bag. And, after all that, we ordered the ridiculous bread pudding for dessert. We might have pull over for a nap on our drive back to Phoenix. YUM","1663":"Every time I come here I am more impressed than the last time.  Burgers are wonderful.  Appetizers are great, and I believe I have tried them all by now.  The crawfish hushpuppies are wonderful, and they come with some sort of addictive sauce.  I had the \"drunken angel\" which is a pasta dish where the angel hair is boiled in wine...and I hate wine...however, this particular dish is truly the level of one you would want for your last meal.  \n\nOH...OMG...and the booze!  Mercy, the drinks are fantabulous.  They make many of their own infusions there.  We did damage to the drink menu during our visit.  They were all great.  \n\nMake this one of your Tucson stops!","1664":"Love the Hushpuppies! Beer selection is great. Atmosphere great! One of my favorites places to go though my husband is not as crazy about southern cuisine.","1665":"We celebrated my fathers birthday with the 5 course tasting menu and wine pairings. Everything was absolutely delicious and authentic. The wines were amazing and very generous pours. We were a large party and the service was also wonderful. We have been here several times before and they never disappoint. Will come back again and again.  One of our favorite restaurants for sure!","1666":"Hostess who answered the phone was illtrained had inadequate phone manners, was unable to complete a coherent sentence. Called today for a table at 5:30 for 3 and no such luck even while asking to be seated in the bar. Hostess never bothered or tried to accommodate us. Not a good receptionist. I'll take my money elsewhere...","1667":"So disappointed! Rats has gone down hill. When it first opened it was the pinnacle in the Central Jersey area and a staple for us. My husband is French and he felt at home. It has deteriorated to a mediocre menu and curt dismissive wait staff. The sculpture gardens used to be open to dining guests not anymore. Overpriced and not worth it anymore.","1668":"I had gone with a group of three for a little birthday celebration. It is a nice rustic looking chateau style house. They mentioned it is a French country style with a modern twist menu. The service was very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. For cocktails, ordered Southern Stars and Texas Mules. They were both pretty tasty, the Southern Star wasn't as spicy as the waiter mentioned (which is probably a good thing). Appetizer wise, ordered onion soup, mussels, and grilled octopus. Was a fan of everything but probably wouldn't order the mussels again. They bring out a chef's treat, which that night, was gazpacho. The octopus was grilled perfectly and tasted delicious. I had ordered the pork collar for a main course, was pretty good. The orzo served with it was delicious. Had no room for dessert, but chef's treat was a few pieces of brownie and lemon tarts.\n\nWith the sculpture grounds right there, it is a very nice place. They also allow you to check out their garden during dinner. It was a very pleasant experience. \n\nWould give it 4.5 stars if I could.","1669":"Definitely make a reservation - they are a bit quirky about reservations even when they appear to have open tables. \nThe ambience is wonderful yet different depending on the room you're seated in or if you are fortunate enough to sit on the outside patio looking over the pond and sculptures. \nMy mom and I started lunch with a review of the drink menu listing a variety of unique elixirs and cocktails settling on a pear honeysuckle martini and a tigers blood cocktail with blood orange infused vodka. \nFor lunch I chose the pastrami sandwich on Russian black bread. I could taste the essence of the pastrami, celery slaw and whole grain mustard before I even took my first bite. It was served with with a mustard potato salad and a crispy green garlic pickle. Mom chose a traditional Cobb salad that was beautiful and fresh with terrific apple wood bacon as garnish. \nFor dessert we shared the sugar doughnuts served with a berry dip, Nutella and vanilla custard. \nAll aspects of the food were great-appearance, texture and above all the flavor.\nThe staff was attentive and knowledgeable and prices were higher than an everyday lunch but a very special treat we will be sharing again very soon.","1670":"What a delight this restaurant is!  We had an early dinner at this restaurant on Christmas Eve.  They offered the lunch menu.  We ordered a salad, gumbo, catfish  po boy sandwich, drunken pasta.  Every dish was divine!  The services were attentive and fast.  If we visit Tucson again. we will definitely be going back.","1671":"Cute items, but so expensive. I can't bring myself to pay $24 for a canvas tote bag (the $1 bags you can find at any grocery store) just because it has Nevada on it, or spend $30+ for a candle. Cute store, way too pricey.","1672":"Frog Legs. Drunken Angel. Alabama Quail. Bread Pudding. \n\nTo attempt to describe how they tasted would just do it injustice. Go out there and try them out for yourselves. I can't wait to go back and taste their other dishes.","1673":"Neighborhood bar, Fabulous Food, great prices.  Winter staple is the gumbo, right mix of heat and comfort.  Everything is fab, favorites include gumbo(always have some in my freezer), wings, burgers, And my new favorite obsession:  pretzel bits with quest, yumtumyum","1674":"As a Louisiana boy transplanted to Arizona it was a treasure we found here.  The Abita beer on draft is just as good if back home.  Frog legs are a must as well as anything else on the menu.  But main course Shrimp and Grits were perfect.  Did I mention the Abita draft?  Seriously this is a must for anyone wanting to get an authentic Louisiana food experience.   The staff are friendly and very attentive to their customers.  Bryce thanks for bringing a little taste of home out west!!!!! Will be back two or three times a week and if for nothing else the Abita on tap!!!!!!!!!","1675":"With over 10 visits to the Parish I am proud to write a great review. The drunken angel is a MUST! In addition I always get a bottle of Freakshow to pair. I have gone for live music and even a fun magic show. Last Fathers Day my brother and I took my dad for a special Fathers day menu! This is my go to stop with every trip to Tucson.","1676":"I was very disappointed with this place after dinner here on Saturday night. \nAfter reading all the reviews and looking at pictures, I made reservations almost a month ago for my wife's birthday.\n\nOn the food. \nFor soup we both chose the French Onion Soup which was perfect. It was beautiful flavored, very rich and thicker consistency, it wasn't over powered with onions and the crouton in the soup still had a nice crunch to it and was not completely soggy. The gruy\u00e8re cheese was also perfect. This soup was definitely in the top 5 French Onion Soups that I have had, so far. \nWe also orders the Proven\u00e7al Mezze (hummus, eggplant salad, quinoa tabbouleh, olives, flat bread) was one of the dishes we were looking forward to having, unfortunately it was very very bland and tasted like baby food. The humus was very bland. The egg plant salad or baba ghanoush was over pur\u00e9ed and felt like a sloppy, flavorless mush. Olives were very salty and the quinoa had no seasoning or flavoring what so ever. There was only one thing going for this appetizer, and that was the flat bread. Very poorly done dish. \nFor main dishes, we went with three entrees. The Kobe Beef, Duck Breast and The Lamb. The Kobe beef was very very good, it was the only thing that saved me from asking for the manager and telling them how unhappy I was with the whole meal and leaving. It was beautifully flavored, (although it was medium temperature, but I asked for medium rare) it had a very good texture and was very tender. I would recommend this dish and this dish only. \nThe breast of duck was very bland and chewy. It felt like it was old and had a very very strong flavor of bacon which made it taste very salty and confusing the pallet. Same with the lamb, it was very very bland and chewy. It desperately needed more seasoning. This was a huge let down as these dishes were the main reason I picked this place. Overall as far as food, I would not come back here. \n\nNow the service....\nOur waiter was very very slow. We were there over 2 hours. There was a couple that sat about 15 minutes after us (had another lady waitress) and they left about 45 minutes before us. Our waiter must have been battling a cold or upper respiratory infection as he was very nasally and was wiping his nose pretty often. It's not his fault but if you have a cold, you should not be serving food. Period. \nBesides him being very slow, he called me \"Bro\" a few times. I'm not your Bro. Maybe save that kinds of language for the pub or a tavern but not for a restaurant of his caliber. \nHe also saw how displeased we were with the side of polenta that we barely touched, which my wife said tasted very odd and milky mushy, you would think he would offer to dock it from the check. Nope. Nothing. \nAfter siting there for over 2 hours with poor food and service, I honesty felt like I was robbed. Not only for the money, but more importantly to me, for my time. \nI didn't want to ruin the night by calling over the manager and just decided to pay and walk away. \nI am not sure I would come back here again.","1677":"The food was great.  We also had the popcorn bacon and hush puppies for appetizers and we really liked it.","1678":"An absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish!! \n\nArrived at 6:30 before happy hour ended. The place is so visually appealing that it takes me a minute to soak it all in. There are various separate rooms aside from the main dining area. The room we were in for happy hour was playful, with a Moroccan sort of theme- even had a bed on the floor for lounging while sipping cocktails.  Happy Hour drinks are 5 dollars, but unless you are having wine or beer, you may want to order off of the regular cocktail list. The Happy Hour food specials were awesome and all between 2-3 dollars! We had the eggplant and a variety of meats and cheeses. We hated the pate and the waiter was lovely enough to simply take it off our plate and bring another choice. \n\nBefore dinner, we walk the grounds, which you can do while sipping on your cocktail. The sculptures are life size and are both witty and interesting. Go ahead, take a picture with the naked lady, no judging here! To get into the main part of the sculpture garden, there is a fee (after 6 it's only 6 dollars) but it's absolutely worth it. You'll get to see even more life size (and much larger) sculptures, both modern and old (and some just plain strange). The Grounds are beautiful. Lots of greenery, lots of small \"bodies\" of water, nicely lit at night (but not as bright as it should be, so be careful or bring a flashlight after 8). \n\nOn to dinner, which is why we came here in the first place! Could the service get any lovelier? I think not. Well trained, well mannered, kind, and fun service all the way around.  The table was beautifully set and our server quickly came over to refill our drinks. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals: smoked chicken, crispy trout, hanger steak and frites - all well prepared and not lacking in flavor. Steak was tender and perfectly cooked and came already cut. Dessert was equally good: chocolate zucchini cake and lavender peach cake. All so unique and just enough sweetness. \n\nA lovely experience due to the excellent service (thank you Marco and Benny), the stunning grounds, and the delicious food!","1679":"A beautiful day spent starting with the most civilized and relaxing lunch at Rat's, with the most scrumptious food and impeccable service, followed by what seemed like a never ending trail of beautiful surprises awaiting us.  Nature, art and cuisine have collided here in the most splendid array of delight.\n\nWe started with amazing bacon infused Bloody Marys.  Enjoyed an appetizer that we could share, with hummus, quinoa salad, eggplant, olives, served with flat-breads.  Even the bread and butter basked was delicious, with flavored butters than intrigue the palate.  I had a lovely fuji apple salad, with blue cheese and poached chicken with the most amazing toasted candied walnuts, so good!  I shared a bite of my hubbys banana sorbet, was truly a memorable meal, and the waitstaff was top notch.  Perfect in every way!  C'est bon!!!","1680":"We love this place, the little patio is actually very enjoyable. I wish the frog legs were a little more simply cooked with butter, garlic and parsley; their horseradish sauce and bacon wrapped around the leg can be a bit overpowering. The drunken angel is to die for and we love to share the goat cheese relleno as an appetizer. I also order the grilled trout often but it was too salty a few times. The 1912 beer from the tap is also one of our fave.","1681":"We had Sunday brunch here.  Included in the meal was a welcome glass of champagne (or mimosa if you prefer), caviar (with crackers, various optional seasonings, and chilled vodka), an appetizer buffet (where you can get a complete meal, if you feel like it), a main course that you can order, and a dessert buffet.  Both the food and service were excellent.    We didn't order from the wine list because the champagne served our needs for this kind of meal.\n\nThe decor is elegant rustic.  The restaurant's name and theme is from \"Rat\" in the Wind in the Willows story.  The imaginative decorations reinforce this theme.\n\nThe main dining area is semi-formal, but there is a smaller room next to the bar that is less formal and could serve the needs of family style eating.  Both areas look out onto a patio at the edge of a pond.  In good weather I presume you could eat at tables on this patio (ducks to be fed are included).  In short, the visual experience of this restaurant is unusual and rewarding.\n\nAs a bonus for eating here, you get free admission to the adjacent Grounds for Sculpture, an expansive sculpture garden (plus exhibit halls) where you can spend an entire afternoon and still not see everything (see the Yelp review for Grounds for Sculpture elsewhere).  Rat's Restaurant and the Grounds for Sculpture are sort of affiliated with each other (the restaurant's menu says that they provide some support for the sculpture garden).\n\nOverall, we found that dining here was a great experience.\n\nBe sure to visit their website to get driving directions; they warn you that if you use Mapquest you'll surely get lost.\n\n[Disclosure notice on conflict of interest:  members of our family treated us to this brunch, and they will undoubtedly read this review.  So beware of this influence on our objectivity!]","1682":"It's about time that I review my beloved Rat's Restaurant.\nI live 10 minutes away and I've come here through the past 5 years and it has been consistent each and every time.\n\nTheir happy hour is great, while the bar room is a bit small but it's def worth it.\nA lot of lower priced apps, drink specials, and wine in a great atmosphere.\n\nI've been here for corporate events, private party events, and relaxing dinners with friends.\nThe food has always been consistent...while service was timely, the servers themselves have come at varying degrees of knowledge and skill which is unfortunate given the price tag of the final bill.\n\nMy fav. option is the prefix with wine pairing, when offered.\nMy favorite pre fix was with my friends on a summer evening - we enjoyed several courses consisting of personal cheese board, branzino, duck, and dessert - oh we added escargot to share.  Loved that yorkshire pudding that they serve the escargot with!  (its served differently now) The wines were served in ample portions with each course - it's lavish but worth it to treat yourself.\n\nWhat's keeping this from 5 stars is sadly the service.\nWhile I've had wonderful service in the past, especially during corporate functions - upon normal dine in the servers have been hit or miss.  It's sad when the servers don't know the difference between cheeses and I have to explain them - my friend should have known better to ask me before asking the server but anyho...\n\nIt's a great restaurant set within a very interesting sculpture park, lovely dining in the evening especially outside on warmer nights!","1683":"Ventured back into Rat's to try their happy hour last month.. I'd tried it before a few summers back and it was ok. This time, I was very pleasantly surprised. We were seated at a cute table near the window, so we were able to see the beautiful Buddha sculpture that sits on the water. Sorta spooky at night, but thrilling!\n\nWaiter wasn't the friendliest, but was attentive enough. They changed their happy hour menu for the better, IMO. I had the spiced pear martini.. wasn't strong at all, but very tasty. There was a thai peanuts app that was just seasoned peanuts--DELICIOUS! Salty and sweet which I love. The burger was decent and the empanadas were BANGING!!\n\nI would say to Rat's.. increase the amount of liquor in the drinks and I would give 5 stars! :-)","1684":"Phenomenal!\n\nThe setting us amazing. Go in nice weather and sit on the lovely patio. Beautiful food, beautiful location. \n\nThe cocktails are fantastic. I tried the spiced pear martini & I think it's the best cocktail I've had all year! Divine. \n\nSip a glass of wine or a divine cocktail & gaze at the mist gently rolling over the lady statue in the pond, the footbridge, the landscaping. \n\nThe Grounds for Sculpture is right next to the restaurant, so stopping here is a must.\n\nI tried the scallops. They were mouthwatering & delightful, but paired with cauliflower just didn't work for me. The textures didn't jive together. \n\nThis place is phenomenal.","1685":"The food is not the best I had, but it's gets four stars bc the ambience is fabulous!! Right in the grounds for sculpture in Hamilton and had a great grad school alum event here!","1686":"came here for a special occassion after exploring the grounds for sculpture. it came very highly rated by the MIL. ive been to some fancy dining and i have no issues spending money for delectible dishes. however this place is not just expensive, its extremely overpriced. the restaurant serves locally sourced seasonal plates, which is a plus. the decor is lovely and wait staff were great. however, this is where my compliments end.\n\nmy first issue is that i called ahead to make reservations and was told the place was booked for the night. however, i was able to secure a reservation through open table without problems.\n\n in terms of food, the restaurant falls short. i had a french onion soup which i expected to be fabulous. it was about as good as a five dollar soup from a regular restaurant, but twice the price. i also had duck breast seasoned with pepper seeds and fennel. i got maybe half a duck breast which was overly sweet and spicy (an attempt at oriental seasoning on duck i guess?) and really chewy--and i ordered a medium. the duck was gone in four bites. the dish cost 30 dollars.\n\nsomeone else at my table ordered \"butter lettuce\" as an appetizer and received a half of an iceberg lettuce with tahini dressing. ....and they had to cut the lettuce themselves to make  it a salad. what???? lol. \n\noverall, my impression is that the restaurant attempts to be fancy but its basically equitable to a five year old trying to wear her mommys evening attire and jewelry. dont bother with this place.","1687":"Travis Peters, Chef Extraordinaire, kills it every time. One of Tucson's best restaurants.","1688":"I have been to this place 3 times. Two of their Fat Tuesday partys and I went in today for lunch and I must say I'm very impressed. \n\n     I lived in Florida for ten years. While Florida is not anything like New Orleans I have had my fair share of Cajun food. Every year in South Florida they have an annual Crawfish Festival filled with all kinds of good Cajun food. \n\n     I have tried a few different things at The Parish. Crawfish flown in fresh from Louisiana, gumbo, jumbolaya, and today I had an awesome cajun pasta dish called The Drunken Angel. Filled with Crawfish and shrimp. All of the items I've tried here are bursting with cajun spice and flavor. The menu I must say is original and impressive. Theres something for everyone even if you've never heard of the Bayou. From bacon wrapped frog legs, to a monster sandwich called The Big Hippie your bound to find something you like. If this place doesn't turn you into a ragin cajun, nothing will.","1689":"I really love this place especially there fish and chips, probably the best in town. But it is pretty expensive. Which is the only thing that keeps me from going there Like every week. Instead I go every couple of months for a treat","1690":"What a find! The quail was tender, crispy and tasty. The fish and chips had great french fries, fish was average. The Ahumado  Fresca is The Drink!!! Dont try anything until u try this. Smokey, sweet, tangy! Stop in, support local!","1691":"Great breakfast! Great service. Unique menu. More than just your normal breakfast items.....they step \"outside the box.\"  We had a group of 8 and everyone enjoyed their meal.","1692":"The Parish is a Tucson staple. Food is to die for and the staff is the best in all of AZ hands down. Favorite spot to bring visitors to show off how much Tucson has to offer.","1693":"I wish I could give a half star. Restaurants are not only meant for food but for experience. I came in as a party of nine, clearly able to see 20-30 tables open and empty. The host was confused & replied 'I don't know' to how long it would take for a table, we were coming up with scenarios we even agreed to sitting at multiple tables. As for working in the service industry I understand that a party of nine may take a few minutes to accommodate, but a party of nine bringing in business should not be told I don't know, and refused a table because there are multiple reservations, the resturant was empty & there was no manager on site. \n\nIt is a shame when your restaurant is gorgeous, the food looked wonderful, but the people employed are up on their high horses acting as if they own the joint. \n\nMid conversation with the host with half a brain, a woman came up in tears so angry and upset about her experience and said \"everything was awful, I will never come back\" the host stared blankly rather than getting a manager, she did not care one bit. \n\nI would have been fired if that was me in my place if work. Absolutely terrible service. \n\nIf a managers reading you need to re evaluate your servers and hosts, this is a sculpture ground filled with wonderful art, maybe you would be better off jiggering some sculptures to run the restaurant, people would take a better liking to them. :)","1694":"AMAZING food! Drinks were fabulous, the bacon popcorn is to die for! I ordered the Shrimp & grits - SO good! Also had the crawfish Mac & cheese with pork belly on top. Great portions - brought a lot of food home. The service was spot on!! Very knowledgeable and helpful - made our experience great! Definitely going back!","1695":"This is not fine dining or a great restaurant--but it beats most of what this part of the world has to offer and at least you can go for a walk in the 20 acres of odd sculpture that is in its back yard.  Zero points for the strange fairy tale motif but kudos for the friendly staff.  The food reminded me of a well-executed Houston's, though the menu reads well and looks interesting.  Second time there, same opinion.","1696":"As many know, the Chef De Cuisine at this restaurant is starting to become more and more popular on the culinary scene. I just had to try this place out. So one late night, I talked my boyfriend into going to The Parish. We walked in about 30 minutes before closing. Luckily, they were willing to seat us because they could have easily and understandably said \"no.\" \nThe waitstaff was really good and a lot of fun to talk to. We probably had more fun listening to conversations at the bar here than any other restaurant we have been to.\nSo the best bite of food we had was the BBQ Tail Confit. So you know, this will be a 50\/50 for those who love it and those who dislike it. The main reason for this is because the pork tail is extremely fatty, so if you do not like eating fat, you will not like this. For me, this was amazing. There was a South Carolina BBQ sauce and pickled red onions that provided an acidic punch that broke through the savory, porky, fatty goodness of the pig tail. They waitress gave us little forks to tear the meat off, but screw that, we started to eat them like ribs. Could not let any of that savory goodness go to waste.\nFor the main course I ordered The Parish Burger and it was a really good burger. The burger itself was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and all of the flavors on this burger blending well together. My favorite bites were when the sweet red onion marmalade met the peppery blue cheese. Those two flavors needed each other, otherwise the whole burger would be overpowered by the punching bag of flavor they provide. Also just a side note, their hush puppies with tarter sauce are amazing. I do not like tarter sauce, but this one has an acidic, refreshing quality that is delicious. Best tarter sauce I have ever had.\nI will definitely be making the drive back to this place. Totally worth it.","1697":"This place has great food. Been for both brunch and dinner. Cool atmosphere as well. A little bit pricey but worth it from time to time.","1698":"What a great place the decor is cool.\nTaste of new Orleans.\nService was great and the food was fantastic. \nThe broth in the clams was amazing you could put that on an old shoe and it would be good to eat.","1699":"This place reminds me of Louisiana! It's a nice change of pace out here in the desert. I think the best part is the bar. So beautiful and ornate! Good food, fair prices and great service. Really enjoyed it. Also good for Sunday brunch.","1700":"Wow this southern Cajun restaurant is definitely worth visiting! All the appetizers looked amazing it was hard to choose. We went with the bacon wrapped frog legs and they were delicious (and legit ... bones in). Then we ordered the drunken pasta at the waiters recommendation. They boil the pasta in red wine - it was very unique and tasty. We also got the adoba pork sandwich. They definitely rely on their skills with the meat itself and not just the bbq sauce then they top it off with a pickle on a stick!  Wonderful atmosphere and live music. Will for sure return.","1701":"This place is small and quaint with food and drinks that are packed with flavor. They also have live music in the evenings. I had the Drunken Angel pasta dish and it was great! It was just the right amount of spice. They have seasonal cocktails which are usually all excellent. I had the \"hell in a hand basket\" and loved it. It was light and fruity for a bourbon drink. They also have great non-alcoholic or Mocktail options that are a fun alternative. They have a great happy hour and The Bacon popcorn was a great appetizer that didn't fill you up before your meal. We were there for a birthday and the waitress was amazing, attentive, and helped us make my friend's birthday special. Great service, great atmosphere, great food!","1702":"The interior is very nice and has a great view of the park outside next to a pond. However, the food is subpar and just too expensive for what it is, especially considering prices in the area. I got the cheese platter which was actually a substantial amount of food, olives (average) and the steak frites. Steak was not high quality and they really didn't seem to try at all when cooking it, no flavor. The salad was over salted and the fries were very thin (just not my personal preference).","1703":"The woman took me out to Rats tonight for my birthday and we ended up sitting in their cafe section. Let me say that she has always had an excellent experience here, but tonight must have been the exception. The service was horrible and impolite, the food was as cold as the room (frigid), and even as I wait here writing this I am STILL waiting for the manager to make this right. Simply an awful experience. The grounds for sculpture was amazing however.","1704":"We had a family celebration at Rat's (ugh, why do they call it that? Why is there a repulsive and suggestive rat statue in the men's room?) last weekend. From the service (slow and deferential) to the food (at best tasteless, at worst, uncooked and cold), it was just awful. Even the birthday cake had no flavor. I was a guest, so I don't know what the tab was, but I imagine it was quite high. And more, we were served from the regular menu--it wasn't like the chef had to make anything special--and it was still unacceptable. \n\nI love going to Grounds for Sculpture but will surely never eat here again!","1705":"Rat's is situated inside Grounds for Sculptures. There's a ticket booth right outside the patio of the restaurant so you can check into the sculpture gardens or buy your tickets there. I took my parents here and we enjoyed our meal tremendously. Service was on point, food was tasty, AND the view from the patio outside is worth going here for a meal. You can see Monet's bridge! Just keep in mind when it's lunch time it might get busy and backed up, but it IS French cuisine, so what do ya expect?! I also parked in the parking lot here and walked through Grounds for Sculptures and came back for my car later.","1706":"We stumbled across The Parish when visiting Tucson for Mother's Day Weekend. There's not too much near the Ritz Dove Mountain Resort so when this popped up on yelp we gave it a try. So glad we did!! \nWe were there for Mother's Day brunch and enjoyed the whole experience. We had the soft shell crab sandwich and the kids waffle. Both were great. The syrup is smoked and was SO good. We kept eating our son's meal who also enjoyed the waffle. The cocktails were great as well. \nAll and all I highly recommend. Reasonable prices, attentive staff, great food and solid cocktail selection. Will definitely be back again! Thanks for a memorable Mother's Day!","1707":"If in Tucson you must make a stop at the Parish. Great service, awesome food, reasonably priced. A shout out to Alexis \"our server\". Very attentive, engaging and personable.","1708":"NOTE: This review is written for a wedding I attended at Rat's last night (10\/10\/15), not on the main restaurant.\n\nFirst off, I wasn't thrilled with the logistics of the evening - wedding guests shouldn't have to walk 1\/2 a mile over a gravelly path to the ceremony venue (not good for the elderly and women wearing heels - they did have a golf cart but they probably needed at least one more). However, some the responsibility for this lies with the couple who chose this venue. They took an awful chance with the weather, and while it could have been much worse, it was quite chilly for an outdoor service and I heard a number of guests say they were cold.\n\nAs for the cocktail hour - it was excellent. They have an extremely well-trained staff and professional staff. It's always a good thing to have staff handing out cocktails as soon as you walk in through the door. I always have champagne and cocktails on a table by my front door when I have a party. The butler-passed hors d'oeuvres and table appetizers were delicious and the booze flowed freely. My only objection is that the music was way to loud to allow for pleasant conversation.\n\nAfter the cocktail hour, dinner took place on the second floor, which meant all the guests had to trek through the main restaurant and then upstairs. After dinner, it was all the way back down to the cocktail room for cake and dancing - just way too many moves for the comfort of many guests.\n\nNow for the main section of my review - Dinner. Now maybe again, because it was a wedding, although it shouldn't be, but I was very disappointed at what came out of the kitchen, especially since guests order off of a menu when they are seated - this is no \"check the box on your RSVP card and the food is prepared in advance. This was supposedly cooked fresh to order.\n\nWell, the first course, salad, was pretty skimpy and was made up of a mix of what I think was mesculin, spinach, raddicchio, frisee and what I'm guessing was red oak. I'm not as knowledgeable on salad greens as I should be, I guess.\n\nThe second course was a shredded pork ravioli with a light cream sauce. It was OK, but not anything super-special.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was the main course. I chose filet mignon, medium rare. It was served with what I'm estimating as a teaspoon of mashed potatoes spread out on the plate and about 1\/4 tsp. of some type of vegetable. Sadly, the steak was dry and flavorless. I sliced into the steak and there were no juices. The steak wasn't seasoned either, so some type of sauce (a reduction would have been nice) was definitely required. I ate about 5 bites and drained my water glass before declaring \"no mas.\"\n\nSo, in conclusion, it seems certainly possible for Rat's to earn 4 or 5 stars from me, but they weren't there last night. I'm giving 3 stars mainly for the tremendous staff. They were friendly, efficient and completely professional. I look forward to giving the kitchen staff an opportunity in the future to earn that 4th or 5th star.","1709":"Had a very good first visit to the Parish.  Two in our group got mixed drinks, both of which were great.  Abita beer on tap makes you feel like you are in Lou-Z-Anna.  Bacon popcorn was a hit, but hush puppies were cooked too long.  Gumbo was decent, not great.  The highlight was the shrimp and grits with greens.  Fantastic.  One person in our party got the pork chop, which was also very good.  \n\nMy rating overall might be closer to 3.5, but there's enough great items to get us back.  If you want a bar atmosphere with some good food selections, give it a try.","1710":"Welcome to the cutest french restaurant in Tucson. As you walk into this you are transformed into a Louisiana french cuisine hide a way. The bar displays amazing jars full of fresh fruit and crunchy cucumbers, laced with basil. That's not all that's in them, among the preserves they are drowned with bourbon, whisky, and vodkas. \n\nTonight we had the gumbo and quail. Fear not, the pricy price tag of $26 will provide you with two quail, a grit brick, and corn mixture. I recommend to pair both with the crystal hot sauce.\n\nWhile you wait I recommend the frog legs wrapped in bacon with an aioli. Entertaining yourselves by staring at the artwork and the price tags to match, but let's support local artist like Judy Alubowicz who's private collection is available upon request and gorgeous.","1711":"If you ever have a hankering for some very nice Cajun Creole this is the place to go. The drunken Angel was a nice change of pace for pasta even the pastor had flavor to it it was not bland at all.","1712":"Very limited seating other than barstools. BBQ was out of stock on our visit; must be good. Service was iffy, sometimes right on time, other times MIA. I enjoyed the food.","1713":"This is certainly as good as it gets- a completely relaxing and pampering experience - yes, pampering!. Amazing staff and service - they pop up the second before you were going to look for them. The food was delicious and after a stroll in the grounds this is the best place to kick back and relax. The Moroccan theme is outstanding with pops of turquoise and blue strategically placed. The outdoor seating was stunning with the view of a Monet painting. Our food was perfect - the steak hangers were juicy and just so tender with a delectable herb garnish. The crispy Grouper was amazingly balanced with grilled pineapple slices. The best part was the price -  bang for the buck in terms of service, food, taste, decor and hospitality. Loved it!","1714":"This is a MUST VISIT restaurant in Tucson! Highly recommended to us, and now Im highly recommending to everyone! Atmosphere was great, live music on Sunday added to it! Staff is friendly and professional. Prices for drinks are low, while prices for food might be higher to some people; but the food quality and quantity is phenomenal!\n\nA must try is the popular Drunken Pasta; very filling and deceiving (I ate less than half!). The bread that comes with the pasta is \"ok\", looks prettier than it tastes but I thought it was too greasy and hard. \n\nThe bacon wrapped frog legs were perfectly cooked, and whatever that sauce was; it was delish!!! \n\nCan't wait to go back:)","1715":"This place is amazing. My wife and I enjoyed this restaurant. Friendly staff and food from scratch","1716":"Go for the cornbread and stay for the Dutch wellwater. \n\nThere is a lot of seafood on the menu which I am not a huge fan of, unfortunately, but  revived rave reviews from my friends. The drinks though, the wonderful and well crafted drinks get me every time.","1717":"Delicious!  Thankful they didn't service mice or rats, just tasty flavor!  Saw some art too!","1718":"Food was not good. As a southern girl I expect big flavors and good food for somewhere that brandishes being from the south. Overall food lacked seasoning and salt. We also sat outside where there was a couple smoking which was pretty gross and turned us off of the whole experience. I ordered the red wine pasta and hush puppies both not good. Management agreed after test tasting the batter of hush puppies that the standard that night wasn't anything to write home about. However, I didn't like that the quality control was done at the expense of my palate. Overall wouldn't come back.","1719":"We came to Parish on a whim, my friend group loves southern food so we decided to celebrate a birthday. It was a Saturday night and it wasn't too packed so the five of us got seated quickly. The drink menu wasn't too impressive to me, I wish I would have asked to add some shots to the dry drinks since they seemed to have more exciting combinations. I got the Hand in a Hell Basket and it was okay! \n\nThe STAR of Parish is the food! Like wow! I got the Drunken Angel and the cornbread. Both were so amazing. The pasta was creamy and so well seasoned. That lobster broth is something special. I'm thinking about the leftovers now. \n\nThe only issue was the service. We went a little later and our waitress was so inattentive after our drinks were brought out. That was weird when it wasn't that busy at the time. \n\nI would definitely come back just not to celebrate something big.","1720":"Deceptively Plain Location Hides Great Restaurant\n\nA friend from Tucson and I dined at this restaurant during my recent visit to Tucson. When we pulled in to the strip mall where this restaurant is located I was struck by how little parking was available and we ended up parking around back near the dumpsters which wasn't a great start. Anyhow the food quickly made up for the homely setting. I had the best shrimp with cheese grits that I've had since I was last in New Orleans. The grits are firm and have a consistency more like cornbread. The portion of shrimp was generous (probably 8 or 9 shrimp) and they were firm and fresh. There was a bit of a kick to the seasonings. Wine by the glass seemed a bit pricey for the location, but matched the entrees well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.","1721":"A pretty impressive Cajun style gastropub.  The food has flavor and it's just spicy enough to be interesting but not overwhelming.  There are several menu staples, like the Drunkin Angel and the gumbo that are not to be missed.  They  have an extensive bar and many creative cocktail options. The appetizers are where the loose a star.  The price of the appetizers and what shows up once you order them  leaves you  questioning the value proposition of the order.  They're  small, simple and  pricey...?  I've worked my way through the appetizers over the last three visits to see if that changes based on what you order but it really does  not. Simply put, the food is great, the bar has a great selection but I'd skip the appetizers entirely.","1722":"The atmosphere was beautiful.  The decor was lovely too.  The food was underwhelming.  Seating for two was not intimate or private, I made reservations a week before going here and honestly I felt like I was dining with 4 people I don't know or care to dine with, the seating is too close.  This place is set up for larger parties.  The appetizer was  very good, Proven\u00e7al mezze, the eggplant was excellent.  I had the chicken salad, it was nothing special.  The lettuce was like rubber and the chicken was flavorless.  We also had the chicken schnitzel with a side order of frittes.  Again not much flavor in the dish and when we asked for salt, we never got it.  The bread and butter was very good.  I thought there would be specials not on the menu but the only add on was a soup.  There seems to be too much going on there,between the private events and people walking the grounds waiting for tables in the dining area, it was too busy for me and the main dishes lacked creativity and flavor.","1723":"I freaking love this place. I only went here once because it's about an hour drive from my house. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day. It's definitely one of the best tasting restaurant I've been to. Food is vey flavorful and texture was amazing- to me that is paramount. Ambience was calm and classy and the scenery and gardens is a sight to see. Of course, it's a highly rated restaurant and as a result the price is higher than most. We came here when I was 17. You can do it! I'd recommend the mussels! Oh and even the appetizer bread is to die for....ask for a sample of the spread!","1724":"Great food, drinks, and atmosphere. Come hungry! You will want to try everything. Hush puppies were amazing, pulled pork bbq was super yummy. Feeling brave? Try the frogs legs! Recommend making reservations as they are very popular. Looking forward to checking out the live music!","1725":"I grew up in Princeton, living at times around the corner from L'Hares.  After eating there once, I was turned off from alleged \"top end\" restaurants.  Thought it was over priced, pretentious  and mediocre.  \n\nThus my missing out for years on going to Rats, thinking all such places were all hype.  I got a gift certificate and it sat unused for over a year.  Finally, when going out with a new lady, I decided to use it.  We now try to go ever few months.  Exquisite!  Wow!\n\nThe service has been impeccable.  The food  has been tops.  Out of probably 50 dishes I've had there, 47 of them have been astoundingly good.\n\nThe only dish I've had better elsewhere is the filet mignon (better at KC Prime).\n\nI've also been to the breakfast brunch - also well worth it.","1726":"Very neat store! It is a boutique store with reasonable prices and unique items.\n \nThey stock their store with items that are difficult to come by elsewhere instead of just selling items you can easily find around town for boutique prices. They make an effort to put locally\/American made items in this store. Local supporting local makes the world go round. \n\nOn top of this, the owner is very nice. You can tell they are proud of the store, when I went there, they took the time to show me everything that makes them special. \n\nThe first time I went I had some difficultly finding it, and if I were better at directions I would give you some fantastic advice on how to get there... but really just use a Map app for directions and you're set! \n\nThis is  a great place to buy gifts for all occasions, don't forget Father's Day is coming up.","1727":"I had dinner at the Parish with two colleagues last night. And I think I can speak for our group, we enjoyed dinner very much. No pictures were taken but the portions were more than adequate and the presentations were very appealing!  What about the taste, you ask?  We had shrimp and grits, gumbo and their cheese burger. Each of us were very pleased!  And commented on the flavors and spices just being right. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for some business discussions mixed in with levity and hearty laughs. \n\nThe night was capped off with bread pudding for desert and that was a home run!\n\nThe service was friendly and relaxed. All in all, a wonderful dinner experience at The Parish worth coming back.","1728":"So very good. Was in Tucson for a conference where they were giving out samples of crispy pork belly on condensed watermelon (not a regular menu item).  After a few samples of that, I decided I needed to go to the restaurant for a full meal. It did not disappoint.  I was in a party of four and everyone loved everything - skillet cornbread (app), fish & chips (x2), mussels, and pork adobo sandwich were our selections. Service was also great - friendly and efficient. It's also a very cool\/funky decorated place inside.","1729":"Rat's Restaurant is a great visit for outside view and relaxing by a pond of water with awesome ambiance. Rat's is the restaurant on the Grounds for Sculpture in New Jersey. The sculpture gardens are a must visit, and the restaurant is a great relaxing place after walking the grounds. Where they lack is service; a little too impertinent for me. One should be able to stop and just order small plate with drink, enjoy and relax without attitude of \"oh is that all you want.\" Good wine list but overpriced. Food tasty but overpriced. Lucked out, best deal was appetizer mussels and they were delicious.","1730":"Came here for the first time Oct 2009 for lunch. We wanted to see outside-view looks pretty overlooking pond...but music restaurant was playing was too loud...the least loud spot was in the room with the bar...so we sat at the bar. The beer selection was good on tap and we ordered a German beer that was great...but pricey at 7dollars a glass. The waitress did a good job...but the cooks didn't. We order two salads...salad nicoise which they forgot to put the boiled eggs, there were no capers..instead old tomato. The bibb lettuce was fresh though. The farm salad had old over ripe avocado..and only a tiny piece...with old blue cheese that was past...we returned the farm salad...and they brought another one....this one was missing the avocado all together..the lettuce was bad in the second one looking like the soaked it in the water and wrung it out! The tomatoes were past and the blue cheese was more of the same...they just tried to cut of the parts that looked bad...the cooks told the waitress to tell us it was just that they forgot to remove the blue cheese rind!!! Whoever heard of blue cheese having a rind. The salad was just no good. I will not return to this restaurant again!","1731":"Drinks are good, and food is delish! I really enjoyed the live music last night. I waitress was super kind as well. We will be back!","1732":"We were seated promptly , informed of specials and left for or waitperson.\nThe waitstaff was excellent. Drinks came quickly, When it came  time to order the menu's were provided. promptly Nice touch! \n Attention when we needed to order, occurred instantly!  \n      Dad and I had the Hot Legs (frog legs wrapped in bacon), my first time. Skeptical, I bit into a wonderful morsel that exploded lots of flavor in my mouth! The  dinner was Fish and Chips for us both. The fish was fresh tasting and the batter was excellent and crunchy. No preponderant residual of grease, done just right. The fries are out of this world! Also done to perfection. I don't know who is running the kitchen but Kudos, man, Kudos! ( I don't care at all for Greasy foods)\nThe beer selection was thin for me, but excellent for Tucson's tastes. We had the Mirror Pond pale ale\/bottle. \nThe service was beyond reproach though! \nNever intrusive but always on the spot.It was like there was a captain for our table, plotting our dinner course. It was perhaps the most wonderful experience I have had in Tucson for some time. \n\nThe only critique I have to offer is to put some tinting 1\/2 way down the windows to cut the glare but keep the great ambiance!\n\nGreat work guys, ask your boss for more pay, cause I'm coming back and it's worth it.","1733":"On a cold and rainy Friday, friends from Cherry Hill and my husband and I met at Rat's for lunch.  It was so warm and welcoming inside - Mike and I had an Irish coffee at the bar while waiting for our friends and we warmed up right quickly with the atmosphere, the friendliness of the bartender and the delicious coffee.  When they got there, we were taken to our table in another room, looking out on the gorgeous, even in the rain, surroundings.  We had wine and the local cheese offerings as an appetizer, and delicious entrees for lunch.  The staff never hurried us, and we enjoyed a lovely afternoon.","1734":"The food AND drinks were amazing!!\nGreat ambiance for date night, and I've  recommended it to tons of friends.\n\nOnly complaint is my boyfriend and I were the only ones seated in our section, and it was right next to the door.\nAlthough I'm not one to be  picky about a seat, it made us feel a little unwelcome and isolated from everyone else.","1735":"Rarely do I come across food that is so delicious I literally cannot wait to go back. This is that place. I took my out of town friend to dinner last  night (her 1st time, my 3rd) and I cannot believe how good the food is. In the past I had ordered the Ruby Trout which is SO good  but I wasn't feeling it and had Shrimp n Grits this time. From the first bite I was in love. How can something be so simultaneously creamy, tangy, spicy, smoky and incredibly delicious. The collards greens rival anything I ever ate living in the south, the grit cake was both creamy and crispy, and I'm seriously here dying over the leftovers. My friend had Drunken Angel (also amazing) and a crazy spicy delicious cocktail with black salt that was beyond words. Stellar service too. I cannot wait to go back.","1736":"I love the Parish.  They have some of the best mixed drinks in town.  They also have Abita beer, which is my favorite brewery.  Their vegetarian options are amazing.  They've also added boiled peanuts as an appetizer.   Since I'm from the south, this is probably my favorite gastropub in Tucson.","1737":"OK the service is impeccable the food is amazing the pom fritz are to die for. The scenery around the deck outside where everybody should be sitting even though they had seating inside... Is amazing because of the grounds for sculpture Museum... This was my second time there within a year prior to this I had never been there and I'm an old man... I took my kids and they had a blast... Again I would highly recommend this place for anyone That wants to eat good healthy food and have a good time with great atmosphere...","1738":"I had to go to this store after finding them on Instagram! They kept posting too many great things that I just had to come in and check out. \n\nThe store is easy to find and there were no issues with parking. This is a small family owned business and the ladies are super sweet. Each time that I've been into Larkellen they have been helpful and knowledgeable about the products they are selling. A lot of the products are made locally. They are often getting new products into the store, so there is always a reason to go back. \n\nGreat place to buy gifts for men and women. It is also hard to leave without grabbing something for yourself!","1739":"Three things:\nFrog legs, drunken angel, gumbo\nDo these things and enjoy true happiness for a little while. \n\nWell worth the two hour drive. I will definitely come back. \n\nThe wall art is amazing. David M Ehlen is the artist. \n\nOne other thing, the French Fries are superb.","1740":"First visit at the Parish with friends. Great atmosphere, great service (waitress was great), and the food was great! I would recommend the popcorn, and cornbread. I had the Drunkin Pasta which I would highly recommend. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because our credit card got lost on the way to the kitchen for at least 15 min. The owner and waitress did come out and let us know they were searching for it, however I felt at that point the whole meal should have been free. Thankfully after about another 5 minutes, right before calling to get the card canceled  was found. Other than that, the place is wonderful.","1741":"My friends and I ate at The Parish restaurant, 6453 N. Oracle Road, Tucson, AZ  85704 in January 2019.  \n\nFood:  For appetizers we ordered the bacon popcorn, that I loved and the hushpuppies that were also very good.  \n\nTwo of us of us ordered the Slow Smoked BBQ Adobo Pork Bunhuggers with a side salad.   The pork sandwiches had an habanero aioli in the sandwich which made them so spicy hot that I could not taste the meat or anything else during the meal.  If you like spicy - that's the dish for you.  My friend also kept commenting how \"hot\" the sandwich was.  If I were to order it again, I would order it with the habanero aioli on the side.  \nOne other friend ordered the Cast Iron Cornbread, which she liked very much. \n\nService:  The waitress was very nice but she did not ask if we wanted anything to drink with our meals and it did not occur to us until after we started eating.  Once we were able to flag her down, we were able to get our drink order in.  The service was a bit slow, but we also had a lot to talk about so we did not feel rushed at all.  If you want a relaxed long dinner, this is the place. \n\nParking:  The restaurant has a large parking lot in front with plenty of parking.  \n\nAtmosphere:  The place was very clean and the noise level was very minimal.  A warm feeling with lots of wood everywhere.  We went on a Tuesday evening and it was definitely an older mature crowd.  \n\nConclusion:  The restaurant was quite full when we left so it appeared to be a local favorite.  I live on the far east side of Tucson (45 min.), so it would not be worth the drive for me to return.","1742":"So this place is located on the Grounds for Sculpture- you are able to access it walking from the park or you can drive to the entrance of the restaurant from the service road on the left side of the welcome center. \n\nCheck website for times but it did stay open past 6pm ( weekday) in which the welcome center etc closes. \n\nYou can sit outside on the patio marveling at the beautiful pond\/garden that resembles Monet's actual house and garden in Giverny, France. It's f'ing gorgeous!!!!  ( view is 5 stars) \n\nYou can also sit inside ( AC during the summer is refreshing lol). There is a dining area and a bar room. Decor is romantic and old fashioned. \n\nHappy hour is 4-7pm which was when I strolled in and I must say it was pretty crowded for a weekday.  Tried a cocktail (watermelon Sangria) which wasn't that great I must admit but it had ros\u00e9 and I'm not that fond of it - but I was so parched that I was willing to down anything with ice in it lol.  I should have tried wine because I tried a cheese plate Appetizer ( which I loved). You could chose from 3 cheeses and I opted for the blue ( yum) - came with nuts and cherry liquid jam. Bread and herb butter (shallot) was served with it \n\nStaff was super friendly and helpful\n\nI would like to return to have a full meal so stay tuned for that :) \n\nCheers darlings \nXoxo","1743":"Great food and service at every visit.  The shrimp and grit cakes are to die for.","1744":"Amazing views, good cocktails, and decent food.  For a restaurant inside a giant sculpture garden, this is the best available.  I took off a star for the maitre d's horrible nasty attitude - but once you get seated it is a 5 star experience.  The attitude didn't bother us, sometimes nasty angry workers are part of the entertainment of visiting New Jersey.  \n\nPrices are not great, $14 for a small cocktail, but way worth it if you can get a seat near the pond.  Try your best to sit outside.","1745":"Went there for a date. Loved the food (angels pasta is a must try), not so great service though. Had to wait for 20minutes even after having called earlier to make a reservation! That was kind of a mood spoiler. Apart from that, food and ambience was great","1746":"A fun barstaurant.  Well curated booze selection and cool cocktails.  Interesting food options, and not shy with the spices.  The food is very rich and filling, just the kind of food you want to enjoy while drinking.  I especially liked my gumbo.  The customer service was attentive.\n\nOn the flip side, I felt that the cocktails were a little overpriced, and me and my friend both had a upset stomach the next morning even though we had totally different food and just one drink.  My friend's angel hair dish should have been called \"drowned angel\" instead of drunken angel, it was considerably over-sauced, and with such spicy sauce that is not a good thing.\n\nBut I would give them another try.","1747":"Love the drink selection and boil peanuts\n\nFish and Chips are GREAT!\n\nGumbo I like but want shrimp (they'll add upon request)\n\nReservations highly recommended \n\nGets really crowded on music nights!","1748":"This was my third bad experience at this restaurant. My husband took me here today to celebrate my birthday. Our reservation was at 3:30; we arrived at 3:15. They were out of two main entrees from their limited Sunday Brunch menu:  Trout Almandine and Chicken and waffles. How can a restaurant be out of chicken?  WTF?  We had already ordered appetizers:  charcuterie and escargot. Neither was very satisfying or flavorful. We left. Appetizers and 2 brunch cocktails beat us out of $60. We left for Estia Taverna. \n\nOur prior visit took place about 6 years ago. I was gifted a membership to grounds for sculpture for a wedding gift. We were visiting the ground and thought we would catch a bite to eat during our visit. WRONG. No walk-ins. \n\nOur first encounter involved considering the restaurant for our wedding celebration. The person explaining the process and cost made it clear with his snobbish attitude that our business was not desired. We had a WONDERFUL wedding celebration at the Mercer County Boathouse. \n\nWe've decided not to try this place again. We're done.","1749":"Wonderful is all I can say.   Had an absolutely wonderful meal-starting with margaritas at the bar-the fried brussell sprouts were amazing- I could have eaten them as a meal.  Had scallops which were prepared to perfection.  desert was their fried donuts-OMG.  Can't say enough kind words on the service and attention given to us.   truly a wonderful experience.","1750":"Rat's once was a magical place but recently they've really dropped the ball (and apparently dropped the old chef).\n\nI've actually been to Rat's about 3 times in the past year (menu never seems to change)...but last night was the final straw.  \n\nLet's start with the Escargot. This is a CLASSIC French dish that is SO simple, it's almost impossible to screw up. I was served a generous portion of small, black, shell-less snail turds, freely rolling around a cast iron pan. I'm sorry but escargot do not belong in a cast iron pan. There is nothing \"rustic\" or \"lumberjack-chic\" about freakin' sea snails. They are a bougie food and should be served on a freakin' escargot plate. You know, the ones with little cups, so your snails stay contained and don't look like free-rollin'-turdletts? Also there was no pool of luscious garlic butter! It was so dry that some of my snails actually stuck to the cast iron. You know what would fix that? Butter...and not broiling escargot on a campfire flapjack pan. \n\nDespite the generous portion of snail turds, the Saturday night, $30 \"bouillabaisse\" special quite literally had 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, 3 mussels and 1 clam. That is 8 pieces of seafood for $30 in tomato broth (with no detectable saffron).  Pretty sure you'd get more mussels in the $15 mussel appetizer. Also, classic bouillabaisse is served with a little blob of roux on a slice of bread to stir into the sauce and make it thick. I kid you not, they actually put mayonnaise on the bread. I think that might actually be considered a hate crime against France. \n\nIf you're going to do an exclusively French menu features the classics, then do the classics REALLY well. There is literally no excuse why dishes with youtube tutorials can't be executed flawlessly by a professional kitchen. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, service has really slipped too. They're all nice guys but they need some refining. When people are spending a chunk of money on a dinner at a place considered to be \"fine dining\", they want it to be special. Our server last night disappeared when it was time for dessert, and when we finally flagged him down he said \"oh sorry, I'll be back, I have a very important call to make\". Really? I mean I know, servers are people too, but at almost $60 a head, I would have liked if our server to at least pretended he didn't have a life outside of the restaurant.\n\nTLDR: The ambiance is gorgeous but beyond that this restaurant has become undeservingly overpriced. Their execution of classic French dishes could actually start a war. \n\nIf you want French food done right, go to Manon in Lambertville. Jean Michelle's bouillabaisse is my gold standard.","1751":"If you're craving southern \/ cajun style cooking and drinks, the ONLY place to go is The Parish.  We had Hot Legs Le'Jean (bacon wrapped frog legs), Geudry's gumbo, and fried catfish.  The hush puppies are to die for, the gumbo is thick and slightly spicy, and the catfish and fries were cooked perfect!  The cornmeal batter is just like Mom's.  Thought the frog legs were a little over done, but seems that's how they do it.  Service was great.","1752":"We've been several times and used to think it was our go-to restaurant for special occasions. This last time disappointed and we probably won't hold it in the same regard. \n\nThe shrimp appetizer was fine but not amazing. They were out of the bottle of wine we ordered and when we sampled another, were given a less than clean glass. \n\nThe cod entree was cooked ok, slightly salty and the roasted potatoes served with it were horribly over salted. \n\nThe service has declined as well. I've had better at less formal restaurants. \n\nOverall, still a decent meal but no longer 5 stars in our view.","1753":"I love the food and the atmosphere but sometimes the service isn't the best. Last time I was here the waitress was rushing my friend and I the whole time. instead of enjoying our food and each other we felt rushed and uncomfortable.","1754":"Without a doubt a must try!! Bartenders are friendly and knowledgable with craft cocktails that will have you experiencing spirits you may have never tried!! The gumbo and house fries were all i had room for and both were outstanding. I will be returning to sample the rest of the menu one meal at a time.","1755":"This place is literally picture perfect. If you get to dine outside when it is warm, you will likely see newlyweds taking wedding photos in the woods. You will also be graced with a visit by the swans and ducks that live in the ponds as you eat. The waterfall is a sight for sore eyes and you can walk around and enjoy the artwork and sculptures after you eat. It's truly an experience you won't forget. The food is french and served by friendly waiters. I can't wait to return.","1756":"We had a variety of different foods. Frogs legs were very tasty as well as the hush puppies. I don't remember all the things we ordered because my son-in-law ordered and he is from Mississippi.","1757":"Was a really good find.  Thanks Yelp, not expecting a good bowl of gumbo on our way back from the desert museum.","1758":"You've seriously got to try the bacon buttered popcorn. An order comes out in a heaping bowl with enough to share...or so you think. It could never be enough! Absolutely delicious! The table water is tasty too.","1759":"Cool eclectic neighborhood restaurant. Not afraid to express their individuality in both the interior decor but most importantly the food. I had the crispy fish and chips that came as advertised. Wife had the drunken angel pasta dish- which she loved but said the sauce was very rich. \nThe non-alcoholic cranberry mule was super a tasty and creative pre dinner beverage. If we lived here this would definitely be in regular rotation. \nFood done well.","1760":"Fabulous!......came here for an early \"'Mother's Day Brunch\"....as to avoid traffic next week.....staff was wonderful and made my 2 little girls and mother feel very special......we had a wonderful table with a lovely view of the lake....buffet selection was incredible....well worth the price......absolutely best eggs benedict I've ever eaten! Will definitely be back.","1761":"There is not one thing I dislikes about this French influenced restaurant. The setting was artistic and I felt like I was dining at Monet's pond.the dinner was so tasty and prepared well! Escargot was tender and I had forgotten how much I liked them! The service was attentive, not intrusive. Fine dining on the Grounds for Sculpture!","1762":"mixes of Louisiana Cuisine tucked away near Orange Grove and oracle.  families and couples welcome and comfortable there.  tasty delicious and interesting. I recommend this resturant highly!","1763":"I ate at the Parish for the first time last night (Sunday). The restaurant has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The restaurant was very clean. The food was outstanding! If you love, like or are interested in tasting some good southern (Cajun, Creole, home style southern food) with an interesting twist then this place is for you! I had their Gumbo with Crawfish Hushpuppies...it was amazing! The portions are good size. I was hoping to try their bread pudding for desert but was too full from the main course. They also have live music on Sunday evenings and also on Fridays. They have a Sunday Brunch that sounds very good. The place can be slightly expensive once you factor in adult beverages and an appetizer but all in all it is worth it. I'll definitely be back!","1764":"Been wanting to try this place out. Finally made a stop the other night. We enjoyed the place. Kinda funky. Staff easy going & friendly. It was a week night. The place was about 3\/4's full. Busy, but not crazy nuts. The better half had the pretzels and a bowl of gumbo. Your humble author had a cup of gumbo and the steak salad. All tasty. Can't wait to go back.","1765":"Good food and great drinks! The Parish offers something new and unique and for us, it was an enjoyable experience. Really liked the Black & Blue Brussel sprouts and the Verlasso Salmon. Yum! Just FYI, this place is not that big, get there early and expect to wait a few minutes. But, it's definitely worth it!","1766":"Ok, it helps that the place is right across the street from work. But this is the BEST place for happy hour right now. They have quite a few different kinds of beer which is great, the drinks are pretty cheap and really clever and the food that I've had so far there has been delish. The bacon popcorn at $3 a pop is a must have. The french fries could be a meal themselves. 3 of us split the fries and could barely eat anything else after that. The lamb chorizo is a little spicy but it's a cajun place so I asked for it! My fave is the gumbo. Slow clap. Hats off. Deep bow. All that stuff. I could eat it three times a day.  The hush puppies are fantastic, like seriously good. \nNext on my list is to try out the wings and I am pretty sure it won't dissapoint!\nOh, and if you can't make happy hour they do take out for lunch.","1767":"I live right around the corner from Rats, and although I've walked through Grounds for Sculpture many times, never stopped into the whimsical restaurant next door. \nOn Valentine's Day (also our anniversary), the boyfriend and I miraculously managed to get a last minute reservation. We ate in the Moroccan room, which is home to the bar (not complaining!) and beautiful decor. We were seated at a very nice table looking out into the sculpture garden. For larger parties (about 4-6) there is a nook with pillows on the floor beside a fireplace which I can't wait to try out sometime.\nWe had the Valentine's tasting with wine pairings- everything was out of this world! There were some shrimp that were a bit spicy for my taste which our server insisted on replacing to accommodate my delicate sensibilities (lol). The local cheese selection paired with a petit syrah was incredible- they must have a very talented sommelier. I wish I could recall our server's name, he was very attentive, knowledgable, accommodating and very sweet & charismatic to boot! Will absolutely be back in the near future.","1768":"We went here for a late Valentine's Day dinner and it was great. The food is amazing, the service is exactly what you'd like. They still had their Valentine's Day prefix menu available with a wine pairing, we chose to pick our meal. We had the mussels and pommes fritte first. The mussels were maybe the best I've ever had... THE SAUCE! So clean and juicy. Then we were given complimentary pop overs that our waiter Steve hyped up quite a bit, and it was TRUE. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and still warm! For dinner I had the short rib which was cooked to perfection. I would only add another pickled cucumber to cut the spice of the sauce. My boyfriend had the duck and cleaned his plate (it was delicious). We didn't have dessert because we were too full, but we were given complimentary coffee madelines which was the perfect way to end. I will absolutely be back!","1769":"Probably the worst most expensive salad I have ever had. The restaurant is gorgeous and the ambiance is wonderful but the food is overpriced and awful. Their menu online doesn't match what they currently have on their menu, so for someone who is gluten free (and saw many gluten free options on the online menu) was the first let down. Got there and only had a few options, but decided to try one of the veryyy pricey salads. It was just a few wilted leaves thrown on a plate with pieces of chicken scattered around. Really disappointed after a $100+ lunch","1770":"Gets one star even though I've never been inside.  Waited till 11:10 for their lunch opening, nobody answered our knocks even though the TV was on over the bar.  Left and went across Oracle to Oregano's where we had a nice lunch.  It might be a good place, but if you can't get in when they're supposed to be open - who knows???","1771":"I went and sat at the bar. As the only person at the bar it should have been easy to get service. Not so much. I waited over 10 minutes to be greeted or even told \"hello\". The male bartender tossed a menu to me and proceeded to do his side work I think. Two more guest arrived, they were warmly welcomed and offered a drink immediately. The food is always great that's why I went in the first place, too bad I can't get good service when I'm there! Maybe next time the kitchen staff can serve me. Good Luck Parish!","1772":"Amazing cocktails, frog legs, and service! This is one of my favorite spots to visit whenever I am in Tuscon!","1773":"Popped into this little hipster, live music gastropub while visit Tucson. They have a limited menu after 10pm, so we had only a few things to choose from. The frog legs looked interesting, but they were all out of those. So we got crawfish hush puppies instead. There were just ok. Kind of on the dry side. We got burgers and those were really tasty!! Our server was the only one working and it was busy so it took quite some time to get our drinks, food and bill.","1774":"Great frog legs! Was great and look forward to going back. Didn't get to hear the live music, so hopefully next time!","1775":"Was spending an overnight in town for work when I happened upon this joint. Cram packed on a Tuesday night...good sign. Ate at the bar. Very friendly bar staff. Ordered the cornbread appetizer. It was served in a six inch iron skillet with a pumpkin butter which was cool. After I took my first bite my first thought was to order another skillet's worth. Wow--not like any cornbread I've ever had. It was terrific. Had the gumbo plus shrimp for my main course and it was great. It could have been a little hotter temp wise but damn, really good. Go there and enjoy yourself. Nice, fun staff and terrific food.","1776":"The food is absolutely unbelievable! Every single thing we have tried so far has been delicious. I recently took my family from out of town and they all loved it as well. It's a great environment and I love the eclectic style and art. This place is definitely a must visit! It will not disappoint. 100% recommend.","1777":"I have been to The Parish about 5 times over the past year and can say this place is now my \"go to\" restaurant! The service is excellent and consistent. The food never fails to impress and leaves me wanting to come back again and again.  The ambiance is intimate and unique. Everything I've tried has been a great experience but the bacon popcorn appetizer is a MUST! I'm not a fan of bacon-flavored foods but this is so well done! Hot and fresh salty popcorn with just a touch of bacon flavor and tiny bits of bacon mixed in. Don't miss this!","1778":"Excellent!  Went during week for lunch and the food was wonderful as well as she setting and gardens.  The dinner menu pricing is same just some different variations of some items and some additional items.  Yes the drinks are manhattan priced but hey it's NJ!  Will return and the grounds are spectacular.","1779":"This time the crawfish hushpuppies, frog legs, drunken noodles, raw oysters and steak (sauce on it) were really good.","1780":"Such a cool place! Try happy hour at the bar or dinner in their formal dining room you won't be disappointed","1781":"Visited for brunch a few months back. The restaurant is whimsical, the service good and the brunch buffet had a good selection of food which was all well prepared. I can vouch for the bloody Mary's as well. After a lovely walk through the grounds, we we returned at the end of the day for another delicious cocktail.","1782":"Over priced admission. Over priced restaurant prices. Very Poor customer service. Refused to seat us without a reservation at 11:30 AM in the morning! Then told us we could be seated but would have to leave at 1:00 PM.  Seated us at bar. Front desk is in a daze.   Perhaps the nose rings are interfering with their brain waves? Bar tender too busy to cater to  customers at bar because he is servicing bar and restaurant waiters\/customers. Watched 5 tables sit idle  Girls at front desk and manager are NOT customer focused. When asked why so many empty tables and couldn't we be seated at one, girl at front desk was LOUD while explaining that, \"we take reservations you know\". We asked for manager who explained his troubles that day. Servers called in sick therefore a dining room could not be opened. Interesting concept, however food is way overpriced, and the requisite customer service is missing.  Brochure lists wrong (much lower)  pricing for admission than what you pay at gate. Buses of unsupervised foreigners running rampant through the grounds screaming and yelling, blocking sidewalks and passageways. And watch where you step! There is peacock poop everywhere.","1783":"This restaurant is now among the Pantheon of my favorite restaurants. A lucky find when I was in Tucson for a wedding, I will forever be desirous to return to The Parrish. Everything from the cocktails to the french fries to the dipping sauce and every entree was simply killer. I was only in Tucson for 4 days and my girlfriend and I went back twice.","1784":"Excellent place. The ambience along with the food is outstanding. The service is great and it was overall a great experience!","1785":"We have yet to find a restaurant in Arizona that serves southern cuisine which actually compares to real southern food, until this one!  I would eat here for every meal if I could. Every thing we ordered was spot on!  Our service (server Meredith) was perfection!!  This is a must stop restaurant.","1786":"Really disappointed. Went for Easter brunch and ordered the special: Horchata roasted rabbit with mole blanco, chile spiked carrot confit and frijoles rancheros. Rabbit had nice cinnamon spice (kind of like horchata I guess) but was over cooked and dry. \"Carrot confit\" consisted of four very small nickle-sized pieces of carrot--though they were sitting in a nice green spicy sauce, it was somewhat of a shock just how few carrots were on the plate. Frijoles rancheros were actually large white lima beans scattered on the plate--decently cooked but somewhat bland. Mole sauce was decent and presentation was nice with edible flowers. \n\nOverall this dish was a major let down for $30. Others at the table ordered other dishes and were satisfied. I've been to The Parish before and had a good experience--this fell very flat. Saving grace was the cocktail, as usual.","1787":"I love this place. I've only been here a few times but it has always been a great experience. The food is phenomenal, the service is superb, the drink selection is extensive and the experience spectacular! I aways and will to continue to suggest The Parish to my friends.","1788":"This place was an amazing find! My boyfriend surprised me with reservations here for today; we went for lunch - it's a very quiet, calm, romantic atmosphere, and everyone there seemed very nice. The food is AMAZING- from the bread to the drink list (I got hot cider... Perfect taste) to the entrees and desserts. We got the braised rib and the roast turkey sandwich- both were to die for! The short rib melts in your mouth! The turkey has chutney which gave it amazing flavor! The table we were seated at had a couch as our seats which was amazing, comfortable, and secluded. We loved every aspect of this restaurant -- staff, ambiance, and food (and the price is not bad at all for what I would call a 5 star restaurant!). We  definitely will be back!","1789":"Love this place. The employees, the owners, and the food are wonderful. Cocktail prices are a little high for this place, but are good!","1790":"Really great food, but it's inconsistent just like everything else in Tucson. \nThe service can be good, but they definitely don't go above and beyond. \nNot sure if it's worth the price.","1791":"Great food period. For the quality of food provided, I think the price point is not too high. There is some real art not only in the presentation but also the composition of the food. Love the atmosphere and seating options, and also love how even when it is crowded, I still have my personal space.\n\nHad the frog legs, quail, and tried the NY steak. All were excellent. Frog legs were not over cooked, and maintained the flavor of frog legs. Quail was beautifully seasoned and had bold but complex flavors. Steak was cooked to perfection, and had just the right amount of flavor to not overcome but complement the steak. Though this place is expensive for the average Tucsonian, it is definitely a bargain for the quality and comfort.","1792":"I really wanted to like this restaurant because it is unique in Tucson.  There are no other Tucson cajun restaurants that I know of.  The decor was interesting and the wait staff was so friendly and helpful.  But alas, the food was not good.  Hubby ordered Drunken Angel (a house specialty) which was Burgundy angel hair, shrimp, crawfish, lobster broth, saffron red pepper cream sauce, fresh parmesan.  He didn't like the flavor and the purple angel hair pasta just had a horrid look.  It came with garlic bread that was boring.  How in the world can a place make two pieces of garlic bread BORING?  But it was.  I ordered \"World's Crispiest Fish & Chips\".  What a huge disappointment.  Where shall I begin.  The fish had a musty odor.  It was as if the batter in which they fried the fish had sat in my dead grandmother's closet a month prior to being used. That was the odor and taste.  And it was not in the least bit crispy.  It was served atop a pile of the limpest french fries I've ever eaten half of which were burned.  I also ordered a cup of their gumbo to try.  I was told that it was made from a 100-year-old recipe.  Within that cup was a small pile of stuck together rice, but the worst part was a very HARD clump of rice that coated the bottom of the bowl.  Even a knife could not cut that stuff.  Terrible.  Additionally, we tried their plain hush puppies.  They tasted good, but they were black in color.  And they gave us fish tartar sauce in which to dip them.  The real kicker was the price.  We had ordered from the LUNCH menu and the bill for two came to $55!  That's kind of steep for lunch.  We will never go back.  Blech.","1793":"We had a great lunch with just appetizers (frog legs wrapped in bacon, baked oysters with blue cheese and bacon, and bacon popcorn). Finished it off with delicious bread pudding.","1794":"We came here for a late lunch after spending the day at the beautiful Grounds for Sculpture. This place was highly recommended by a couple of people that had been to the area before.\n\nThe building in which the restaurant is located and the interior are just simply amazing. I was in awe walking around and admiring every decoration and the ambiance of the restaurant. My favorite little feature was a picture frame with a live feed of one of the sculptures on the grounds which I'm sure has captured some people posing inappropriately with it, unknowingly being monitored.\n\nAll of the wait staff were friendly and all cracked jokes with us as well. The lunch menu was unfortunately pretty limited. Wanting something healthier, the waiter suggested I get the seafood salad for my meal. The calamari was tender and cooked wonderfully, and they did not skimp out on the seafood. The fried shallots on top and the vinaigrette tossed with it tied everything together perfectly. My mom got the french dip sandwich, and this is the only reason why I didn't give Rat's 5 stars. The sandwich and aus jus were both ice cold. I've never had a cold french dip before, and since both were cold, I believe it was intentional. Still, the flavor was good and Mom ate the entire sandwich. For dessert, we order the walnut brownie sundae to share. The presentation was beautiful, and it came with brownie crisps along with the delicious featured walnut brownie; a perfect cap to our great meal.\n\nI enjoyed our experience here. As we left, the restaurant was setting the tables for dinner, which appeared to be a classier affair. I would love to come back here and give dinner a shot next time.","1795":"I've been wanting to try this place for months, but something always came up. Today, was my daughters birthday and she wanted to go there to celebrate and I must say it was a great choice. Like others have said, the employees are all fantastic, friendly and very warm in every way. The food was wonderful and the prices are more than fair for what you get. Quality is great, amount of food is more than adequate (plenty for a doggy bag). We had the crawfish hush puppy's, the drunkin Angel and the bread pudding. It was all a taste treat. We can't wait to go back for something new.","1796":"Omg try the mussels - you ll never have a better version! Chill vibe and the food is great! We always go for multiple smaller plates versus a meal and never lets us down!","1797":"Love this place! There's always great gift ideas here and the store is full of Nevada and Tahoe related items. I love that they support other small businesses too! Super cute boutique--I could spend hours checking out everything they have!","1798":"If you have an hour in Tucson, don't waste your time anywhere else. Come straight to the Parish. Best place in town, hands down. Make sure to have the Drunken Angel pasta; it will change your life. Also had the bacon-wrapped frog legs and shrimp po boy, which were excellent. Excellent service and ambiance, as well. Easily the best service I've had in the last year. Don't miss it!","1799":"Their food is classic French American \nPretty good food, trout is delicious ! \nShort rib is definitely something to go get ! \n\nAlso a walk through the grounds adds to the experience of dining at Rats! \nThey also make all their desserts in house and their pastry department is skilled in all walks of tasty treats! \n\nThey also have a hamburger that tops local establishments, cooked perfectly with fresh lettuce tomatoes and onions cut before playing ! \n\nOn Sunday, they have a\nBrunch that will knock your socks off, a spread of amazing delicious food from Prime Rib, to fresh shrimp cocktail and made to order omelette station. \nDefinitely suggest getting the family together and going down on a Sunday!!","1800":"Excellent. Took my 87 year old mom here for her birthday.  Was a great way for her to enjoy the garden in a restful environment.  The food it outstanding and the service top notch","1801":"The Parish is truly delicious every time! They have excellent cocktails and I'm always hard pressed to decide which delicious concoction I'm going to chose this time. The food is excellent! The goat cheese chili relleno is like an upscale version of a jalape\u00f1o popper but infinitely more delicious. My favorite is always the shrimp and grits. I never thought I would love grits but I truly do! Their collard greens are also something I never thought I would say I love but they're truly so good! If you're looking for a nice restaurant to meet some friends, go on a date or to treat yourself to a nice dinner this is it!","1802":"Amazing well-crafted drinks and fantastic atmosphere along with cool AF decor. Stopped in for a couple of drinks while we waited to meet family for dinner in the area. Sat at the bar and were treated well by the bartenders who are fun to watch perform their craft. We had heard a lot of things about this place but never remembered to make a point to come here. Definitely going to be back ASAP.","1803":"The food was great this is a very nice date night Location excellent service. I wish the North West  had  more upscale restaurants with great customer service.","1804":"Wow...Love this place. We got Shrimp and Grits...side salad and fries and sauce ...all excellent...","1805":"I'll preface by saying that Rat's is one of my girlfriend and I's favorite restaurants.  We've been here four times already and each time is perfection.  From the moment you drive onto the grounds you are whisked away to a fantastical culinary world, leaving all of your troubles behind.  The restaurant is set on a gorgeous 42 acre sculpture park that takes ambiance to a whole new level.  \n\nAs you make the fantastical trip up the driveway and walk through the doors of a stagecoach (yes I said stagecoach), you are transported into a space thats furnishings can most accurately be described as \"wind and the willows.\"  Rest assured that there is not a bad seat in the house at this two story restaurant.  Every inch is a romantic visual assault on the senses.  From host to waitstaff, everyone is polite, attentive and you can tell they want to make your dining experience unique and exceptional.  \n\nOnce seated, we were treated to bread service and our choice of a variety of assorted breads with salted butter that is to die for. For an appetizer we normally get the cheese plate.  It's a diverse selection of cheeses that will appease even the most difficult of cheese connoisseur' palate's.  For entrees, the menu is seasonal so depending on the time of year you go the options we had may or may not be offered.  I've tried both the diver scallop and the seared duck breast (those of you who have read my previous reviews know that duck is one of my go to dishes).  The duck breast was accompanied with duck fat Brussels sprouts (divine) and swish chard bread pudding.  The duck was succulent and the accompaniments fit the dish nicely. The diver scallop was accompanied by cauliflower and a blood orange Gastrique.  It was tender and perfectly cooked. Portion sizes were perfect, you won't leave hungry. For dessert we always get the creme Brulee.  It's mandatory.  Trust me.\n\nCocktails are inspired and refreshing and they will work with you on making a drink that fits your sensibilities.  All in all, you'll spend around $120-140 per person at Rat's including cocktails.  Reasonable for the outstanding meal and experience you will have here.\n\nI recommend dining in the evening, it isn't advertised, but after dinner take your cocktails, head outside via the back entrance and take a moonlit stroll through the sculpture garden.  It's a truly unique experience that you'll only get at Rat's.  The sculptures are all illuminated, as is the path to see your way and after a few drinks it's even more thrilling.\n\nI can't recommend Rat's enough.  It is one of my favorite dining locations.  Go see for yourself and you can thank me later.","1806":"Super tasty New Orleans style food. Great atmosphere. We had a group of 8 people and had a great time. Wait staff were good and food was prompt. I recommend it.","1807":"Excellent meal and service!  Will def come here again. I had the Dutch baby and hubby had chicken and waffles. Both were outstanding. Their hot sauce is to die for!  Can't wait to try other things.","1808":"This is my second time dining at Rats. Both times I will say the food did not disappoint. The only issue I had was the French fries were beyond salty, to the point eating for than 10 was impossible. The trout on the other hand was delicious and delicate. I would highly recommend dining outdoors, the experience is so much nicer with the pond, all the beautiful koy fish and sculptures all around. Do not come to grounds for sculptures without experiencing Rat's!","1809":"Entering the restaurant the first thing you'll find is a fun New Orleans style aesthetic--cool and dark which is a great way to get out of the heat.\n\nThe portions are generous and the choice are varied and unique. Give the bacon popcorn a try, decadent for sure but oh so yummy. Perfect for sharing.\n\nParish also features live music three nights a week and special holiday menus.","1810":"Great food! We got the cornbread and goat cheese rellano for starters and I got the Parish burger and my husband got the shrimp and grits. All of it was delicious! Will definitely come back!","1811":"What a cool taste of NOLA in Arizona.   The drunken angel is not to be missed.   Also enjoyed the Extra crispy fish and chips.  Finished it off with decadent bread pudding.","1812":"Sooooo... Chef Travis continues to crank out his verion of southern cusine. Dont miss the drunken angel pasta, it is to die for... seafood is fresh and I swear you will want to get a bowl of the sauce and drink it. It is that good! Bacon popcorn ohhhhh baby, if you like popcorn and love the pig like i do, dont miss this appetizer, EVERY piece tastes like bacon cuz the pop it in bacon grease! Another on of my favs is the shrimp n grits, again sauce is OUTSTANDING, shrimp are sweet n delish. Plus the deep fried grits are creamy n crunchy delicious love! Then just finish with bread pudding... enough said... JUST GO!!!","1813":"I've been here several times and am always impressed with the variety and quality of their food.","1814":"We went for lunch on an early Sunday afternoon.  They took our name, and phone number so that we could be called as we walked around outside during our wait.   We were told our wait time would be 45 minutes, and ended up being only 25 minutes.  We were seated inside, at a table right next to the door leading to the outdoor dining.  Loved the upholster chairs!  Our waiter was Dillon. Need very professional and knowledgeable.  \n\nFood was very good.  I had the \"Croque Madame\".  Portions, pretty much what I expected, and were fine with me.\n\nLove the whole atmosphere\/decor of the place.\n\nMy only disappointment was that it used to be you eat in the restaurant, the diners  then got free admission to Grounds for Sculpture (a must see), which sit on the same property.  Although, I am told they did away with that a few years back.  Unfortunate, but we still paid to walk the grounds following our meal.","1815":"The food was delicious and service outstanding.  Our waitress was funny and attentive,  while not over staying at the table to chat.  The steak was perfectly cooked, chicken was flavorful and the drinks were mixed by a pro.  The prices are high, but the meal and dining experience was well worth it.  \n\nWe only had 30 min before our reservation so only got to see some of the grounds.  I do think they should be complimentary  (its 25$ per person) for patrons.  The statues are so life like!\n\nAll in all I would definitely go again...","1816":"If you are in need of a well thought out gift this is your place because they have a lot of unique items. But I will say their products are so overpriced. I don't think I will be visiting again.","1817":"Finally made it to try the Parish for a birthday dinner last month! \nBacon Popcorn- Delicious! \n\nI had the spicy crawdad etcetera pasta- super delicious, but very rich (be warned). \n\nWe also had orders of the gumbo, shrimp grits, and fish and chips. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals. Great portions and fun atmosphere. \n\nDefinitely try this place out when you get a chance and have some fun money to spend as it is a little pricier.","1818":"It was my first time going there today. Delicious mezze and herb butter. Potato leek ravioli was just ok. Great service!! Would go back if I am the that area.","1819":"I've dined at Rats many times, including their New Year's Day Brunch. \n\nAll the meals that I have had here have been good.  I had one criticism of this particular visit. I felt for the price of each entree, the portion size was small and nothing was served alongside. I ordered the flounder and it was a very thin piece of fish with 3 little potatoes and a few beans. My husband ordered the pork schnitzel and it came with a tiny bit of cole slaw. However, if you want to treat yourselves for a special occasion, Rat's is a nice option and this particular visit does not sway my 4-star rating.  \n\nAmbiance: For me, this is the main draw to this restaurant.  I'm transported to a different time and place; the landscape, flora and sculptures are breath taking.  The entire scene lends itself to amazing photographs. I love the peaceful and serene environment created here.  If you have time, go visit the adjoining Grounds for Sculpture which is amazing as well.\n\nFood:  The food is expensive, but think of it as part entrance fee to roam about the gardens at Rats (in nicer weather, of course).  Considering the pricey menu, the Brunch is reasonably priced. The desserts on this particular visit were awesome!\n\nService:  Service has been very good with friendly and efficient staff.\n\nSpecial Events:  Rats throws some great special events throughout the year including a Dance Club Night, Salsa Night, and a Halloween Party.  I've attended all of them and have had an amazing time at each.  The events do get quite crowded.","1820":"One of the best meals of my entire 56 year life! Food was not only delicious, but was in very generous portions.  I had the Tchoup ....hubby had Gumbo ... we both enjoyed both meals as we kept sharing!  And the Bacon Popcorn?  Where has this been all my life???? So yummy.   But the very best part of the evening was our server Jess.  She made this change from a meal in a restaurant to an experience over a meal.  She was 100% knowledgeable of the menu, helped us navigate for food allergies, and had the very best sense of humor!","1821":"I guess my first mistake was not having a screaming toddler with me on Mother's Day.  We were promptly seated, this will be the only thing that happened in a timely manner. We waited for close to 25 minutes to SEE a waiter. He acted like he was a waiter for another table and seemed shocked that we had not been waited on (we figured out a little later that he was actually our waiter).  Over an hour after being seated we received our meal. Now, if they were packed I would have been more forgiving, but they were at most, steady. There were no lines out the door or people waiting for a long time to be seated. \nThe food,  let's start by saying the \"Featured Items\" had no price. I'll get back to that later. My wife ordered Duck confit with waffles (recommended) and I had the Drunken Angel pasta dish. They looked really good, but that is all I can say that is nice. Pasta...over cooked and it had a taste of uncooked burgundy, seafood...overcooked and this dish is far too rich. The Duck Confit...the meat was good but the skin was burned because it was left under the salamander too long.  This also caused the waffle to be super dry. \nOverall, this was a true disappointment. Especially when we received the check. For one waffle and one duck leg we paid $28. If this was a truly delicious meal I could care less, but we paid that price and it was a terrible experience. By the time we left we had been there for one hour and 45 minutes. I left with a feeling of utter disappointment. I had so hoped we had found a new place to go on weekends. \nNormally, we are very happy diners, but The Parish let us down.","1822":"$17 for the smallest bowl of gumbo, maybe a cup? Yeah it tasted good, but $17 for half a meal. Left unfulfilled. This is soul food for upper middle class white folks. $17, look at the size......","1823":"We have been here quite a few times since they opened. As fans of Cajun and Cajun influenced food, it is a good (maybe only) stop for us in the Tucson area. It has a nice atmosphere, although it can get to be noisy (is there a restaurant that isn't anymore?), as the dining area is right adjacent to the bar. There is a nice little private area that would be great for eight people, however we have never had enough cronies with us to reserve it. Some of the items on the menu are top drawer and others less so. We like the Drunken Angel probably the best. The Gumbo is very good too, when they dig down in the pot and give you lots of seafood (tell them). The Gumbo comes with excellent corn bread. But we caution you on the spice. Cajun food is by nature quite spicy, but we find the spices quite variable with each visit. Sometimes it will water your eyes, other times it is perfect.","1824":"Ahhh man what can I say?! It's definitely a place I would visit everytime I'm in Tucson. Quite possibly the best meal I've had out here. Theres a relaxing Southern vibe soon as you enter. I can picture a live band playing here on weekends. \n\nI ordered the basil and watermelon cooler and it was very refreshing. It was light but flavorful. Perfect for the summertime. I could sip on those all day poolside. For my meal I had the red trout with collard greens. I'm very picky when it comes to soul food due to my moms southern cooking during the holidays but these collard greens were so good I had to text my mom immediately after the first bite. They definitely rival hers. You can tell that they chef isn't afraid to season the food well. The red trout was delectable as well. They matched perfectly with one another. \n\nThe service was quite exceptional as well and I would definitely come back and spread the word when I return home. This is one restaurant that won't be forgotten. \n\nBtw ask for the watermelon flavored hot sauce that is very good!","1825":"Don't waste your time here. The food is not good and the service is equally horrible. Was disappointed to say the least","1826":"OK the service is impeccable the food is amazing the pom fritz are to die for. The scenery around the deck outside where everybody should be sitting even though they had seating inside... Is amazing because of the grounds for sculpture Museum... This was my second time there within a year prior to this I had never been there and I'm an old man... I took my kids and they had a blast... Again I would highly recommend this place for anyone That wants to eat good healthy food and have a good time with great atmosphere...","1827":"Service was really bad. Our waitress kept forgetting our coffee and she didn't write down our order. We waited and hour and fifteen minutes late. It took us 20 minutes for them to bring out a cheese board. I'm sorry but cutting a piece of cheese does not take that long. The waitress gave us attitude once we told her we were leaving. She literally ignored us and gave the table next to us their food before us. Never coming here again for food. Sculpture garden is cute but the restaurant is not worth it.","1828":"First time, for me and mother\nthe service is very good the food is excellent I will definitely be back!","1829":"The setting is nice (outside).  Inside is pretty frenetic and loud.  3 of our 4 dishes were good (Steak Frites, Scallops, French Dip).  The Duck Salad was so salty you couldn't swallow it.  The servers were horrible.  Didn't speak understandable English.  The guy who cleared crashed dishes and totally intruded on us offensively (and intentionally).  I wouldn't go back.","1830":"I gave it a third try, cause I wanted to like the place, yes... it's great inside, kinda small, great ambiance and live music.  The food is just ok, the gumbo not very good, and I say on the verge of being better, but they haven't gotten there,  I have played music there, people are great and the owners are very nice, I see mixed reviews here.  I have been to some great places for New Orleans food, in Chicago, and I can tell you their food falls short, sorry to say, again, I like the place.  Some may disagree with me, but again, I'm from Chicago were the food is fantastic....","1831":"Fantastic. The food is wonderful the setting is beautiful. We had lunch there with a party of 7 and everyone was impressed. I definite 5 star experience","1832":"Finally had a chance to try The Parish, and even during the time of covid curbside pickup. It was super busy for curbside but well run. We ordered 2 Parish Burgers with fries. The wait was about 20 minutes and the gal walked it out to the car. The burgers are huge and absolutely delicious! Blue cheese, bacon, red onion marmalade (amazing), and Dijon. The fries were delicious too and also came with a pickle spear. Only miss was no napkins included in the bag and they are large juicy burgers. Luckily we had some already in the car. Looking forward to trying more on the menu.","1833":"Right at the heartof Grounds for Sculpture. This is a hidden gem. Excellent ambience! Food? Okay to average. Not authentic french it's an American \/Italian\/French fusion.Service is world class. The artsy ambience makes it a perfect date place. Pricey but the view of the gardens & sculpture makes it worthwhile. I highly recommend this place for lovers & lovers @ heart","1834":"Read about The Parish in the AZ Leaf.  Fascinating selection of brews . Factor in a knowledgable bartender by the name of Nate ,&  a few samples of very nice brews.\nThe meal and the beer ... very good! We'll be back with our friends & visitors.","1835":"Overall: As much as I want to like it more, the Parish didn't offer the food experience I was looking for.\n\nThe good: When you first walk in you immediately get hit with the vibes and atmosphere, and it's interesting yet inviting and the decor is out there. Our waitress was friendly and helpful and the food came out quickly and hot, with healthy portion sizes.\n\nThe not-so-good: Unfortunately, the food was underwhelming. The burger, while tasty, was too undercooked and the buns were a too \"fluffy\" for my liking. It overwhelmed the burger. The crawfish hushpuppies, while good, had no resemblance of crawfish in them. \n\nFood: 5\/10\nService: 8\/10\nAtmosphere: 8\/10","1836":"Went out for an anniversary dinner and decided to go with Rats since it hosted part of our wedding festivities. \n\nWe started the meal with a relatively new item on the menu the lobster crepes. The crepes texture was very very smooth and delicate and the carrot ginger sauce was simply delicious. The only down side was that the lobster pieces were shredded removing both texture and lobster taste form the dish. \n\nHad the lamb duo (special for that night) for dinner and my wife had to the pork collard.  Both were virtually and maybe even surprisingly flawless given the number of components that they included. Both were well seasoned and well-prepared with the lamb being perfectly cooked to medium rare wild the pork was fork tender and the orzo bed provided a nice back drop. \n\nWe finished the evening with a glass if the Mucato dA'asti and their home made cinnamon doughnuts. - one word fantastic.","1837":"I absolutely love parish! It's one of my favorite places to go for a special occasion date night. The food is absolutely amazing, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is friendly and helpful.","1838":"Delicious! Shrimp n grits and ny strip wow... sauces are one of a kind. I drink sour beer and they had 4 kinds yay...greatest bartenders n intriguing alcohol brewing on the shelf","1839":"Great service, exceptionally crafted food, warm atmosphere. Recommend both types of oysters - worth every penny! Love the French fry dipping sauce. Cornbread is also an excellent choice. Great selection of infused liquors, beers, and specialty drinks. This restaurant is all about quality and service! No wonder the chef won Iron Chef Tucson!","1840":"We went as a group to this restaurant filled with excitement hoping that the restaurant will live up to its reputation- the salmon was dry and served lukewarm.  It was probably cooked earlier then reheated before serving.  The wine was crisp and went well with the chocolate desert. It would have been a perfect night had it not been for the main course-lito fune","1841":"Sorry the bulk of Tucson, I am going to have to disagree with you and state that the food here is not that good.  I have been here twice.  First time I ordered the gumbo -meh.  Second time I got all pumped up to try the burger that was voted the best in the city.  My fav burger I have had in Tucson was from Jax Kitchen.  I got the burger, took 3 bites, and was done.  Burger is overdesigned and you just taste salt and the jam.  Huge let down.","1842":"Don't be fooled by the name!  Rat's is a beautiful & charming restaurant with wonderfully delicious food!\n\nRat's is situated w\/in 'Grounds for Sculpture' and is as dreamy as the park.  I love the rich & playful decor - both inside and out - even the building itself.  \n\nWe started with the cheese board (see pix).  I can't recall all of the types of cheeses, but I really enjoyed all but one.\n\nI had the warm shrimp salad, which was just excellent.  It boasted three large shrimp in a really tasty sauce with a wonderful portion of sliced avocado as well :)  YUM!\n\nVince had a delcious 'wild boar ragu' dish.   I will absolutely order this if I come here again.  The polenta put this meal over the top in my opinion.  Sinful!\n\nMy children both had the chicken fingers platter.  Although visibly (and purposefully) salted, they were very good & nicely sized.  We were all disappointed by the side salad it came with though.  Much too funky for children --- or my children, anyway.  \n\nSumptous desserts were on the menu but we passed.  The kids both got a scoop of vanilla icecream to end their meals though.  I didn't try it as I'm not a 'vanilla person' but my son acted like it was the best vanilla he'd ever had?!","1843":"GORGEOUS venue!!!! Photographed a wedding here so didn't get to really taste the food, but the venue is sooooooo beautiful!!! The restaurant is made up of a bunch of different rooms...each with it's own vibe. On the grounds of a Sculpture Garden...super romantic...reminiscent of a French Chateau.  I see A LOT of venues as a wedding & event photographer,  but this one literally took my breath away. The food and service looked top-notch. I had a drink and appetizers. The venue was so pretty that decor was not even needed. Definitely heading back on my personal time with my family and friends!!! I only hear great reviews from anyone who has been there.","1844":"LOVE.\n\nAte here 3x within 10 days. I haven't been this excited about a restaurant in Tucson in a long time!  The menu is small but creative and done extremely well. I've loved everything I've had and can't wait to go through the menu (note to self, return a few more times before the post holiday diet starts).  Some of the standouts: \n\n 'bacon & egg' - I thought about this dish for days after I had it. It's crispy, creamy, spicy, sweet...just completely awesome. \nParish burger - definitely up there as one of the best burgers ever! Perfect amount of blue cheese, not overwhelming at all.\nSpicy pulled pork - it is spicy and so delicious!\nbacon popcorn - addictive\nfrog legs - crispy & tender\n\nAs far as ambiance, they worked with what they had and I don't mean that in a rude way. (I actually respect it). They obviously didn't have the big budgets of places like Union Public House but it's comfortable. It's not a place to see & be seen but if you're into that, I'd advise you to go here for dinner then move onto the pretty people places.","1845":"I was excited to go to The Parish for a lovely time and great meal on the patio.  We were greeted by a waiter who passed us off to the hostess, whom seemed a bit upset that we interrupted her phone call.  Then our waiter turned out to be the same person that passed us off.  The food came out quickly, but was pretty bland ( also noted by others) unfortunately.  Thennn, someone on the patio lit a cigar while we were eating.  It literally ruined the experience.  It stank SO badly.  Our waiter shrugged and said, \"it's out of my hands.\"  We had our food packaged and left.","1846":"We tried 4 different cocktails that the bartender recommend - all with their own infused liquor....every one of them was amazing!  Ordered the Parish Burger and it was cooked to perfection, tasted amazing and exceeded our expectations. The Drunken Angel pasta dish with shrimp and crawfish may have been one of one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  Flavor was out of this world and perfectly complemented with bread to sop up any goodness left behind in the bowl.  Next time we come to Tucson, this will definitely be our first stop. Well done and thank you to The Parish!","1847":"Horrible service. The manager, Cheryl, had to come out to our table 4 times to apologize for different things that had gone wrong with our meal (sat with no waiter for 20min, running out of food (TWICE), needing to move us to a different table b\/c our meal took so long (their fault) and another party was coming). She handled the situations poorly. Our waiter was incredibly nice and really tried to help. We will not be returning.","1848":"Most flavorful and pleasant dinner I've had on a Saturday evening in Tucson!! Love love loved everything and definitely enjoyed the array of choices in spirits and gluten free options! Will be returning hopefully soon!","1849":"We had the late night specials: fries, edamame, hush puppies and the the moon burger. Drinks : vodka splash of cranberry and a margarita made with cucumber infused tequila. Everything was delicious!  Live band was a bonus! Definitely would return. On first glance you may have doubts but this place was awesome!\n\nStormin the Sazerac!","1850":"Baybeeeee this spot is IT. Perfect portions, clean, good service. No complaints. I am leaving here all the way satisfied lol. And shout out to our waitress Chelsea!!","1851":"Love the Parish! The food and drinks are very good. We came at 3:00 on a Wednesday,  The bartender served us and she was very attentive \n\nWe ordered the Drunken Angel, Haitian Pork Sandwich, Gumbo, and my grandson had a hotdog. I would recommend ordering cocktails and beer here. The selection is unique and interesting and goes well with the food.\n\nIt isn't the kids' favorite place to go because they don't have very kid friendly options. They need better options besides grilled cheese and hotdogs. To be fair, this isn't really a kid place, but when the adults need their time at the Parish, we sometimes bring the grandkids.  Better kids options makes them more motivated.","1852":"Just had dinner here. Had the chops, salad and corn bread. Amazing. Jess was fantastic and a cutie pie! We are just driving thru town on our way to Florida from Ca., saw the great reviews on yelp, decided to try the local gastro-was impressed. If we ever are back in Tucson...we'll be back!","1853":"First time customer last night.  We had the crayfish hush puppies, shrimp and grits, drunken angel.  All very good although I prefer the creamy grits over a grits cake.  Being a bit far from the restaurant, we took the gumbo to go.  Definitely recommend The Parish for those who enjoy this type of cuisine!","1854":"2** for the Pre-fix brunch: Over priced & nothing special AT ALL! You'd be better off getting things a la carte. \n\n4**** for the ambiance: its lovely, magical, mystical, serene, exotic....just really really nice. Something very different. Worth the trip.\n\nService was very polite & good.\n\nDrinks here would be a much better option. But just to come here for the ambiance, I'd be willing to give the menu another try.","1855":"My husband I are becoming regulars. The best bartenders in Tucson. Fun creative drink menu. Food is always tasty and spicy.","1856":"Incredible and unique menu. Probably one of our very favorite restaurants in the Tucson area.","1857":"Went for late dinner during my AZ trip.  It was bit out of way from our lodging but was well worth it.  Great food.  And there was live music night we went, which we really enjoyed.  Plenty of interesting interior decor to look at.","1858":"This was my first experience and I must say we were beyond thrilled with our entrees. We were promptly seated and enjoyed mix I believe it was Caitlyn's, service as they were attentive and well mannered.\n\nBoth hubby and I chose the Drunken Angel, the broth was extremely robust and very cheesy (didn't realize they'd pile high the Parmesan or I would have nixed that), PLENTY of crawfish and shrimp offered, the pasta was the angel variety, but boy the portion! I took half home as it is a lot of food making the $20 definitely worth it. Plus the large baguette slice was perfectly crispy around the edges and soft on the middle whole also bring perfectly buttered... Nothing worse then there being too much or too little and there was a bit of garlic salt added. \n\nA friend had the burger and fries and he said it was good but nothing spectacular. I'm interested in going for the quail next","1859":"Booked to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday! Was impressed by our server, Jay, and the delicious food. Scallops, French onion soup, the homemade bread with butter, the 3 cheese Mac n cheese, the grapefruit tart and salted popcorn ice cream were phenomenal. We're already planning our next date out there this winter! Thanks for allowing us to create a great memory!! Service was great and the drinks were awesome too! Loved the sangria!","1860":"One of our favorite date night spots! The atmosphere is great. The food and drinks are amazing!!! Try the Dutch Well Water!","1861":"We wanted to treat our family to a special evening out. In the past we have only had happy hour drinks and appetizers. This was our first dinner there together. Our grown kids and their partners were impressed with the ambiance and character of the space. Our meals were served hot and were delicious. From the appetizers, main courses, to dessert it was all perfect. Our two servers were excellent and attentive to our needs. \nAfter we finished they opened one of the patio doors so we could stroll through the outside area a bit. It was a colder evening, but still so enjoyable. When we came back, they were waiting right there to allow us back in to exit through the restaurant. Overall, Rat's gave us the special evening we had hoped for.","1862":"Great place.  The food is incredible and the service was top notch!\nWill come back every time I come down from Phoenix.","1863":"I don't know where these great reviews come from.  The Gumbo was absolutely horrible.  It was super salty, had just threads of chicken in it and zero to one or two tiny pieces of sausage in it.  It was also really really smoky tasting.  Now I love smoky taste, but this was like licking the inside of a fireplace.  Three of us at the table had the gumbo and we all agreed it was really bad.  I couldn't even eat mine, but I was so hungry I did eat all the hush puppies. They were pretty good.  I used to live near NOLA and I know what good Cajun food is.  This is not it.  \nThe decor is nice, and the staff is friendly.","1864":"This counts as a \"Spa-cktail\" (I just made that up). It's their \"Dutch Well Water\"...house-infused cucumber gin, fresh lime juice, peach bitters and house-infused lavender water. Plus, look at this gorgeous glass I've been wanting to try this for MONTHS!! I'm not even a gin girl & it tastes amazing. Floral tartness with a crisp finish.  I highly recommend!","1865":"We just tried to come here for dinner and what a terrible terrible experience. They told us it would be a 5 to ten minute wait. There were open tables when we walked in. We waited almost thirty minutes with our baby and continually asked why we couldn't have an open table. They said they were for reservations and that the servers were too busy to get to some of the other open tables. After thirty minutes we left. They didn't try to speak to us before hand or explain the situation as we left. The hostess was extremely rude. What a huge disappointment.","1866":"We visit Grounds for Sculpture every April for my boyfriends birthday, and we always have lunch at Rats. Because it's not too hot in April, we love sitting outside next to the water. It's so beautiful. The service is always good, not extraordinary, but honestly it's better for the ambiance to not be bothered every 5 minutes by your waiter. The menu is limited, but very good, high class stuff. You are automatically given ice water and sliced sourdough bread with a delicious herb butter. My boyfriend got Rat's seafood salad, which has fresh seafood like calamari and shrimp. The lemon vinaigrette is an excellent addition. I got the chicken salad sandwich that came with a small side salad (on plate) and a pickle. My sandwich was wonderful (I'm a simple kinda girl) and I got the macaroni and cheese for an appetizer. Unfortunately the macaroni was a little over cooked, but the flavor was good. \n\nMy favorite part of this place is their watermelon cucumber refresher because it's so simple and SO refreshing. My boyfriend got the pineapple ginger refresher and he also said it was very good. \n\nFor dessert we got the Chocolate Coconut Semifreddo. It was immaculate. I'm a big fan of this place but it's definitely out of my price range to frequent. I'll see you again in a year, Rats.","1867":"I am a big fan of Cajun food and this place did not disappoint. Our waitress made some great recommendations and we had an excellent meal. We live an hour away but it is well worth the drive.","1868":"This is a beautiful restaurant in an extraordinary setting. You are literally in a Monet painting surrounded by his friends Renoir and Degas. Why three stars? Well it was a wedding and the food was so so. Music was great, booze fine, but the food other than a couple of hor douvers was average at best. Nevertheless, I would try Rats again to get a taste of their regular French menu. Have a feeling it would be quite an improvement. It is a very unique place. Also make sure to check out the Sculpture Garden, a real gem!!!!!","1869":"When am I paying $11 for a hotdog? When it comes wrapped in bacon and covered in ham, pulled pork and pork rinds. It's called the War Pig. Get it. Eat it. Thank me later.","1870":"Its is a good place for a drink. However,  the service is horrible.  We have been there a total of three times. Two of those times we were standing by the hostess stand we waited for over 16 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Employees kept on walking by and no one took the time to greet us. We ended up leaving both times. We finally gave it a last third opportunity,  this time it was mid day. We were seated. We tried the bacon popcorn, based on reviews.  Meh, it tasted like popcorn. Nothing out of this world.  We then proceeded to try the frog legs. Again, meh, they are wrapped in bacon I guess they do that to dress the taste of the frog. Which it does so if you are not looking to experience frog then yeah try them again not anything worth visiting this place for. Finally,  we try the adobo pork sandwich. To me it seem like it was pork prepared in a crockpot and liquid some was added. Final thoughts good bar, mediocre restaurant.","1871":"This place is definitely trendy, so be sure to make a reservation! We lucked out that there was a table outside, so we didn't have to wait. But make a reservation if you want some hip ambiance and a guaranteed spot. Food is tasty and creative, worth checking out while in Tucson!","1872":"This location does not carry beignets full time. The one star is only because this location is shown as being the top destination for beignets.","1873":"Fun, interesting atmosphere.  Great service.  We had the shrimp po' boy with hushpuppies, and the fish and chips.  Delicious.  We ordered two Black Session lagers.  The bottles were opened, but the caps were left on.  Under the caps are the \"rock, paper, scissors\" signs.  We used this game to figure out who paid for dinner.\nHad a nice time, will return.","1874":"I have enjoyed many delicious dinners, happy hours and events (best Halloween party I've ever been too - 3 years in a row!) at Rat's.  There is a small space to walk outside and enjoy the lake, some sculptures and just a lovely atmosphere.  Sunset is just gorgeous!!\n\nThe sculptures throughout the grounds are simply amazing.  The best thing is that you are not sure, until getting up close, that they are not a real person.  Living in Hamilton we drove past the ones on the streets many times and at least half the time I would wonder why some guy was teaching his child to ride a bike when it was raining (Kuser Road sculptures)!! \n\nThe only caution is that you should avoid attempting to host a special occasion (wedding, reception..) as the STARR Catering Group is not very organized.   See my review on FB - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/Events.STARR\/about\/?ref=page_internal","1875":"If the place didn't smell of grease, it would be an easy 5 star. The food, New Orleans influenced, goes beyond good because it is done with a creative flair. A casual ambiance and friendly service deserve mention .  Be sure to visit when you want a drink. The drink menu is extensive and terrific. Highly recommend.","1876":"I have been to Rat's many times, and I am a member of Grounds for Sculpture.  This past Saturday's visit was truly disappointing.  My husband made reservations two weeks prior to Saturday's date to celebrate my birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by three hostesses and promptly seated. To my surprise, we were taken thru the bar and seated at the last table closest to the door to the patio, rather than in the dining room. Shortly after being seated, guests for a wedding began streaming past us out the door to the patio; including photographers with camera equipment, and a quartet with large cases of musical instruments on wheels, one of them bumping into my husband's chair on the way out and startling him. The quartet right outside the door next to our table. When the door was left open we couldn't hear each other. Each group that exited past us would leave the door open, requiring my husband to get up and close it. At one point when one of the hostesses went thru the door and my husband asked her to close it. She told him that there was no point because it doesn't close completely.  Our waiter kept apologizing, tried to keep shutting the door when it caught his eye, and offered dessert on the house because of the poor seating and the constant disruption.  We appreciated his effort, but when another waitress brought the complimentary birthday dessert it was yet another disappointment.  Although the dessert was beautifully presented with Happy Birthday written in chocolate, the waitress could not light the candle because of the overhead ceiling fan, so she just said sorry and walked away. The experience was very disappointing.  A night to celebrate my birthday, that I had anticipated for two weeks, was totally ruined.","1877":"Whether you stop for just a drink or a full on meal, The Parish is one place you do not want to miss for southern dining. Not only was the Parish Burger excellent, but the Bloody Mary I got was the best I've ever had. \nOur server David was a delight! I will be sure to return to this fine establishment.","1878":"Consistent quality, great service, drinks to die for. I love this place late night for a burger and drinks. It's also a great place to grab lunch with the kids.","1879":"Came here for lunch while visiting Grounds for Sculpture one Sunday afternoon around 12pm. The restaurant atmosphere is beautiful, specifically the out door patio area. I was hoping to get a seat outside but the hostess said that none were available and there would be a long wait so we just sat indoors. \n\nThe restaurant is very upscale and the service was excellent. We started with the watermelon sangria and the blueberry lemonade (non-alcoholic). Both were very delicious and refreshing. \n\nNext my fianc\u00e9 and I split a French Onion soup which was very good and had a ton a flavor. We then got the Reuben and the Burger and split it half and half. The burger was delicious! Really tasty, juicy and there was a secret sauce on it that gave it an extra wow factor. It also came with shoestring fries.  I wasn't a big fan of the Reuben however - it came on a focaccia type bread that had an odd flavor and their was a mustard sauce on it that wasn't my favorite.\n\nOverall the meal was good, but I don't think the quality is worth the price. The above meal came to over $100 which is well over what I think is reasonable for lunch. It's worth trying for the \"experience\" if you're having a day at Grounds for Sculpture, but make a reservation to sit outside and be prepared to spend some $$!","1880":"Great food, great environment!  I've had the Quail the Gumbo, shrimp and grits. It's all amazing food.","1881":"I was traveling to Tucson on business and did a yelp search for best restaurants and I was not disappointed. I ordered the chicken which was so juicy and delicious and also amazing  Brussels sprouts. The live music was great, the service super friendly. I highly recommend The Parish to locals and visitors alike.","1882":"The food is fantastic! Nice ambiance and pleasant staff make for a great overall dining experience.","1883":"Wow!  What can I say about this place, other than it wasn't worth driving clear across Tucson for?!  Upon two different friends' recommendations, we took the drive of over sixteen miles one way.  For what?  Mediocre food and the poorest, inattentive service by our server and owner?  We started the culinary experience with BACON POPCORN (yes, bacon fat was used to pop the popcorn and bacon bits sprinkled on it.) and HOMEMADE PRETZEL BITES WITH SPICY CHEESE DIPPING SAUCE.  They were both good, but not out of this world.  We had placed our entree order before our appetizers arrived and waited for over an hour.  The items weren't tricky.  My partner ordered Gumbo, and I ordered a shrimp po boy.  When asked where our food was I told the server, if they hadn't started on the sandwich to cancel the entrees.  The cook hadn't even dropped the shrimp into the fryer and how long does it take to ladle some Gumbo out of a pot.  We then had to wait to get a check to pay for the appetizers.  The owner tried to save face by hurrying up the kitchen staff and gave us our entrees in to go boxes.  Of course we weren't charged for the entrees, but given the extraordinary amount of time we wasted waiting on food, he should have done what many other managers\/owners do----COMP THE ENTIRE BILL!  The entrees were average, but I would never return to a place that doesn't give good service.  There was no apology from the owner, just a statement that the kitchen is backed up.  A soup and sandwich wasn't rocket science, should have been on my table in less than ten minutes!  Please save yourself a headache and avoid this place---UGH!!!","1884":"This place is just mouth watering. There pasta marinated in wine is so savory sweet. The BBQ chicken is so juicy and smokey. The wine and beer selection is definitely the best. I love bringing my family here for special get togethers. The atmosphere is so subtle and calm with a wait staff that is polite, friendly and Make you feel like part of their family. Would absolutely recommend this place!!","1885":"A little bit of N'Orleans soul food in the foothills of Tucson. Not inexpensive but with a robust bar and interesting menu, such as bacon wrapped frog legs. The vibe is hip and the patrons hipper. Definitely make reservations first.","1886":"We have had lunch here several times in the past year.  And we will certainly go back again  The food is not french, however it is very good.","1887":"On a trip today from Phoenix and picked this restaurant out of the blue.  \n\nThe food was Great!!  I had the trout.  It was the best tasting fish I've ever had!  My husband had the fish'n chips and the fish was huge.  It also was the best tasting he ever had.  Glad we stopped to eat at the Parrish...","1888":"Great food!  Good service!  I found a piece of paper in my cornbread, but they gave me another one and bought dessert! Good atmosphere!  Make sure to make reservations because it was packed when we  walked in!","1889":"We love coming here! This place has great food with a southern influence. We love the shrimp and grits and the parish burger!","1890":"We were looking for a place to eat while on vacation we have seen the reviews on Yelp so went by to them. Great food different flavor profile but you won't be disappointed well worth the try. The Bread pudding is a must to have","1891":"Wow! What a great service and food. The bartenders were especially so kind and welcoming! They gave me sample of cocktail when I got curious watching her making it. Parishian was a great cocktail. The one with hot sauce was unique and my husband's favorite. Drunken angel made me feel like I was back in CA. The seafood flavor in pasta was very fresh and tasty, just as good as the one in Monterey Bay. I'm excited to try other dishes in the future. My friend's favorite was steak and frites.","1892":"Probably the worst \"cajun\" food that I've ever tasted. I'm from LA by the way and have eaten in places like New Orleans. I have tasted pretty decent to great cajun food outside of LA, in different states. Anyway, I have drunken pasta, which I thought was called that due to more so having a lot of sauce. No, no, no...it tasted like nastiest alcohol mixed with cheese. I mean I have heard of cooking with alcohol.","1893":"Seated outdoors overlooking the Grounds.  Service was semi-slow, but they made up for it by commenting on it and then comp'ing us the appetizer - the provencal mezze for the table, which is a mediterranean mix of hummus, quinoa, flatbread, olives and eggplant.  The eggplant caponata was outstanding.  \n\nSirloin was delicious, although overcooked at a medium when I asked for medium-rare.  The marchand de vin was amazing.  My wife's duck was very good.  Side mashed potatoes and kale also very good.  \n\nThe cocktails were good, not great.  \n\nAfter dinner we walked the lit Grounds with drinks.  \n\nThe food, service, and atmosphere are legit.","1894":"I think four stars is a bit reachy, but the cuisine was very good and the service was excellent.  I've been to the grounds for sculpture but never here for dinner. Nice little touches from the kitchen at the start and at the end. An amuse-bouche of asparagus and pea soup as the first culinary treat. I must say I haven't before thought of any thing pea soup related in this way, but it was tasty and set the right tone for what was to come. Generally speaking, whether intended or not, I found in my menu choices flavors that were appealing but not pushy or overbearing in any way. Nothing that was clumsily thrust at us whether to boast or to mask; just honest and accessible which is how I like my cuisine. \n\nTwo observations. I wished for slightly warmer temperatures for everything but the room which at 73 degrees was a few degrees too warm for me ( how's that for a detail? ). And I thought the stemware was a touch below grade so to speak. A superb wine in a finer glass without any marks would have been a nice touch in terms of execution. \n\nOur server was excellent. Pleasant.  Knowledgeable. Efficient. Well paced meal start to finish. Neither ahead of us nor trailing. \n\nAmbience was also good. We dined in one of the second floor rooms seated side by side facing out.  I liked the smaller individual rooms which reduce crowd noise and allow for pleasant conversation. \n\nNo hesitation returning, which will be the test of consistency.","1895":"This review is long overdue and I am not one to give a poor rating easily. Actually I am not an avid reviewer on yelp at all. But, I feel like I need to make an exception in this case since it was the worst meal of my life on a very special occasion.\n\nMy husband and I had reservations for Valentines Day dinner at 8:45 pm. We arrived at 8:30pm and were asked to wait and were seated at 9:30 pm. We didn't mind since the place is beautiful and we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne (nice touch). But, from here on its a downward spiral.\n\nAfter being seated, our waitress asked if we would go with the pre-fixed menu for the night or the a la carte menu. We decided to go with the latter for our shared love for short ribs. She took our order and returned a few minutes later to let us know that they were out of the short ribs. So, we still kept our hopes up and didn't want to make a big deal of it and switched to the pre-fixed menu with the wine pairings ($300 for two). Each of the five courses was worse than the previous one....in terms of flavor, cook of the proteins, authenticity and portion size. I can forgive the less than half a fist sized portions, but both the octopus and the quail were overcooked and rubbery. The dessert was a thick and dense slice of chocolate mousse that tasted bitter and was hard to swallow even for my husband who has a sweet-tooth and has never (literally never) left a bite of dessert behind.\n\nTo add to all of this, our waitress was either feeling the pressure of the kitchen or the multiple complaints from people seated all around us or was just not a skilled waitress - she missed a course while serving and had to be reminded that we hadn't had the previous course, she brought out a second helping of the dessert for us only to find half eaten desserts already on our table, she saw that we hadn't finished our wine from the previous course and yet poured the wine for the next course and left it sitting on our tiny table. To give her credit where its due, she seemed kind and was apologetic for each mistake.\n\nWe probably have had some pretty bad meals thus far, but, never one where we paid over $300. Needless to say, we will never return to this restaurant for the food. Their location is stunning so if you must, then head over while the sun is still out to enjoy the scenery......definitely not the food. What a shame!!!","1896":"Ive only been there once. It was the greatest single meal I've ever had in my life. It was 2012 and I got the braised pork shank over risotto. The food was incredible the atmosphere is wholesome and the grounds for sculptures near by is The most pleasant way digest the exquisite meal. It's not just a restaurant it's an experience","1897":"I don't know what to say.... I ordered a Po-boy and the bread was super hard and the gumbo tasted very different of what I had before in places like pappadeaux, I was a bit disappointed, but everything inside my Po-boy was really good.","1898":"The WORST late night menu ever. Not only was there nothing appetizing to nosh on, it was disgusting. Nothing on their menu pairs with late night drinks even. Who wants smoked trout (think chopped up lox) after 10pm? I ordered it because I was hungry- and it was dry. They served it on a small plate which made it too difficult to eat. My boyfriend said the gumbo was disgusting. \n\nStick to lunch or dinner- skip late night menu as of where it stands now. YUCK!","1899":"So Glad we tried this place, in Tucson for a couple days to get away. I wanted someplace new for us to try. Tired of the places near the UArizona campus. Off the beaten path a bit but was well worth it. My friend and I were meeting up with friends here, a party of 4. Made Saturday night 7:30 reservations through yelp, worked perfectly. When we arrived our table was waiting for us. Service from Alyssa was great, attentive and friendly, helped us out on craft cocktail selections.\n\nWe ordered a couple cocktails: Peach Brandy Shady (House-infused peach brandy, elder flower liqueur, fresh lemon, Four Peaks Peach Ale) and the Doctor (George Dickel Whiskey, Courvoisier, Peychaud's bitters, ginger ale) while perusing the menu. The menu had great choices. We ended up ordering the P.E.I. Mussels, Baked Oyster Blue, Bacon Popcorn, Johnny NY Strip Steak & Frites and the and the Carolina Pulled Pork Pibil. \n\nThe cocktails were great! All the food was great!, not knowing what to expect size wise from the oysters, BIG! and delish! Steaks were cooked to our request. Mussels were excellent along with the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Probably the weakest and least favorite was the Bacon Popcorn, not much bacon taste.\n\nAtmosphere: fun and they have their own parking lot. Service: excellent. Food: Excellent","1900":"This is my husband and I'd favorite restaurant in town. It is our go to for date night with out our son, and worth the drive from our house. The staff is amazing, the food is phenomenal, and the drinks are heavenly. You won't be disappointed.","1901":"Love this place\nWhen in town, I always make it a point to stop in\nSpectacular service\nDamn good Gumbo too\nLove it","1902":"Dropped by there today, great choice. Friendly service even though it was understaffed at the time, 3pm. Started with the Crawfish Hushpuppies and Bacon Popcorn, both were very good but the bacon popcorn is fantastic. The Haitian pulled pork and the Adobo pulled pork sandwiches are both equally good. The Haitian sandwich being spicy, having a Caribbean jerk flavor, not really for those not liking spice. Try the lemonade, some of the best I've ever had. If you're looking for something different try this place you won't be disappointed.","1903":"Exelent service by alexis \nWere coming back soon drinks and dessert, restaurant was busy and they just took like 10 minutes for getting us a table. Exelent","1904":"Go for the cornbread and stay for the Dutch wellwater. \n\nThere is a lot of seafood on the menu which I am not a huge fan of, unfortunately, but  revived rave reviews from my friends. The drinks though, the wonderful and well crafted drinks get me every time.","1905":"Wow!!! This place is amazing! A little piece of New Orleans in Tucson. Everything was fresh and tasty...drinks on point!!!!!!!!!! Will be back soon and often!","1906":"The late night music, bar munchies, & bar are spot on. Both bartenders are great, even if you're only having one drink & eating at the bar. Prompt, friendly. So why 4 stars? Our dinner experiences have been hit and miss. Service is sometimes prompt, sometimes not. The food generally is good, though one member of our party had a not-so-good experience last time we were there. If you do plan to go for dinner, make a reservation as it's usually crowded.","1907":"Travis Peters brings his mom's recipes and the flavor of Nawlins to Tucson!   The traditional cajun cuisine lives on here!  Bravo Travis bravo!!","1908":"Came here at 4:30 to find it closed early, been wanting to check this place out so very disappointed","1909":"Simply the best. All atmosphere, food, drinks, service, etc.. were top notch. If you are considering this place for a special night, I urge you to stop searching and make the reservation, you won't regret it. For me, dinner was part of the moonlight tour, which was cancelled because of weather. They were willing to reschedule us, but we couldn't find a date that worked, so they still accommodated us for dinner and comped our drinks. We were still allowed entry into the park for our own self guided tour, which was probably even better because we weren't rushed through dinner to make the tour. It was lovely.","1910":"I love this place. It's pricey. But you can find some unique, beautiful, and meaningful gifts here. \n\nI don't think I've ever walked out empty handed. Staff is very helpful but not pushy. It's a Reno-Tahoe store.","1911":"Have now been here 3 times over the past few years, when in town, and my experience has been consistently positive. I've enjoyed my food, drinks and the waitstaff. I wish the menu was a bit more extensive but I left full and satisfied.","1912":"This is one of our favorite if not favorite restaurant in Tucson! The owner is the best and the food is amazing! We've gone dozens of times and never have had a bad experience! The food is interesting and at first took me out of my comfort zone - but I'm so happy because my taste buds exploded lol! Seriously tho, super good food, very fun atmosphere! Creative dishes and I love to support local GOOD people!! Please go NOW!","1913":"Just not one of my favorite places. I had the shrimp and grits and I thought it was very rich. The grits were coated and fried so I did not like this. The cornbread was just okay. I won't be returning to this restaurant.","1914":"I was disappointed in Thanksgiving at Rat's.  First, let me say that I was a food server for 16 yrs, and bartender for 2 yrs, in Country Clubs. \nWhen making my resv. here, I asked if the adjoining Grounds for Sculpture would be open Thxgvg, and I was told Yes it would be. (it was not). \nI checked my resv status thrice before.  Upon arrival Thxgvg, I was met by the most unprofessional hostess I've ever encountered, a bad attitude is putting it nicely. She was downright condescending.  When I was finally seated, after a fiasco of choices given me, I tried to discreetly tip the hostess anyway, but she abruptly dropped it onto the table and flicked it away with her fingers, with a, \"No. No.\"   Unbelievable.  She couldn't even refuse a tip politely. \nNow seated, the appetizers were set out buffet-style on the patio which was partly enclosed by plastic drapings, heated but still drafty and cold. The Apps were interesting, the shrimp large.  I enjoyed the Apps.  The Entr\u00e9e however was a big disappointment.  I had the Turkey, which arrived warm, not hot, and undercooked, still pink and chewy.  Now haute cuisine usually undercooks but this was too undercooked, too chewy, and bland to taste, as was the gravy, and the smear of tasteless mashed white potato on the plate on top of which the turkey slices were placed, which I thought a poor presentation.  Bread was 2 small pieces of peasant bread and a Pop-Over, which were tough, with herb butter.\nThe sweet potato was a small square, 'flaked' with swiss cheese between; the brussel sprouts were good, cooked with rosemary, but slightly burned and the stuffing was tasteless and too crusty.   \nAll in all, a disappointment for holiday fare.    \nThe hostess came by and asked how was my meal.  I said it was okay, but I disliked the turkey being placed in the mashed potatoes.  Her reply was, \"Well, I guess we'll have to get you separate plates for everything, won't we.\"  and she walked away.   (see me, shaking my head)\n((BTW, the other entr\u00e9e choices were uninspired, Roast Beef or Cod.))\nDessert was also buffet-style on the cold patio, consisting of tiny sections of what appeared to be small supermarket-bought pumpkin and pecan pies and sugar cookies dipped partly in chocolate.  Though to my table was brought a plate of tasty assorted mini-selections, which were good.  \nI thought the menu said a drink was included, but my hot apple cider (unspiked) was added to my bill.  \nFYI, I'd paid for coffee at the bar earlier, while waiting to be seated.  It cost $4. and tip.  Coffee was to come with meal, but no one thought about that.  oh well. \nNo one on staff ever ventured a smile, not the hostess, not the bartenders, nor any other staff I could see, except my waiter CHRIS.  Chris was professional, congenial and wore a smile the whole time. I gave him a generous tip.  \nInterestingly, I don't recall hearing any atmosphere music.   I wonder.\nThe prix-fixe price of $59. was not worth it here.  I'd chosen Rat's for atmosphere and grounds as well as the meal, but I found myself wishing I'd just gone to my local diner where the food is very tasty at 1\/3 the price.\n\n((Note:  I attended their Halloween Bash, and the '1' bartender in the rotunda was as slow as slow gets, and there were no refreshments to be had anywhere.  So perhaps some of the zombies roaming around that night really were.))   \n\nCONCLUSION:  I would Not do Rat's again, nor recommend it.  \nOver-rated.","1915":"The Parish is a really fun restaurant. They had live music on Monday night. The service was fantastic. My husband had the gumbo with shrimp and loved it. He also had the hush puppies and thought they were good too. I had their award-winning burger and it was great. The french fries were a little limp and I prefer crunchy. The drinks were good.","1916":"Haven't been able to find the new location. Have tried to find it about 4x and no luck. GPS says I'm in the right spot, just no store there and for the record I'm pretty good with directions.","1917":"I have been following this store on Instagram and I just love all of their posts. I finally got the time to go to the store to look around. I was looking for a beer coozie I saw on their latest post. I was greeted immediately by staff and checked on multiple times. \nI love their selection of local themed gifts I really like the layout of the store and the location is easy to find.\nThey have everything from cool kitchen towels to mens beard care items. I was shopping for a hard to buy for friends birthday and I found exactly the right gift. \nI will be back as I saw a couple things I want for myself. I definitely recommend shopping local and giving larkellen a visit you will not be disappointed.","1918":"We have lived in Tucson for 4 1\/2 months now and have eaten at The Parish on 4 occasions. Hands down our favorite Tucson restaurant. We've eaten at other excellent restaurants in Tucson, as a matter of fact, we are thrilled with the Tucson food culture. But, when it comes down to calling a favorite, it's The Parish. Their service, their cleanliness, their presentation, their food taste, and quality all 5 stars on every visit. We've never been disappointed. Can't say much more than that about a restaurant. I lean towards the \"Drunken Angel,\" my wife leans towards everything and anything on the menu. This brief review was prompted by another fantastic visit yesterday late afternoon. Thank you Parish Staff, Management and Owners.","1919":"Looked at this place a few times and finally made it here. A really nice surprise for those of us who love Southern style food. My husband had the Quail dinner - fried cheesy grits and meal very flavorful. I ate the Gumbo sans additions (ie crawfish or shrimp) - flavorful and just the right amount of spice. The hush puppies taste like my MIL used to make. Will be sure to make it back next time we are in town. Thanx for the great food","1920":"We have come back again! \nGreat food and Ambience. We liked it the first time, came back a second time. Now a must do!!","1921":"A great place to get legit southern-creole style food in AZ. We had the Drunken Angel and fish and chips. Did not disappoint! They even have sweet tea!","1922":"This has been on my To Try list for some time now.  Finally had a chance to eat out without the kids.  I knew they would not be able to find something to eat here after viewing their online menu. And I think children are just too picky of eaters to really enjoy restaurant food.\n\nI had looked at the online menu several times and knew they had a shrimp po-boy for lunch.  I specifically came here just for that.  I was not disappointed.  It did remind me of when I lived in New Orleans for over two decades.  The French bread was very fresh.  I prefer the tails of the shrimp pinched off but the cornmeal breading was light and tasty. \n\nHowever, I also ordered a side of gumbo ($2 extra ) and the horseradish overwhelmed it so much I could not eat it.  If you are reading this managers, authentic creole cooking has no hot spices. Bottles of hot sauce are placed on the table (there were none at this establishment) so the customers can spice up a dish to their liking.  Making something automatically spicy excludes a portion of your customers so that they cannot enjoy these menu selections. \n\nMy wife ordered the World's Crispiest Fish n Chips.  Her plate came full of seasoned fries with a crispy fish filet placed nicely on top.  Since they advertise that the fish is the crispiest in the world, she was anxious to put it to the test.  Her fish was light, crispy and she could tell it was freshly out of the fryer.  The tarter sauce served with it appeared to be homemade and matched up to the fish perfectly.  The fries were the standard fare but she is not really a fan of seasoned fries so you may enjoy them more than she did.  She thought the price was a little steep for lunch ($11.00) but she would order again.  She wishs it would have come with coleslaw or a small side salad.","1923":"Some friends and I had dinner here before going to a high school football game.  We had a few appetizers including the bacon flavored popcorn, hush puppies and edamame.  All were very good. We were there at happy hour and they have $3 drafts of excellent beers.  For dinner, I had the shrimp and grits with a creole flavor to it.  Very good along with collared greens that has bacon in it.\n\n\nThe service was excellent. We let them know we were in a bit of a rush and they accommodated and were super efficient.   \n\nIf you are looking for a meal with a Cajun and creole flavor at a reasonable price along with excellent beer choices, the Parish is the place to go.","1924":"What a delightful experience.  One of the best overall restaurants I've visited in Tucson.  The inside is humble, trendy, and somewhat rustic.  All of the above was complimented by upbeat friendly personalities and great hospitality.  \n\nI had a few of their specialty cocktails, both were fantastic.  The mixology and infusions used were creative and precise.  The flavor profile was exuberant.\n\nI feasted upon the Parish Burger, ravenously.  The fries were hot and crispy...  the blue cheese was dripping with every bite.  The butter infused bourbon Manhattan I was sipping on added a sweet and savory touch.\n\nWe realized it was happy hour, $6 specialty cocktails kept our pockets full...\n\nMy senses were enlightened and my mind at ease in this cool and collected Tucson gem. I most definitely will be back.  \n\nYou stay classy Parish, love you.","1925":"The fancy restaurant at the grounds for sculpture is pretty upscale offering excellent service and food by the lake with fantastic view. The place looks like an aged french house with cute paintings and decor inside that make you feel like you are back in time. The wait staff and service here is fantastic. They explain everything and very professional. Also, the food is really top notch. A bit pricey but we went for lunch, so it wasn't so bad. But they have beautiful monet-like view with sculptures and fresh air, I think it's a must visit place in Hamilton. \n\nOmelette was very well-made and served well. French onion soup is a must try menu item there. It tastes like it was boiled for awhile so the onion flavors are well mixed in the soup and the bread. It didn't smell too strong either. It was very hearty and reminded me of those good old french onion soup from childhood. My favorite was the potato leek ravioli. It was very expensive for the portion but I'd definitely get it again. I could tell it was homemade with real potato leeks and the sauce was one of the best I've ever tried. One star is off for the expensive price though. This place doesn't disappoint.","1926":"Absolutely delicious. I had never been there and went with friends for lunch. The Bacon Popcorn was out of this world. My salad was one of the best I had ever had. Smoke glass of wine. Cannot wait to go back!!!","1927":"Rats is should be a part of any visit to the grounds of sculpture. The warm atmosphere  and friendly service is noticeable before the meal even starts. Lunch started with a bread service in which I had a choice of 3 different presumably French breads. I had a raisin bread and some kind of white bread. Both were good. Rats is known for their French onion soup, so I had that next. It seems everyone was ordering it. It was really cheesy and delicious, but I did have one large piece of bread in the soup that was too large to fit in my mouth without difficulty. I had to leave that in the bowl. My entree was the bacon cheeseburger. As soon as I cut it juices started flowing out.  That's what I like to see! The burger was so juicy and messy with perfectly cooked bacon that I was in burger heaven. But... the roll was not toasted and was a bit too thick. I suspect they got cheap rolls to cut costs, but a better toasted roll would have been perfect. The fries that came with the meal were tasty thin cut fries that served as the ideal accompaniment to the burger.\n\nDon't let the awful name scare you off from having a meal at Rats.","1928":"This is not exactly the type of restaurant I'd normally find myself going to but the people I were meeting really wanted to try it out.  When I first walked in, I noticed how loud it was.  Being that I was there for a dinner meeting I was a little irritated that I felt like I was yelling for the others at the table to hear me.  This was the only negative for the whole night.  Service was great, food was awesome and other than the noise, the ambience was great.  \n\nI had the shrimp and grits which was amazing.  The mussels app was equally as good.  I could have drank the broth from the mussels without feeling bad about it at all.  Our service was attentive without being annoying about it which was really nice.  \n\nI'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Tucson.","1929":"The food was excellent, but we were so rushed out that the waitress took my dinner before I was finished and before I could even stop her. She was clearly more concerned with getting the next table seated. Poor form Parish.","1930":"Came here again after a couple years since last try. Nothing has changed. Had the fish and chips wife had the burger. My fish was like it was cooked in colder grease it was soggy and my wife's burger was ordered med well came out very well. The only saving grace was the frys. Very over rated for what they have to offer. The waitress could care less when presented with the issues. Sat with a empty beer and ice tea glass for almost entire meal before being asked if we needed anything. Addios never going back","1931":"My wife and I are brand new to Tucson this week.  We've been out a few times visiting and ran in to The Parish our first trip.  The atmosphere is awesome, fantastic drinks, and delicious food.  So far it's the only restaurant we've been to multiple times.  Highly recommend!!","1932":"I've been in here twice now and I've had a great experience both times. The first time I came in for dinner and had shrimp and grits (a personal fav of mine from when I lived in South Carolina!). The dish was delicious and unique! We also had some delicious popcorn as an appetizer and the cocktails were yummy. The second time I came in was for brunch on a Sunday. It was pretty slow in the restaurant, but the service was still great. My only critique would be that the brunch menu was really limited. There were only 4 or 5 dishes to pick from, and a lot of the options they normally have for lunch, were unavailable. If you're looking to visit, I'd recommend going for dinner! The portions are filling, but a little more on the pricey side.","1933":"This is out favorite place to rat in Tucson.  Amazing food, atmosphere and service (Stephanie).  You will not be disappointed","1934":"Delish food and cold beer! There's always something fun going on whether it's a band or paint night.","1935":"Stopped here for lunch in the middle of our day at the sculpture park, as it gets busy a local friend was smart and made a reservation.  French menu is a little pricey but the food ranged from good to great and service was very professional.  What really sets this place apart is the atmosphere.  The building is beautiful and unique.  Instagram foodies would be in heaven!","1936":"We have gone to The Parish a couple times and always enjoyed ourselves. Good food, great drinks. The last time we went, about two months ago, it was not so enjoyable. We were there around 7:00 with another couple who we had not seen in a while and were so excited to eat and visit. Well we ate but the visiting was hard to do. They had live music and it was so loud you could hardly hear each other across the table. No, I am not \"old\" and do go out a lot...I like music but not so loud, right in the middle of dinner, when I really want to enjoy my friends. Even the people next to us said they would not come back for dinner if they continued having music that loud. I get it on a Saturday night or maybe after 9:00 pm but not at 7:00 on a Sunday or Monday, can't remember which day it was. Please consider turning the volume way down or maybe starting live music later in the evening. I will really have to consider going back if I want a dinner where I can visit with friends","1937":"So refreshing! Trying new food and new flavors! Not your cookie cutter fox concept fake crap.\nSo fresh\nSo good\nSo flavorful :)","1938":"I was disappointed in Thanksgiving at Rat's.

We finished the drunken angel today for lunch and it may have been even better! You will not regret eating here!","1941":"I went there for dinner with my girlfriend few weeks ago. It was on a beautiful summer evening with outdoor seating. Great atmosphere to catch up with someone over dinner. \n\nI had the salmon special and my girlfriend had the sea bass special. Very neat place that is bit different with view of a creek running through and gorgeous sculptures.","1942":"I had the smoked pulled pork sandwich on their lunch menu with the slaw as a side! It was delicious!!! The slaw looks basic but oh the flavors, probably the best vinegar slaw I've had, it was spicy but it was a slow heat!  The pork was tender and the bbq sauce was very flavorful. Presentation a 10 and fun!  Server was very attentive and pleasant. If you are in this area give \"The Parish\" a try!","1943":"The Parish has a very timeless delicate New Orleans feel as you enter the establishment. The transition to a table was seamless and practical. The bathrooms have to be commended for the simple design yet very hygienic and hands free experience. Now onto the food, I had ordered 2 dishes The Johnny stake and frites which was very pleasant to look at but quite bland and overexposed. The option to add crawfish was chose to sample the full experience of the dish. The sauce they soak the steak and fries in leaves it with a time clock ticking. The fries became inedible before being consumed and the steak was cold and flavor washed because of the sauce. The sauce itself was decent but not enough to hold up the lack of flavor to taste. This dish was more of a statement then a dish and to lighten the sauce would greatly improve the meals quality. I then had this same problem with the Drunken Angel, the Lobster Sauce accompaniment  was fantastic with the bread choice for the dish, but yet again was left with the dulled flavor of the Burgundy Angel hair pasta. Adding another piece of bread to the dish managed to make it more edible but left the pasta overwhelmed and soggy. The overlying theme I had received from these two dishes is that they are in fact statements to what the restaurant is supposed to be and not in fact dishes. My general experience was pleasant but the food was very underwhelming and dependent heavily on theme.","1944":"Oh Rats! What happened to you? You used to be so wonderful. I even had my graduation from Culinary school dinner here years ago. We took the kids for Easter Brunch today and I'm so disappointed that I'm writing this in the car on the way home. It was sub-par, a few good dishes like the eggplant caponata, the salmon and decent croissants gave me something to fill my belly. But I was so excited to have some wine and eat the advertised Oysters. They looked terrible, not fresh, broken shells, could have been shucked the day before as they were bone dry, no liquor at all. Against my better judgement I took two, the first one had a worm in it, a small live, slimy squirming centipede. I gave it to the waitress who advised the Chef would \"handle it\". The kitchen replenished the Oysters from a fish bin, so yes, they were shucked a while ago. Not the way to store them. Please don't offer them if you can't do it properly, you're going to make someone sick. I would have at least expected a comped drink or something after literally being grossed out, but no. Unfortunately, after dining at Rats a dozen or so times in the last few years, this will be our last visit as it has been getting progressively worse. It makes me sad.","1945":"Owners have southern roots in Baton Rouge and it shows. Not a phony knock off of creole food and bev. Clever menu, very nice and extensive cocktail list (with an authentic and tasty Sazerac too!), tons of house infused liquors and a stellar value on the happy hour drink menu. \n\nConsidering its location in Tucson, these guys got as close to NOLA as possible.  Give them a look.","1946":"Came in for a Sunday brunch awhile ago and forgot to write a review. The food was well prepared and the service was good. The whiskey selection was excellent and it's nice to see a Cajun\/Creole place in Tucson. Great place and I'll need to return to try more of the menu.","1947":"Brunch menu was meh. Only 4 entrees to chose and only was true breakfast. Food was good expensive compared with the portion given . I'd advice going for drinks and apps.","1948":"Special of the day Sea bass was delicious. As my cocktail (The Doctor) and the street corn were.","1949":"The food was outstanding very different but great combination. The drink selection was outstanding. Everything is homemade","1950":"We decided to check out the happy hour and I have to say I was pretty pleased. I don't know that I can afford to eat an entire dinner there however, it is a very nice treat to sit on the deck with a nice glass of wine and some very flavorful food.\n\nGlass of wine or five dollars. They have small plates specials and when they say small they really mean small. Half of them were definitely not worth 3 to 5 dollars. Two stars were the brussels sprouts and cheese curds.\n\nAlthough I didn't see it mentioned anywhere in the grounds for sculpture membership or the rats website we were informed that the discount is not available during happy hour.","1951":"I'm so glad we found this gem before heading home to Phoenix. Food was great - try the Bacon Popcorn!- and staff were all very friendly.","1952":"So cool.  Very romantic with many different rooms.  Even a cool lounge in the bar area by the fireplace where you can lay down.  Great service and attention to detail.","1953":"It's an overall wonderful experience.  We've been here twice - once for dinner and once for lunch.  Both times we spent about an hour or so checking out the sculptures and the beautiful grounds before eating.  And both meals were excellent.  The menu is creative, the baguettes and butter are delicious and the bar area is very appealing.  I don't remember what we had for dinner (but do recall that we loved it) when we were here a couple of years ago, but for lunch recently we had the salmon tartine appetizer and the cheese burgers.  Delicious.","1954":"We are here for a nice vacation seeing some local sites and searching for great eats! This place serves some fantastic food very southern Louisiana. Their gumbo was scrumptious! Their red beans and rice were awesome! Their drunken pasta was delectable! We had an order of bacon popcorn that was to die for. Their service was great, friendly, and was timely. The only drawback were their classic cocktails. Yes, they were tasty as many were handcrafted, however, the large price definitely did not match the small drink size.\n\nWould we return? Yes, definitely for the food, but not the drinks.","1955":"Tried The Parish for the first time recently and couldn't be happier with our experience! Yummy cocktails, and the Brussels are to die for!","1956":"We recently stopped in to check out the remodel and have some drinks and snacks.  They did a fantastic job and the place looks amazing!  Expanded with some vintage and fun touches it looks really good.  We enjoyed some old favorites of hushpuppies and the stuffed relleno along with some tasty cocktails.  We left very happy, great job guys!","1957":"Took a ride from Monmouth county to give rats a try on a Thursday evening with a 5:30 reservation.  As we neared the area, it was clear that  sculptures were a big deal there.  They were everywhere! The restaurant itself was on a large piece of property that i would call a sculpture park.  Parking was limited and we had to park on the access road.  As soon as you walk up to the restaurant you feel like you're walking into another world.  The structure is unique as is the interior. Lots of wood and kind of dark inside.  They had very strange tableware.  When we sat down, I looked out the window and saw that there was outside seating.  If I knew about it, I would have reserved.  If you go and the weather is nice, I would recommend it.  What a cool view! Since it was a thursday night, there was a prix fixe menu priced at $39 pp.  the price actually included admission into the sculpture park, so let's call dinner $33 pp.  you had a choice of soup or salad for starters. You had a choice of short ribs, chicken, trout and mussels for an entree and your choice of three deserts.  I found the food to be fair. I had the short ribs, which although cooked correctly, lacked flavor. the portion was not very big either.  I thought it was strange that the ribs were served with French fries and ketchup.  I would have preferred rice, potatoes or pasta.  The service was truly outstanding.  The waitstaff was proficient and professional.  After dinner they gave us wristbands for the sculpture park.  Although it had gotten kind of dark, the walk around the grounds was great.  If you are a photographer, def bring your camera.  Lots of photo ops.  We stopped at a gazebo where they gave out free gelato.  Although I didn't find the food to be up to par, I have to say the overall experience made our visit worth it.","1958":"Impressed that southern food spot would have gluten free options. Very accommodating with lots of choices. Delicious, filling food. Enjoyed the spice mixes and sauces on my dishes. Friendly, attentive service.\n\nWe were there on a Monday night and enjoyed live music too!","1959":"Gumbo is delicious- Chicken and Beef.  Slow Smoked BBQ Adobo Pork with Fries is to die for.  Service is fast and seat urselfz","1960":"Perfect first date, second date, 6 month anniversary date. You take your pick. Never disappointed!","1961":"The bacon popcorn is addicting. The portions are large and the specialty drinks are amazing. I wish there was one on the eastside.","1962":"Service was awesome. Food was straight amazing. Very popular place so be prepared for a wait. Worth it.","1963":"The Parish is a must if you're in Tucson. I loved the eclectic style and the modernized down South dishes they served up. I absolutely will be heading to The Parish any time I'm in the area. And with their warm and inviting staff, I felt like a long-time regular.\n\nWe started with the Crawfish Hushpuppies which comes with a sauce on the side. Their slightly spicy, but with the sauce it towns it down and they are the best hushpuppies I've ever had. My hubby ordered the gumbo after sampling it which also came with hushpuppies... I would totally recommend tearing those babies up, throwing 'em in the gumbo, and going to town. I ordered the Po' Boy with oysters. So good and perfectly breaded! I would have a hard time not ordering this every time I'm here.\n\nWe're not out this way a whole lot, but I really can't wait until the next time we're in the area or passing through. Top notch eats, a great environment, perfect for lunch, dinner, or drinks, and a happy staff to complete it all.","1964":"Excellent..waitress was very sweet and attentive.  The food was spot ON cajun... real and simply wonderful","1965":"Great food and atmosphere.  The gumbo was incredibly good.  Saw the positive reviews and tried it.  Its a really good restaurant.","1966":"The extent of my review is based on their drinks alone. My boyfriend and I have made this our weekend spot for drinks and appetizers. We've never actually eaten there but I can't imagine it'd be bad at all! All I know is, the drinks are to die for.","1967":"It would be 5 stars but the prices are too high and service can be a very slow, otherwise awesome place, best in the area. Great ambiance, set up like the restaurant is in Claudet Monet's garden at Giverny.  Try to get a seat outside so that you can enjoy the view and visit to the Sculpture Garden - it is a must!","1968":"I absolutely love this place. I have ordered many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favorite item has to be the drunken angel. To top it off, they have awesome drinks too.","1969":"I was in NOLA last month. I came to Tucson to see a friend. We came here. Our server was a total sweetheart. Service was superb. Our drinks were made perfectly. I had the drunken angels dish with crawfish and my date had the prawns. The grits isn't like a bowl of grits. It's a square. Almost like a patty. Get the grits!!!  If ever in Tucson again. I would love to come back here. What a charming little place with flavors that would make NOLA jealous!","1970":"I love the parish. Always had a great experience there.  Today I decided to try one of their specials for St Patrick's day.  I am so glad I did.  I got the corned beef and cabbage. WOW!  Cooked to perfection.  Perfect portion.  The horseradish sauce was a perfect combination.  The potatoes were tasty and perfectly cooked. So glad I got it when I did.  Will definitely sell out.  \nThe salmon salad was light and the flavor combinations worked.  The stout chocolate cake was a perfect finish.  This place is everyday awesome but they really know how to celebrate special days.","1971":"Great experience and can't wait to return! The whole vibe is French village and really captured well. They have their own sculptures around the grounds so you don't have to necessarily go to the grounds for sculpture. amazing colors. From where I was seated their was a bridge and water Lilly's that were a replica of the monet painting. Our waitress was very friendly. Loved the drinks and in house dessert chef with homemade icecream doesn't disappoint. Went for brunch and loved the light fare. Will return for dinner","1972":"This place is amazing! When I first came here, I was a bit wary because of the old-fashioned look of the restaurant, but this place sure didn't disappoint.\n\nOur waitress was very sweet and attentive. Our drinks were never empty, and everything was brought out hot. Their Fish & Chips dish is definitely the best I've ever had. The fish was extremely crispy, and the fries were deliciously seasoned. We also had the bacon popcorn, which was really interesting. Their prices were also very fair compared to the huge amount of food you get. \n\nOverall, this place is an awesome gem that I'm glad we found. Would highly recommend.","1973":"This is my favorite restaurant in Tucson. When I come to visit my relatives this is the place we must go to. The food and the service are beyond excellent.\n\nGreat place!","1974":"We had lunch reservations for Friday 9.6.19 for a birthday celebration. Hostess greeted us in a friendly fashion and acknowledged the special occasion. I was happy they acknowledged it. We had a great table overlooking the koi in the pond. The weather was overcast with spitting rain. However, the outdoor eating area is covered and it was warm enough to still sit outside. The birthday girl loved her scallop entree. My cauliflower steak could have been caramelized more for better flavor. Half of it had no color at all. Overall, the vegetable could have been more tender. The flavor of the dish was ok. It didn't blow my socks off hence the 4 stars not 5. Service was exemplary. I meant to recall his name but my memory is just not what it used to be. We ordered creme brulee to share and they decorated the plate with chocolate and a candle without being requested to do so. Great atmosphere to celebrate in and very pleased they remembered it was a special occasion lunch.","1975":"We had a great experience at Rat's! We dined on the patio on a gorgeous day after visiting the Grounds for Sculpture. The restaurant and the staff are taking all possible COVID precautions while still being friendly and attentive. We enjoyed everything we ate. I highly recommend the branzino (such a crispy skin), the crab cakes, and the chocolate cremaux dessert. The bread ans popover were also delicious. We were particularly touched by the anniversary message on our dessert and numerous staff members wished us a happy anniversary. We will definitely come back again. Thanks for a great experience!","1976":"Great Cajun, creole food, but the prices are a little high. The restaurant sitting space is tight and the waiting area for waiting patrons is very small. Good food, good drinks though. Probably won't go back for a while as the food prices are a little too high for me.","1977":"Service...great\nAtmosphere...cool\nFood...awesome \nSteak and frites rocked, compressed watermelon salad even better","1978":"We did not find the signature pasta dish edible. It was more soup than pasta. Basically all sauce with little substance even though it was the spicy.  Not as expected. First time we left our leftovers on purpose.","1979":"We came by with another couple on a Saturday and had a reservation for 6pm to stroll around the sculpture garden and 7pm for dinner. \n\nArrival is down a winding driveway turning past the front door then around a circular drive into the parking area. Not too many spots but we got one. Interesting sculptures all around.\n\nWe were greeted by the hostess and sat by a farm table awaiting our friends. The place is evocative of a French inspired, rambling farmhouse, rooms and nooks everywhere. Eclectic. Couples, families and children running about. Noisy, but in an oddly comforting way. Most of the tables looked out on the lake and grounds. There is a bar nestled in the center of the building, it was crowded. \n\nOur friends arrived and we ordered some drinks to have while we took our sculpture garden tour. It was a gorgeous spring day. The pieces of sculpture are all over and many look like facsimiles of familiar French impressionist paintings. Too many to describe all of them. I have included a picture of a piece I liked that seemed to move as we walked past.\n\nAfter a 45 minute stroll we returned to the main house and our table was ready as ordered. We were seated at what seemed to us to be one of the best tables on the edge of the dining room looking out over the pond with a bridge that recalled Monet's waterlilies. Very nice.\n\nServer arrived promptly. We ordered our cocktails then perused the menu. Selections are varied but not overwhelming. Mains we selected included short ribs, scallops, bouillabaisse and trout. Bread was brought out with a tasty flavored butter. Our starters were a spring salad, soup and escargot. My escargot were delicious. They were not served in the standard escargot serving plate but were presented in a cast iron skillet with a tasty butter sauce along with three pieces of baguette. I thought they were fabulous. My main was trout which was great. I order trout when I can it is not typically on the menu in most places these days and is a bony fish so you have to be careful. This filet was excellent. There was not a bone in it and the almandine sauce with a side of green beans was fabulous.  Everyone else enjoyed their dishes.\n \nService was good but not great. She was pleasant and informative but disappeared twice during the meal. She spilled one of our friends drinks into her hand bag and was somewhat brusque when cleaning it up. She was not anywhere on the radar as the meal wound down we had to call on another server to have our bill settled. \n\nAll in all a very pleasant experience. We say ambiance \"a\", service \"b-\", food \"a\", value \"b\".  We will return.\n\nMark & Nancy.","1980":"Dined at Rat's Restaurant today with 2 friends before heading over to the Grounds for Sculpture. From the moment I made the brunch reservation with Amanda, I knew we were in good hands - very nice, very professional. We were a little late for our reservation and were still greeted very warmly by the staff. Amanda reserved a perfect table for us - upstairs, near the windows - the room was airy, the breeze was flowing through the room, the ceiling was high - need I say more? My friends and I had the $44 per person buffet which basically included amazing appetizers (too many to list here), an entree, complimentary glass of champagne or mimosa and dessert buffet with coffee\/tea. The service was great - Abby our waitress was attentive, knowledgeable and knew when to pop over to the table and when to hang in the background. The Grounds for Sculpture were fabulous - we already said we wanted to revisit again. I highly recommend both Rat's Restaurant and the Grounds for Sculpture!","1981":"I'm a southern boy at heart, so I'm a sucker for places with a soul and some kick, and man-oh-man does the Parish have both in spades. \n\nThe menu offers both killer modern takes on southern\/creole classics (definitely recommend the pork-infused collard greens and grilled-to-perfection ruby red trout) and fun original creations (looking at you bacon popcorn) that keep things interesting without taking you too far out of your comfort zone.\n\nThe kitchen is backed by a great bar, which has a nice selection of craft beers, whiskeys\/bourbons, and cocktails (the Parishioner is a fave). The house-infused spirits are also a must try (I recommend the vanilla rum and the spicy-not-sweet cinnamon whiskey).\n\nThere a couple minor misses (the spicy edamame needs more of a kick and I wish they served something more than the admittedly good bread pudding for desert), but dishes like their take on Mexican street corn (sprinkled with cotijo cheese and just the right amount of heat) more than make up for it.\n\nKicking myself for not trying this one sooner!","1982":"I wanted to like this place ! I have to say I love the ambience and decor. In my opinion I rather come here to sit and drink at the awesome looking bar. First of all like other reviewers have said this is a southern inspired restaurant. We started with the crawfish hush puppies. Those were actually extremely tasty and pretty much on point. They were perfectly fried and spicy! But then I decided to order the drunken angel dish and this is where my experience went down hill. The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly as well as the crawfish and the shrimp. What was most disappointing was the sauce! It lacked any sort of flavor and depth. It basically tasted like butter when it should've been red pepper saffron. Nope ! This was a big bummer! At any rate the bar looks awesome and they have a ton of cool different drinks. Maybe I had the wrong dish :(","1983":"Overly priced for sure. I ordered the chicken salad which had thin layer of chicken just wedged between two whole wheat slices of bread an a side salad. When I had asked my waiter earlier about it, she said, \"should could not speak to it because she was not a fan of mayo\" which seemed like an odd answer from someone who was working there. Nonetheless, the measly sandwich cost me about $13 + the french onion soup was the about the same price which needs more melted gruyere on top. Kids menu - my boys had 1 bowl of $8 butter pasta which was the portion for a 2 year old. My other son had the burger which was fine. My husband had the steak frites and salad and a beer. Total was about $100. It's a shame that it was so dark on the side we ate on.  Another child was blasting their ipad cartoon and no waiter said to lower it because it was completely ruining our lunch. There was a wedding too outside which I would recommend the restaurant just blocking the entire side. I get the charm, but honestly think the whole place needs a renovation.","1984":"We hit this place on Mardi Gras and we were super pumped!! We had reservations but bc of covid restrictions we still had to wait for about an hour after our time to get in. The food and service was fast mainly because they had very limited menu on the holiday. All The grub was spicy just as they do in La and it was a fun atmosphere.  I had the crawfish and my bride had the jambalaya","1985":"One of the best if not the best pasta dishes in town... THE DRUNKEN AGEL... look no further, shrimp and crayfish in a red pepper cream sauce.  I just wanted to climb in the plate and be one with it... ridiculous!  Don't miss the crayfish hush puppies, you can't eat just one!!!","1986":"Went on a Saturday night, which was a mistake because the place was packed at 5:45 and VERY loud. Not a buzz of comforting noise but a ringing and clanking and tinny loud. We were seated near the bar, waited for the third member of the party to join, in an OK spot, except that a radio talk show was being recorded not too far away and their occasional yelling just upped to overall noise level. But whatever, I should have known better. Our waitress came out and had to kneel down so \"we could hear her\" then explained the menu (in too much detail) and left to come back with our drinks. Food was a mixed blessing. The hush puppies were large, moist and delicious, although a tad overdone for my taste. Came with a delicious sweet dipping sauce. I ordered a large salad as well, which was pretty bad. The lettuce leaves were full romaine leaves, hard to eat, plus there was sand or grit in the salad. I could only eat a few bites before I became discouraged that the leaves clearly weren't washed. But it's a dark restaurant so I couldn't see whatever was on the leaves. My husband and I split the salad and he had the same experience - a lot of grit. When I told the waitress, she said, \"are you sure it's not salt and pepper?\" to which I replied with a blank gaze of \"seriously?\" To her credit, I didn't make much of a fuss aside from my facial expression, but she still refunded the whole salad ($10). The burger my husband got was OK, he said, but messy with a bit too much going on. Fries were tasty. My friend really liked his gumbo. Got the bread pudding for dessert. Had a chocolate tinge to it, pretty decent and a huge portion.\n\nWould go for 3-stars but the salad experience sucked since that was all I ordered plus the hush puppies. Service was average; the atmosphere was unpleasant but I'm not big on loudness so part of that is just my own preference. I can handle a little loudness but this was too much. If you go for the food and drinks only, especially if you like cocktails, and you like a (really) loud atmosphere, you'd probably be happy. I suspect the food is pretty decent, I just had bad luck with the salad. There are plenty of five-star reviews, but I'm not a fan.","1987":"Win-Win: we were looking for a good meal en route during travel and were tired of the norm. My husband and son (9) love southern style food. The taste and presentation of the dishes blew us away. As an appetizer, we especially liked the southern style street corn. And you can't go wrong with the hushpuppies. For a main, the shrimp & grits were incredible. We nearly licked our plate clean. Overall: great menu, lots of drink options, attentive, friendly service, topped off with creative decor. My husband has been telling me that southern food can be good, now we finally found a place that proved it!","1988":"Meh. 3.5 stars. I am admittedly a bit of a Francophile. So how exciting to think of an upscale French restaurant tucked away in this unassuming place that is Central NJ. \n... But sadly, I was a bit disappointed. \n\nThe food was good, but not great. The prices high considering the location and the quality. And it wasn't really French food! More... nouveau American. And for that, dear Yelpers, I'd go to the Ferry House in good ole' Princeton instead. \n... But I might return one day. The reason:\n1. The decor \/ Grounds of Sculpture area - ticket price to see the grounds is included in the meal cost\n2. Our server was surprisingly nice despite the snooty attitude from the hostess\n3. Food surprisingly was not overcooked at all - everything was timed just right\n4. THE POPOVERS. ohmygoodness. these are delicious.\n5. Did I mention the popovers?! These little suckers come fresh from the oven and are served piping hot. Be sure to grab 2 (or 3!) because they come around infrequently. If I had a meal consisting only of these, I would rate the place 5 stars. \n\nAnyhoo, to the rest of the meal:\n- Started with the Escargots on a bed of mixed green salad. Highly recommend. In words of Rachel Ray who I would never see touching snails - Yum-O. \n- The other dinner bread they served was unimpressive (choice of baguette, rye bread, raisin bread, and health bread). What the heck is health bread? Pass on this... remember the popovers!\n- I ordered the Halibut. Served over a bed of lobster rice and some steamed veggies. The fillet was an unstingy size, and was cooked particularly well. Very simple though - they offered a cold hollandaise sauce on the side if you desired. Unfortunately, the lobster rice was undercooked and crunchy. Who likes crunchy rice? And the steamed carrots and potatoes uninspiring and bland. \n- Others at my table ordered the following:\no Rack of lamb. Nicely done, not over cooked. \no Veal. $48 for this sucker? Not bad for a dead baby cow (hey, no judgments), but not enough meat or originality to justify the cost. \no Fish (Opakapaka?). A fish similar in texture to tuna. Surprisingly not dry. Not my favorite, but wasn't bad considering. \n- Dessert: Cappuccino layered frozen souffle. Quite tasty. Nothing extraordinary though. Reminded me of something I could buy in a supermarket. A bit more artistically presented of course. \n\nOverall impressions? Cute place. Food was cooked well - timed perfectly so nothing was over-cooked. Nothing was particularly inventive or new. Flavors worked fine together, but mostly because they were so simple. I would go back just for the escargot and the popovers. But yet again, for those prices, I rather learn how to bake popovers myself. I drool even at the thought of those scrumptious little things.","1989":"Great food and atmsophere. Levi was great with the service and conversation. Had the Haitian pork sandwich. Heat was just right for me being from San Antonio. Would definitely eat there again next time I visit Tucson.","1990":"I'm going to really enjoy working my way through this menu over the months ahead. Great respectful staff. Not many restaurants take my mind away from the trivial noise of the day, but this one makes it easy to turn off the phone and enjoy the experience.","1991":"The gumbo is BOMB ! I've been here for brunch and dinner. The food is amazing for both menus!!! The drinks definitely don't disappoint either. I feel like the food is made with care and love. You could taste it with every bite. I highly recommend to anyone! The live music is the icing on the cake. Unfortunately I was too full to try dessert but I'm sure it was delicious too. Worth every penny. I was sad that I couldn't fit any more food in my belly. I had to force myself to stop eating because it was too good to put my spoon down. My waitress was awesome! Actually all the staff members were!","1992":"Extremely tasty bacon popcorn - popped in bacon fat!!!\n(no wonder it's good!)\nyummy cracklins' &  heavenly hushpuppies.\nOK collards.\nCompanion loves the salmon salad - orders it every time.\nNO decent dark beer choices.\nBlack Widow Original Sin Cider - tasty!\nMet the owner - a friendly guy.\nWaiter disappointed us. Forgetting to bring things to the table, seemingly having many other things on his mind. \nHe forgot that we were splitting the check, plus put all appetizers on one person's bill.\nBring a bill to match what each person orders !","1993":"Good atmosphere, sub-par service\nI tried to order drinks at the bar as we were sitting and bar tender refused.. said our server would get our order. Well 20 mins later we FINALLY GOT OUR DRINKS.\n\nAlso ordered a medium burger, got an extra well done...\n\nMezza plate was good but their menu is very limited...\n\nBtw PLACE WAS FREEZING!\nBlamed it on outside yet outside was much warmer...\nRats NEEDS HEAT","1994":"The food sucked!  Tilapia, really.  Cod is the choice for fish & chips, not Tilapia.\nTerrible, terrible, terrible!!","1995":"Staff is always very friendly and the food is delicious! I tried the frog legs for the first time! Not my thing!  but my future father in law loves them! Fish and chips come with so much fish and fries I couldn't eat it all! All the food we had was tasty! The waitress was attentive to our drinks and always coming over when we were stuffing our face.  highly recommend!","1996":"I have been to this restaurant about 3 or 4 times and the food is average at best for the price; however, when it's not cooked properly we have a larger problem then the value.\n\nI had some friends in town for Halloween evening who had never been to the restaurant and wanted to experience the local flare. I ordered the double bone in pork chop as recommended by the waitress. The food came to the table and I cut into my entree which on the surface was prepared adequately but as I moved towards the middle of the double bone in pork chop it became hard to cut as the rigidity of the pork seemed to fight the knife.\n\nAs I was close to being full, I didn't think anything was amiss and got the remaining food to go. The following evening I went to heat up my food when I notice some pink in the middle of the pork. I took a sharp knife and sliced between the bones to discover a dark pink center. This is not what I expected to find but it made the difficulty in cutting the chop from the previous night clearer. If I were  in the restaurant I would have let my server know but since I was home with my leftovers, Yelp is the best way to ensure the quality gets better if this restaurant wants return customers.","1997":"Giving Parish two stars pains me, because I really wanted to like this place. I am a huge fan of hush puppies, gumbo, jambalaya, Abita, the New Orleans Saints, and most things big and easy. Furthermore, Tucson hasn't had a good cajun restaurant since the French Quarter closed years ago.\n\nBecause of all that, I will start by focusing on the good. Parish has some excellent drinks, although their Sazerac is missing absinthe, and their bacon pop corn was a fine accompaniment to the alcohol, if surprisingly less bacony than the name suggests. The fish and chips were exactly what a person wants when they order fish and chips. The gumbo was fine as well. Prices were reasonable. \n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the food my group ordered ranged from bland to unpalatable. The frogs' legs were rubbery, and the bacon overpowered the taste of the frog, possibly for the better. My shrimp po boy looked right, but tasted like bread and not much more. My wife's oyster po boy saw my po boy's bland, and raised it undercooked. The Haitian pulled pork sandwich was really, really hot, which our waitress warned us about, but otherwise tasted mostly like vinegar, which she did not. The hush puppies were dry, dense, and slightly overcooked.","1998":"Fabulous restaurant! The food was wonderful and what a great menu. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. It was so busy we decided to have a drink at the bar and ended up we liked it so much there we ate our dinner there too. Loved how the food was prepared. Next time for sure I will try the popcorn. Great fish.","1999":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Tucson. The service was incredible and the lovely bartender had the best suggestions for cocktails and menu items, all without being pushy! Parish burger and Drunken Angel pasta were PHENOMENAL! I would come over and over just for those Burgundy noodles! The flavors in our cocktails were so perfect you could tell each drink was crafted with care from recipe to glass. We had the best anniversary date here and we will definitely be back!","2000":"Hands down, I will go back just for the drinks. They're strong and tasty. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the atmosphere was nice and chill. Not a big fan on the preparations of the chicken for chicken n waffles meal. They call it sous vide, but my chicken was undercooked. It was runny and had an uncomfortable amount of blood inside it. One server tried to write it off as no big deal, even though the skin was like rubber and the wing was tough to break apart  thank goodness the awesome bartender ask the cook to prepare a new batch of wings; 2nd time was the charm. Anywho, drinks YESSSS, fried chicken NOOOO.","2001":"Great service and good filling food! Free homemade banana bread pudding on your birthday too! \n\n-Hot Legs Le'Jean - bacon wrapped frog legs - definitely was interesting... good but not amazing \n- Black & Blue Brussels - good but a bit too much sauce but the flavor had a little kick to it \n- Gumbo - good\n- Fried Catfish - wasn't a fan \n- Drunk Angel - our favorite","2002":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The pork skins are amazing and a fresh. I love love the gumbo. The hush puppies are very good as well! I go atleast 2 times a month if not more","2003":"Stopped by here to look for a birthday gift. I was greeted by Debi, and she immediately helped me pick out something perfect! Very cute store with unique items, almost all of which are made in the USA, and many that are made locally. I really like this little boutique and will definitely be back soon. Thanks Debi! :)","2004":"Terrific food. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Would definitely recommend","2005":"Great location. I love Grounds for Sculpture. When I entered the restaurant, we had to wait a couple of minutes for somebody to greet us and show us our table. The girl at the entrance was talking at the phone and did not even looked at us. \nThe interior is nice but the food was below my expectations. Octopus too salty, scallops too heavy, my gf's salad and risotto rather bland.\nI will come back in the spring for brunch to give it another chance.","2006":"Service is usually good. Our last waiter wasn't attentive at all. He never told us about the specials, but then later recited them for the table next to us. We had to hunt him down for drinks   because he never checked with us after he gave us our meal. He was more interested in serving his friends next to us. Oh well. This experience was not the norm though. The food is great. Shrimp and grits is my favorite. The portions are for very hungry people, so don't snack before you go there. Atmosphere is fantastic.","2007":"I've been for brunch and dinner. Both experiences were great! The food is a little taste home in the desert. Can't wait to come back","2008":"Obsessed with Parish! Great live music, unique cocktails, and the best burger in town!","2009":"My son and I stopped in on a whim while traveling the back road from Mesa. He got the fish and chips and I got the Parish burger with a salad. The food was great and the service even better. Will be back soon for another great dining experience!","2010":"I am from Louisiana so I usually stay away from Louisiana restaurants. But one of friends insisted we go here. I had the trout and it was really good. I am all about the seasoning!!! I would definitely try this place again. Good food and great service.","2011":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food at The Parish.  Best Gumbo I've had outside of NOLA.  Perfect Hush Puppies and really terrific Homemade Pork Rinds.  I think service could be a bit better, which is why I rate as 4 stars.  More frequent table touches, refreshing beverages and such would have made the difference for me.","2012":"What exactly is a Larkellen? If you take the time to talk to Mimi and her mom, the team behind this beautiful boutique, you'll learn it's a \"Where\", rather than a \"What\", and a whole lot more in the process.\n\nMimi and her mom have created a boutique brimming with beauty, creativity, and lots of conscious products, many made locally or by locally owned companies. From\nFashion to food, this shop has it all! If you're a dude with a beard you best make your way down for the wide array of serums and oils that'll keep yours silky smooth and smelling great! Or perhaps you're looking for a new wallet that is functional and fashionable at the same time. Well they've got you covered there too! Maybe you're after that sweet piece of home decor to round out the room, like an Edison bulb lamp or custom sign, well you should see what's hanging in here. And that only covers a tiny fraction of the funky and fantastic stuff in this shop!\n\nMe, I came in specifically looking for Tahoe Timber sunglasses, locally made shades with bamboo frames! My friend Sydney brought these bad boys to my attention, but sunglasses have always posed an issue for me. First I tend to lose em, so price is an issue. These are $99! Now I still don't wanna lose em, but I'm not out what most might cost of that should happen. I also struggle finding shades that fit and I really like polarized lenses too. Well, I got lucky because these hit the trifecta and I bought a pair without even flinching!\n\nThe stock at the store is constantly changing as they discover new items to carry. I personally brought 3-4 to their attention during my visit and they've since contacted them all about being in the store! So go check this shop out! Whether for yourself, a friend, a family member or just to browse some fun merchandise, you're going to have fun visiting Larkellen!\n\nP.S. Larkellen is actually the street in Santa Monica that the mother half of this dynamic duo grew up on. Surprise em with this fact and they might give you a prize!","2013":"We love the Parish! This spot is located conveniently close to our house and we've been there a few times in the past year since relocating to the area. Favorite dishes include the burger (always more than I can eat, and the flavor delivers) and the Drunken Pasta. You don't find a lot of Cajun\/Creole\/Southern flair in Tucson, so this spot is welcome. Lunch and Happy Hour prices are a good - wish we got to take advantage of those more often! Totally recommend the cocktails and upgrading to the hush puppies for your side - they're super delicious.","2014":"Tweety may have Tawt he taw a puddy tat, but we DEFINITELY smelled a Rat.\n\nYou know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach, when something you've been looking forward to for a very long time finally happens, and it leaves you disappointed, deflated and wondering, WTF? ? Yeah, thank you for this, Rat's.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience having worked for a private event planning company which catered to the rich and the famous, and a certified mystery shopper, I think I can make an educated opinion about our feelings and opinions regarding my husband's and my recent evening with Rat's Restaurant in Hamilton, NJ.\n\nIt all started with our wedding a year ago, when we decided to look for venues to celebrate our very special day. As any couple who is deeply in Love and about to marry the Love of your life knows, this is a BIG deal! \n\nBecause it was closer, and after much consideration, we decided to get married at another location and return to Rat's on another special day, since it was a place we fell in love with at first sight after visiting Grounds for Sculpture but not having time to dine then.\n\nSee where I'm going? We were looking forward to it for a long time.\n\nMy husband, being the stellarly sweet romantic that he is, called the restaurant to make a reservation and request some help in making this a very special day for us. Since the reviews we read raved about the dining experience here, we were expecting, or at least hoping for something a teensy bit more memorable than what we received...\n\nThe Good: The Food and Sights\nThe Bad: The lack of any enthusiasm or desire to help make an evening special.\nThe Ugly: The Complete Lack of Caring.\n\nI get that venues host a myriad of special events and can easily become numb and even jaded to said celebrations, but for the individual it IS an extremely important event, and possibly, once-in-a-lifetime milestone memory.\n\nMaybe bigger events might garner better treatment and attention from Rat's Restaurant team, but they seem to have forgotten that it always begins with the individual, and though taken by the breathtaking beauty of the place, our treatment felt anything but.\n\nMy Full Review can be found at\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=400904327184679&id=100017953443056&__tn__=K-R","2015":"beautiful grounds.   a birthday favorite.  Food is ok, but atmosphere worth the trip!","2016":"I came here for lunch on a beautiful fall day, and I was seated outside. Definitely request this is the weather is nice! The exterior is beautiful and has it's own set of great sculptures for you to view after a long day of strolling the Grounds. \n\nI don't know if I got a French vibe from the food but it does lean a little American, at least for lunch. I rather enjoyed my turkey and croissant sandwich. That dill sauce makes it. My husband ordered the Rat's Burger. Don't let the name fool you, it's tasty and they definitely cook it to your liking. The fries that come with the burger are excellent. Crispy, salty, delectable. This is not the time to ditch the fries. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to go on a nice day, definitely follow the signs and check out the hidden sculptures all around the restaurant. You may join a party or hang out with a fisherman. Either way, I really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant. It's definitely a \"special occasion\" type of establishment. Great place for a date or a small get together. It's a little higher end on the pricing so try to make the most of your time there.","2017":"This place has won many awards for their southern food. It's a nice break for in change of pace of food for Tucson. The drunken angels is what I ordered and is worth the try. It is extremely rich in flavor and all the seafood in it is cooked so perfectly and the pasta was cooked so nicely and so soft and easy to eat. The bacon popcorn is very strong in peeper but a good appetizer to start off with and something different since it is popcorn and the bacon pieces in it is very crispy and tasteful. My friend did order the smokin angel and it was a lot of the tomato not only with the sauce but then they came with a handful of tomato as well. The bread compliments the pasta well. Overall, it is a nice change of cuisine but not my favorite items and flavoring was strong and extremely rich for my taste but seafood was cooked perfectly","2018":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it.  Best dish was definitely the watermelon salad with pork belly.  OMG!  And excellent hush puppies.  I enjoyed the flavors of Drunken angel pasta but the pasta was unfortunately overcooked so the dish came out a little clumpy.  GRRREAT service from our waiter with the Halloween Wayne's World wig\/hat on !!","2019":"This is a great place. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, they have a private room for groups, and they are always friendly. I have been to the Parish many times and I have never been disappointed. Happy hour prices are great! Burgers, fries, and bacon popcorn are all great options. The bloody Mary's are great and they have a wide selection of beers.","2020":"9 out of 5!\n\nI live around the corner from THE PARISH and - gasp - today was my first time eating here. I was told the food is too spicy and everything tastes like bacon. WRONG. The food is outstanding and the flavors are exceptional. \n\nI had trout with fries. Best ever both. Perfectly prepared and HOT from the kitchen. Generous portion. \n\nWife had pasta with lobster sauce and seafood. It was very tasty, she says. I ate most of her saucy pasta and WOW it is amazing. I'm going to order a side of that pasta each visit. Best pasta n Arizona. No contest. \n\nDaughter had two dishes - oysters and frog legs. Oysters were her favorite in lemon butter sauce. Frog was good but not as great. \n\nFriendly and efficient service. Easy to talk. Banquettes on south wall okay for very straight back sitting only. \n\nWill definitely return and recommend. Will bring two large groups in for Sunday brunches soon. \n\nBravo, chef Travis and crew. \n\nSee four photos also of our servings.","2021":"This is our new favorite place for date night. I can see why it won the award for Best Place to take Out of Town Guests. When they're understandably tired of Mexican food, we'll be sure to bring them here. \n\nFrom their cocktails made with their in-house fusions to their Cajun-inspired dishes, this place is a winner in our book. \n\nFor drinks I had their Moscow mule and my husband had their Cinnamon Apple. The Parish offers seasonal cocktails. I'd recommend taking a look at their Instagram (@theparishtucson) for drool-worthy pictures. \n\nWe had their hush puppies, salmon verlasso, and shrimp and grits. Next time we'll have to try the bacon popcorn - I've heard it's a must!\n\nWhen leaving, I noticed they do weekly live music. We can't wait to go back!","2022":"So much fun and the only thing better than the service was the FOOD!!  There were 10 of us so we were able to snack on a little bit of everything... the bacon popcorn is always good, hush puppies and cornbread were awesome, and OMG with the street corn!!!!   I ordered the smokin angel for dinner because I love it - it tastes exactly the same every time!!  The new salmon dish was also a hit at the table!  So. Much. Deliciousness.  \nThank you Travis, Bryce, and Lawson for taking such great care of us!!","2023":"The food here is amazing! The brunch is our favorite. The braised \"bacon and eggs \" is my personal favorite.","2024":"We had take out from the Parish, and the food was very good! I had the shrimp and grits, and the sauce is amazing! My husband really enjoyed his steak, and the cornbread is delicious! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the cocktails we got seemed to be a little weak\/watered down, but that could be from the ice melting (to go cocktails may be a bad idea in Arizona). Overall a good experience!","2025":"This is the coolest place in Tucson, AZ!!! It has a fabulous ambience and local art. The food is absolutely delicious. If your ever in Tucson, AZ forget about downtown. This place is where it's at for food, art, music and a good night out!!!","2026":"Our lunch was just okay, I do not recommend hamburger here. The meat was dry... It was not crowded on a weekday, but our server was inattentive. Would not return.","2027":"Rats does not consider  vegan\/ vegetarian  guests :-(","2028":"I have eaten at Rat's dozens of times and wanted to weigh in on the varied reviews. I am a member of GFS so this restaurant is always handy when walking the grounds or attending openings or events here. For those who have never visited GFS, I highly recommend visiting(on a weekday preferably) and spending a few hours walking the grounds and exploring the exhibits in the buildings. The best time to visit is after the new seasonal openings(the next one will begin May 10th) if you visit before this date you may not be able to enjoy the exhibits in the buildings which could still be in the installation process. After enjoying the art, Rat's is a good choice to relax at. For economic reasons, the Happy Hour is your best choice, although lunch is not too expensive either. During H.H. you have a variety of reduced price appetizers to choose from, and each day has different drink specials, all days have half price wines by the glass though. The bar itself is small but very nicely decorated, but in good weather try to sit outside where you will see a nice view of part of the park and a french inspired lake setting. The sommelier, and wine cellar at Rat's are both probably the best that central NJ has to offer, and even wine snobs will be able to find excellent bottles here. The service is uneven. Some servers are great, some are not. This has been an ongoing problem that seems to have improved slightly in the last year. The issue that I have noticed is that not all servers are knowledgeable in regards to the menu. And some don't notice empty glasses, or offer bread or popovers unless asked. A note on the bread, I am happy to see that 3 kinds of bread have been available lately, my favorite being an excellent raisin nut bread. And during the dinner service fresh popovers are distributed. As far as the food itself, competent but sometimes uninspiring is the best way to sum it up. Some items are consistently very good(scallops, duck, chicken come to mind) And other items are are merely satisfactory. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients themselves are great quality, and always plated nicely. But it seems to me that the chefs don't always have their heart in it. The menu does not change as much as other high quality restaurants, and when it does it is usually just a tweak on an older version of the recipe. When specials are offered I usually opt for these. This restaurant does offer 2 very nice perks that other places in the area don't, for dinner you are served an amuse bouche in the beginning, and a \"sweet\" tray with your check. If you like attending wine dinners, this is a great place to try. I have attended several here and they are my best experiences in this restaurant. In this setting the chefs do impress. To finally sum up this long winded review, I do recommend Rat's as a place everyone in the area should try, with the location and decor it is unique. Some people will really enjoy the food, but all will remember the experience.","2029":"Excellent customer service and the food was amazing! My hubby had the gumbo, note, a bowl is gigantic! I had shrimp po boy which like the gumbo was absolutely delicious. Did I mention the French fries? They're a must! This was our first visit and we will be back","2030":"A group of us went here a couple of months ago and all had a nice dinner. I had fish and chips and the bread pudding was great, considering I don't even like bread pudding!","2031":"BLUF: Cold and tasteless food. Good service and the only thing giving this place more than one star...the drinks. \n\nWe came in with expectations of at least good food, but the result was anything but.  The Eggplant burger was cold and only one incredibly small slice of eggplant.  The chile relleno appetizer was small and you guessed it...cold. The pasta dish was HORRIBLE. BBQ sauce and angel hair pasta! What a treat.  \n\nAll I have to say is, don't go. If you do...stick to bourbon and hushpuppies. What an EPIC disappointment.","2032":"This was one of my favorite places in Tucson but when I went last week our server was rude and barely came to check on us. We were seated outside and the restaurant had one other couple inside. Every time I ordered a cocktail she was almost mad I ordered something and I asked twice for cheese on my burger and never got it. Just hope you don't get an older blonde lady serving you and you should have a great experience .","2033":"Been to NOLA many times and surprised by how authentic this place was. Very impressive Cajun style restaurant in Tucson","2034":"Excellent food and stellar service! Highly recommend the Goat Cheese Relleno, the Gumbo and the pasta. Would come back in a heart beat!","2035":"Not a bad place, but limited menu with mediocre food that is very over priced!! \n\nBeen here 4 or 5 times over the years.\n\nWon't be back in less I have to?\n\nNice ambience however.","2036":"My husband and I went here for lunch for the first time last Saturday. First we waited almost a half an hour for the French onion soup. Then another half an hour for the food. If it was going to be that long the waitress should've at least mentioned that it was going to take a while. I ordered the trout, I knew right when I saw it that I was still going to be hungry afterwards. My husband ordered a burger and fries. Bacon was a bit burnt, but he didn't mind. A few of the fries were normal size, most of them are all just little nubs. Like we got the bottom of the bag. Server wasn't that great. She walked by the table many times, not noticing that my water was empty. Just wasn't really pleased with the service. Food was OK. May or may not return.","2037":"When we made the reservation through Open Table, there was no indication there would be a limited menu. My wife had the crab and risotto which consisted of two tiny crab claws in a sea of risotto. Tremendously over priced appetizer sized serving. I had short rib, which was like an overcooked piece of roast. Not tender or particularly tasty, fairly dry and tough. This had been a special occasion place for us because in the past it was very good with an interesting menu. When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the manager when we were leaving, he was \"sorry\". Service was unimpressive. Drinks and service at the bar were good as usual.","2038":"I write this review asking every retired military person to not go to this restaurant. Recently, we called The Parish to make a reservation for a group of 14-20 veterans\/military retires and their spouses, whom get together once a month a different Tucson area restaurants to talk, enjoy each others company, while enjoying good food. However, The Parish, was not only very reluctant to host our group they couldn't even be bothered to return our call when they said they would call back. So we have chosen to have our November get together at the Canyon's Crown, they were very happy to host our group.","2039":"I was really hoping to give this place a better rating.  I would give it 3.5 stars but, you know, only whole stars.  Service was definitely a 5 star rating.  The waitress was super, super nice and the gentlemen that was tending the bar was great.  They gave us suggestions on the beer and gave us samples before we decided.  I had read a lot about the Dragoon IPA and really wanted to try it.  It was just not my cup of tea.  Very strong in flavor and really hindered the floral and citrus notes.  My wife and I loved the Red Rover much more.  They have several small micro-brews which is a huge bonus if you like that sort of thing and we do. Appetizers were the bacon wrapped frog legs and bacon popcorn.  The frog legs were AWESOME and a must have when you go here.  The popcorn on the other hand, not so great for us.  I am guessing that it is popped in bacon grease with a few pieces of bacon scattered throughout.  The bacon was, for the most part extremely burnt an gave the popcorn a burnt flavor.  It was also greasy.  I know, I know, what was I expecting, right?  I was just to greasy for us.  Entrees were the Warpig and the Oyster Po' Boy.  My wife really loved the Warpig.  I mean seriously, what's not to love about a Hebrew National 1\/4 lb hotdog (my favorite hotdog by the way) wrapped in bacon (something ironic about that) smothered in every other part of the pig, pulled pork, ham and homemade pork rinds.  The pork rinds I could have done without, somewhat tasteless.  Separately all of the parts tasted great, but together, something was a miss.  I am not sure if it was the creole mustard or what, but together they gave off a sour and salty taste.  I just didn't really like it.  The Oyster Po' Boy was great.  The oysters were perfect and had a nice salty, fishy taste, which I like.  Again, we really enjoyed our stop here but I am just not sure.  I love supporting the local economy and would probably go back now that we know what we like and dislike.","2040":"The gastropub is home to southern fusion cuisine and comfort food in a charming setting with rustic table settings under glass chandeliers. The menu offers distinct flavors from Louisiana, Texas, and Arizona. I decided on the cajun flavor of the gumbo and hushpuppies. The hushpuppies were worth a separate side order. The Big Hippie bunhugger featured a \"tender\" housemade roasted eggplant.","2041":"I made the mistake of eating here post Sunday brunch.\n\nMy server, and I don't exaggerate in the least, was clearly upset we sat down. \n\nI did not know they stopped taking tables at 5pm. Perhaps me asking for a dinner menu could have triggered a conversation about that. Instead, however, my waitress started looking at her watch, and she wasn't wearing a watch, I kid you not. I got the fake watch glance because we didn't pick entrees fast enough. One more time for the people in the back, my waitress looked at her wrist pretending she had a watch to signal that we should leave. \n\nI should have known at the beginning she was not interested in working anymore when she couldn't even get out the 'tap or bottled water' without completely zoning out. \n\nI was told not to order an entree, because we should 'split one'. Also, when my date asked about the steak, out waitress literally wondered off while she was speaking to us. Me and my date we're both laughing at the absurdity of it all. \n\nKeep in mind, the restaurant is full, this is far from chairs up time. This waitress, Akira, was so cashed out, she was totally unwilling to do her job in the slightest fashion. \n\nAfter jokingly asking for coffee, because I could only imagine the reaction I would receive, she proceeded to  complain about the six top she had. 'they ordered something crazy, Sam something' uh huh... Sambuca? 'no no'. Then she Google's it 'Drambuie, now who ever heard of that, I had to ask the bartender where it was, he said cordials, people are crazy'\n\n\nI managed to ask her how long she has been there, totally expecting a few weeks, she says... Drum roll. A year and a half. Holy crap. \n\nI had an honest debate with my associate I was eating with if our waitress was mentally stable. We went with a firm, no. \n\nAlso, what I'll never understand, if you want a table out, you need to move through steps of service. Drop a check for Christ sake. You want me gone, but you won't let me pay? The manager ended up running my payment.\n\nI also happened to speak to the manager on duty, sweet women, but beat to hell. I didn't bother mentioning Akira being an insane person, the manager looked fairly broken. I am not in the business of beating a dead horse. The manager gave us 10% without prompting because 'we were cool'. I assume she had an idea of what we went through.\n\nThe morale of this review is this, I got the worst service of my life at Ratz and for that I am somewhat entertained. However, at the same time, the experience left me feeling, dirty. Honestly, I felt like I was in a restaurant sitcom, canned laughter, trite personality traits, arguments among the staff, management, and the staff talking badly about another table to us, I mean, it just hit all the hot points. \n\nThe cheese plate was good, and the escargot was equally good. \n\nAfter a long journey in the garden, this was an interesting cap off to a long trip. \n\nI overheard Akira telling her six top that 'this isn't Applebees' I could agree more Akira, it's Chuck-E-Cheese.\n\n\nAnyway, I'll never be back, and God bless the wayward restaurant souls who find themselves in this obviously sinking ship. \n\nP.S. - when I arrived, from the garden, you walk through the restaurant to get to the front. Up front some horrifying uninformed guests were arguing with the matre d and hosts about why they moved them off a table by the water. I want to express the sympathy I feel for the staff, because the incident at the host stand, having to pull goofy people from those tables, probably happens 100 times a day. These brilliant guests were arguing with the restaurant staffs right to ask them to get up from a table they just wondered up to. I can only imagine how unbearable that is, to do that over and over, and to the host \/ matre d credit, they handled it very well. The younger host, who kind of looked like the kid from home alone, really wanted to scream at them. Like I said, restaurant sitcom. \n\nAlways tip 20% kids, no matter what. I know I did. Perhaps that perpetuates 'Akira' type service, I had a minor moral crisis looking at the tip line. However, at the end of the day, you need to do what's right.","2042":"We found the restaurant through Yelp. And saw all of the positive reviews. We were seated promptly and our waitress took our drink orders my wife picked a nice Sauvignon blanc and I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. My first whiskey choice wasn't available so I ordered a single malt . The drinks arrived and I thought it was a sample taste as it barely met the 3\/8\" of ice at the bottom of the glass. I tasted it and found out that was my drink. Now I order this type of drink all the time, and know what is expected. A lady served us our food other than our server and my wife spoke up and complained about the drink. The lady said \" Now this is my favorite bartender he couldn't have made a mistake\". Anyway our food was excellent we had the bacon popcorn and I ordered the $29 steak and my wife the burger. Both were delicious and our original server was excellent. For this reason we are leaving 3 stars. If they poured a fair $9 drink then it would have been 5 stars. I would return for the food but forget the bar drinks !","2043":"The food at the Parish was mind-blowing. This restaurant offers Southern-inspired cuisine in a super trendy atmosphere, and every dish I tried was amazingly delicious in its own way! To start, we ordered an appetizer (\"Noshes\") of the cast iron cornbread, made with blue corn, honey, and cinnamon, and topped with a scoop of sweet bourbon butter. This might've been one of the best cornbreads I've had--it was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and the sweet bourbon butter added an amazing sweet and savory flavor that paired perfectly with the blue corn! \n\nAnd then came our mains. One of the most popular dishes at the Parish is the Drunken Angel pasta, and I can see why! This dish was made with burgundy-colored angel hair pasta in a saffron red pepper cream sauce and lobster broth, along with plenty of shrimp and crawfish, and topped with an unbelievable amount of parmesan cheese! The seafood and the pasta weren't overcooked and maintained a nice texture, but the real highlight was the super decadent cream sauce, which had a complex spicy, savory, garlicky, umami flavor! The pasta also came with a generous slice of buttered garlic bread, which was perfect for mopping up the rest of the sauce on the plate! \n\nFinally, to finish off, we had the Mesquite Smoked Salmon salad. On top of a mixture of simple field greens came spiced candied pecans, pomegranate seeds, golden raisins, crispy lardons (bacon bits), red onions, jicama, and of course, crumbled smoked salmon, along with a spicy green onion vinaigrette on the side. Whoever came up with this combination of ingredients was genius--the pecans, pomegranate seeds, and golden raisins each contributed a unique touch of sweetness that paired perfectly with the smokiness of the lardons and the salmon. The vinaigrette added just the right amount of acid to bring all the components together, highlighting the refreshing crunch of the greens, jicama, and onions! \n\nWhen I visit restaurants, I can usually name the dish that I liked best, but everything I tried at the Parish was amazing in its own way. What incredible dishes all around, and what an incredible, inventive restaurant!","2044":"This restaurant is funky looking, but it has great cajun\/creole food.\nI particularly like their seafood gumbo. Delicious!","2045":"Good food for a good price! The waiter was very accommodating in serving us family style to our large group. The food was unique and very tasty! We were all very impressed!","2046":"Really like this Louisiana-influenced restaurent.  The menu is unusual and creative.  Best bread pudding in Tucson!","2047":"I am still in awe of my experience here. The hush puppies were absolutely amazing, I have never tasted anything like them before. The corn bread was the perfect texture, was delivered warm, and the honey melted right off the top. The burger had crispy bacon and a creamy sauce. The drinks were refreshing and the dessert with heavenly. I cannot wait to come back!","2048":"This is the perfect place to get away from eating the norm. I love the bacon popcorn, and hushpuppies. The gumbo is my go to entree.  I'm glad we chose to order take out and support this local gem during the government shut down.","2049":"This used to be my favorite restaurant. A friend who later started a food tour company brought our soccer team to eat shortly after they opened. I have been a loyal customer ever since. I have been eating here since before they took over the water store next door to expand. \n\nI went to the parish for lunch today. It was about 2:00 pm, and there were only three tables of customers who had already been served. The sign said \"seat yourself.\" I walked in and sat down. The bartender\/waitresses were engaged in a long conversation with someone (a photographer I think) for a while talking about v day reservations. I sat there for a while. No menu. No water. After I had been waiting over fifteen minutes, five people walked in. A blonde bartender\/waitress in a black shirt literally jumped up. I watched to see if she was grabbing me a menu. Once I realized she was counting out menus for the late comers, I made eye contact with her. She briefly made eye contact then looked away. When I heard her immediately take their drink orders, I got up and left. Neither bartender\/waitress so much as acknowledged me the entire time I was there. Unfortunately, me and the Parish are done.","2050":"Don't normally right reviews; however, the Alabama Stuffed quail was on the best meals I've had in a while. \n\nGood atmosphere, good beer selection and good whiskey... not much else you need","2051":"The place's decor is amazingggggggg. It is like going into an alice in wonderland place. There is indoor\/outdoor and we sat on the outdoor place with willowy trees by the water... the colors were so pretty and the view is very beautiful. This is one of the most beautiful place i have ever been to. This place passed my expectations. We went there for brunch on a sunday morning and it was a very lovely experience. It seemed like we walked into a fairytale palace. After eating, we walked around the place...the decor was amazing..the flowers...the figurines...and walking by the lake...feels like its a half museum. There is even a gift shop next to the restaurant with mist coming out...its a place worth going to even if you are hours away. The food was soso.. but i didnt really care that much bc the place is worth the time and money spent. French food isnt exactly appetitzing to me, but love the place. Request to sit outside!!","2052":"Meh. I could not eat the fish dinner\/black rice at all. Too greasy, too bland, & too much everything. I wondered how their Yelp rating was the 4.5 starts. The service was good , though.","2053":"A unique gem in Tucson,with the best mixologist in Az. Hand infused liquors,fresh squeezed juices,boutique custom cocktails,great beers. Now lets talk food ,OMG its just delicious. I have always received great service and amazing food and appetizers. Gumbo and hush puppies are right out of the Big Easy. The shrimp and grits,steak and frits are to die for! Don't come to Tucson and miss a chance at a great dining experience. Hands down the best restaurant in Az.","2054":"Everything was great. Everything was delicious! I am so glad we got to try this place in tucson. You can tell the staff and kitchen cares about their food and are so proud of what they are doing. \nOne of Tucson's gems! \n\nFood was very flavorful. Everything we ordered was delicious. They seriously had he best collard greens I've ever had in my life!!\n\nTheir patio is dog friendly.","2055":"This is a Great place to find Cajun flavors with a clean fun atmosphere. The waitstaff is attentive and I am always able to get a table quickly. Also on a side note, this is one of the only places in town to get Andygator.","2056":"It's happening again....I'm eating, I'm drinking, I'm sitting in the restaurant and I'm reviewing. I feared my first experience was too good to be true but here I am 7 months later and I'm back in heaven!\n\nThe food is great.\nThe staff is super friendly.\nThe wine is delicious. \nThe atmosphere is lovely.\n\nI got the Happy Hour $5 gumbo and compressed watermelon + pork belly salad. Good God man. The FLAVORS! The cup of gumbo looked small but it's taking me forever to eat, it's just too good to rush. And I don't know what it is about this pork belly but it's like crunchy, fluffy, borderline-guiltless meat fat. That's a raging compliment in case it didn't translate. It's just TOO good to care about calories (and I care *a lot* about calories).\n\nI'm heartbroken to say that I will no longer be working in Arizona come 2021 but I plan to \"vacation\" in Tucson just to eat here. It's too yummy to just be a good memory.\n\nKEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING PARISH!! If you ever expand, please come to San Diego.","2057":"Come with an appetite... the portions are large, heavy, and rich, but incredibly delicious. I have yet to find something I didn't like on the menu... food or booze-wise...","2058":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was a first for him and it had been several years since I had been. Everything. Was. Amazing. \nWe started with the P. E. I. Mussels and they were fantastic. So full of flavor, and just absolutely to die for. \nFor dinner he got the grilled Ruby Red Trout and I tried the quail! I was pleasantly surprised by all the flavors on my dinner plate. If you've never tried quail and feel like it's time to do so, do it here! My BF devoured his fish. \nOnly downfalls: BF doesn't like collared greens or anything similar, but we weren't told about being able to substitute the Blivens Greens until after we were done eating and the waitress noticed it was the only thing left on either plate. Small inconvenience, we didn't ask and she didn't tell. Second: BF had a Jack & Coke, nothing special there, but he said it tasted watered down and like there wasn't hardly any alcohol to be had in it. \nOverall, a successful birthday dinner though. Gotta check this place out!","2059":"In all fairness, this place is good for a certain kind of diner and customer. If you like a party, a loud atmosphere and drinking--you will probably rate it much higher. That said, the food wasn't great. Again, if you like heavy, greasy, deep fried food--you may like it more. I went with spouse and a friend on a night when the place was hosting a live talk-radio show. It was insanely loud, and very dark. The waitress had to bend down so she could be heard. I don't get what's so wonderful about not being able to talk because a restaurant is SO loud. Anyway, the cornbread was good. The hush puppies were overcooked, the jambalaya was serviceable, and my salad had sand (or sandy dirt) in it. There was nothing relaxing or satisfying about the experience. If you dislike loud restaurants and overrated food (especially if you are from the Louisiana area) avoid this place. Why it is has such high ratings is a bit of a mystery but I suspect it's the type of cuisine and bar scene combined...plus there aren't many (or any?) other Cajun options in Tucson. Maybe we just went on a bad night in the kitchen, exacerbated by coerced listening to talk radio.","2060":"I think I bookmarked this place over a year ago... and we finally tried it.  We live on the east side in Vail, so it is a bit of a hike coming over the this side of town for dinner but it was TOTALLY worth it.\n\nLoved that they took reservations, although we did not really need it.  We were seated at a two top against the wall.  The dining area is small-ish charming, with local artistry on the wall.  I noticed they had what appeared to be a private dining area which is pretty cool.\n\nOur server was very friendly and good.  We ordered a cocktail (off the holiday drink menu), crayfish hush puppie appetizer, shrimp and grits and a drunken steak.  All of the good was great and super tasty.  I was obsessed with my husbands fries... he was obsessed with my collard greens.  We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert.  So that was probably the one pain point of an otherwise fantastic dining experience.  It seemed sort of stale or too cold.  The first bite and all the layers just fell away from each other... kind of strange.  As big dessert people, we left about half of it (or more) which is not like us.  \n\nI would totally recommend anyone I know visiting the Parish... at least once; food, ambiance and service on point!","2061":"Very good food shrimp and grits and the steak were the hit of the table! The doctor was a great cocktail mix on the specialty cocktail list! Nice job would definitely go again. The service was great!","2062":"What a stunning restaurant  we had to wait about an hour despite having a reservation just to get a table by the water but it was totally worth the wait! \nTheir Bellinis were impeccable and kept flowing. Should you choose to go to the Grounds for Sculpture park, definitely plan a few relaxing hours at the Rat's restaurant taking in the beauty of the nature around you and prepare to be surrounded by the little ducklings and koi fish asking for food (they are not to be fed though, don't let those hungry eyes staring at you fool you! Bread isn't good for them)","2063":"Oh my gosh! I'm in Tucson visiting family. Before coming, my daughter looked for restaurants to visit. I have been friends with people from Southern Louisiana for close to 50 years and I have had different gumbos. My BFF, from Baton Rouge, made the best gumbo I've ever had. The Parish's gumbo is a very close second best. For the price, they give you a large portion. \nNow for the service. We were seated right away. Our server, Chelsea, was the best! She took our drink orders right away. The food came out at the perfect time and it was delicious! Everyone was so nice and accommodating. I definitely will visit them again. If I was flying home instead of driving I would freeze some gumbo for my daughter and I! \nTo recap: Delicious food, good value for the price and friendly staff. You can't go wrong eating at The Parish!","2064":"This place is a must go. Absolutely loved it here. Make sure to check out the museum and the garden sculptures after you eat. Also try to reserve a table just in case they are full as they asked if we had reservations. \n\nFood: In regards to the food, very well done. From the history in terms of where and how it was made, and they added a very nice touch in noting which farms the ingredients for the food where taken from. Our group tried and enjoyed both the deviled eggs as well as the escargot. Both were excellent, with the escargot being one of the best we'd experienced. The French onion and Oyster Chowder soups were incredible, and we could certainly see why their French onion soup has been a menu staple for over a decade. The entrees were hard to manage after such a stacked experience with the appetizers and accompaniments, but they were equally as appealing and were very well cooked and presented. Overall, an amazing experience. \n\nAmbience: The environment for Rat's likely couldn't be better, and they execute well in regards to their incorporation of the Garden of Sculpture artworks, as well as their own personal touches in order to give the restaurant its own personal flare. With ornate curtains, clean silverware, and a gorgeous view of a lake, Rat's certainly out does competitors when it comes to style. \n\nService: Our waitstaff were incredibly well-informed, and as they worked as a duo, we were never without when it came to extra additions to our food or drinks. Our initial waiter also was the one that provided the information for the drinks, and it was well received that he could place his personal recommendations for Bloody Mary drinks, outside of his own kitchen. There was a third individual who was willing to clear our table and went out of his way to answer our questions as well. In the end, we had a very pleasant waitstaff experience, and appreciated their service.","2065":"A beautiful restaurant set on Monets Garden in NJ Grounds for Sculpture. Excellent food. Peach Bellini, Trout, Cranberry bread pudding.  But constant removing of plates while others eating, desert sitting with ice cream but no ordered coffee, one spoon to stir coffee and eat desert and then the check came before I asked","2066":"Cool stuff! Cool people!!\nI found something for everyone on my Christmas list. So nice to shop at an owner-operated store with NV pride!","2067":"By far my favorite restaurant in town, the service is great, the decor is perfect, but the food is what really keeps me coming back for every possible reason (holidays, celebrations, I happen to be breathing that day, etc..) \n\nHighly recommend!","2068":"I wish I would say more about this place, but I wasn't very impressed. Service was good, but the food seemed to be lacking. I had the chicken gumbo, which didn't have much flavor and wasn't very hot. The cornbread was okay, nothing special, and prices were a bit a high in my opinion for what you get. I've ate all over New Orleans and while they try at the Parish and put a hipster twist on it, I don't think they come very close to what the food is really supposed to be.","2069":"The restaurant and area surrounding the restaurant are beautiful and unique. Our waitress was also very sweet and knowledgeable. So these stars are for the ambiance and service. However for the price you are paying, the food is only sub-par. I tried a watermelon sangria which tasted extremely watery and not like watermelon at all. I had a sip of my cousins blood orange cocktail which also tasted watery. We ordered a cheese platter and tried all five of the cheeses which were good and some octopus which was also decent (but could use a little more flavor). For the main course, I ordered the lamb which was overdone and not flavorful enough IMO, my cousin had scallops and her husband had the fillet mignon. We all tried each other's dishes and I found that theirs lacked flavor too. For dessert my cousin ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was fine. \n\nApparently this place has a good brunch and I definitely want to check out the grounds for sculpture since we didn't have enough time before dinner. I don't think I would return for dinner though...","2070":"I did enjoy the atmosphere and the food looked amazing but the special of the night was quail. Halfway through the first of 2 small quails I find that the legs are still raw. I let the waiter know and they fixed me a new plate, but by the time they finished cooking the second plate, my wife was already done with her meal and we were ready to go. We were really hopping for a great experience and the cooks let us down.","2071":"Totally great experience. Our Server Duane was super cool. The entire staff seemed happy to be there. It was a great atmosphere. Great Bourbon Street vibe all the way.","2072":"We have dinned at Rat's many times over the last 4 years. The restaurant is lovely and food excellent. Tonight we noticed some changes were made when we entered. Unfortunately, it was not the Rat's we knew and loved. Service at the bar was slow and the bar tenders did not want to make eye contact despite the bar not being crowded. After we were seated for dinner it was all down hill. We were so surprised. Service and food was less that poor. The waiter appeared angry with us and was just annoyed he had to wait on us. Bread was stale, hazelnuts on salad was rancid, our boullabaisse's fish was over cooked and the dish smelled fishy - not edible. The bus boy cleared our plates and no one came over to ask how dinner was that evening. We did not get dessert or coffee. We were heartbroken this gem of a restaurant was no longer. Not sure what happened tonight, I hope for their sake it was a one off because if not they will be closing their doors soon.","2073":"I appreciate that the chef was able to tone down the heat for my visiting parents. \nI always enjoy the gumbo and friendly staff.","2074":"So happy to have found good Cajun food in Tucson. Delicious. Will be visiting regularly :)","2075":"Amazing brunch with such creative dishes and beverages!!!","2076":"Wonderful food in a pretty setting with great service.\nSplit pea soup was among great with a slight hint of lemon. The shrimp salad was 4 xlarge shrimps on a bed of greens. The shrimps were cooked and came out warm with a nice sauce. The croque madame was not quite the way they make it in France, but it was good. Great baguette came with lunch. The special lemonade was cherry and very tasty without being overly sweet.\nTwo small drawbacks,. The restaurant was cold and never seemed to heat up and the lunch progressed and there is a detour getting to Rats if you are coming up Rt 1, so you end up going thru a sketchy area.","2077":"50-ish brunette woman at the front door was very unfriendly, when I left I said \"thank you have a great day\" she simply looked at me turned around and walked away. Too many options in the area to not be treated with just a little bit of friendly human kindness.","2078":"I ordered the pork chop and found it covered in yummy sauce but the sauce hid a rather tough hunk of pork. I'm not impressed. \n\nThe service was excellent. The atmosphere was loud and friendly and fun. It was a busy night with live music. \n\nI'm in no hurry to return.","2079":"Very good first experience here and I am thinking to come back soon already. Tried the crawfish hushpuppies and frog legs, and enjoyed both. The hushpuppies had the right amount of crisp and went well with their sweet dipping sauce. The frog legs wrapped with bacon goodness were toothsome as well. Besides, they had live music and great service.","2080":"Not a Great Birthday Celebration\nWe've had many calibrations at Rats over the years and have always had a great time with great service. Unfortunately we had a very different experience when we celebrated my Mother's 74th birthday this past Sunday. We were a party of 9. We were the only table occupied on the second floor. The service was very slow and a bit odd. Most of us ordered the French onion soup and all felt it tasted off, two sweet? Most of us also had the steak frites, the fries were amazing as were the greens, unfortunately we all felt the steak was tough\/rubbery - some people ordered it medium rare, some medium - all felt the same. I will say the 2 people who got the escargot appetizer and the burger entree enjoyed them. The chocolate dessert was good, but the carrot crepe cake was not(it was like they forgot the sugar). My mom ordered ice cream and I was very disappointed that the restaurant couldn't spare a piece of cake to stick the candle into instead of putting it into the ice cream. They did write happy birthday on the ice cream plate but it was very odd. All in all a very disappointing outing.","2081":"Parish claims to have the best fish and chips.  Beware!  They use Talapia, claiming that is is the freshest fish available. By his is what the waiter said.  Yuck! For those who know good fish and chips also means quality fish...Like halibut or cod.  Not Talapia.  Poor choice.  We won't be back!","2082":"This Louisiana inspired restaurant is fantastic. Delicious food, great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Unique, handcrafted cocktails as well. The cornbread with bourbon butter is amazing!","2083":"I've dined at Rats 5 times prior, but had yet to try their Brunch.  So, we  made a reservation for their New Year's Day Brunch. The brunch is set-up in the Rats Kitchen, which is a nice touch.  We were able to go in and out as many times as we liked to obtain our food.  \n\nAll the meals that I have had here have been wonderful.  A Buffet is always hard to maintain with the quantity of food being cooked, so somethings were a bit overcooked and others were cold.  Par for the course for a Brunch Buffet, but the overall quality of the food was very good and also had ample vegetarian selections. If you want to treat yourselves for a special occasion, it's a nice option.  \n\nAmbiance: For me, this is the main draw to this restaurant.  I'm transported to a different time and place; the landscape, flora and sculptures are breath taking.  The entire scene lends itself to amazing photographs. I love the peaceful and serene environment created here.  If you have time, go visit the adjoining Grounds for Sculpture which is amazing as well.\n\nFood:  The food is expensive, but think of it as part entrance fee to roam about the gardens at Rats (in nicer weather, of course).  Considering the pricey menu, the Brunch is reasonably priced. \n\nService:  Our server was very good.  He was friendly, efficient, and kept our coffees replenished.  \n\nSpecial Events:  Rats throws some great special events throughout the year including a Dance Club Night, Salsa Night, and a Halloween Party.  I've attended all of them and have had an amazing time at each.  The events do get quite crowded.","2084":"Love it! Come here for happy hour every time I'm in town visiting my parents. Friendly staff. Best bacon popcorn and they serve ICE COLD Shiner on tap. Amazing. Really cool atmosphere too.","2085":"After living in Louisiana for a time I was really looking forward to some great cajun food.\nI read the menu and my mouth was watering!!! Unfortunately the menu descriptions are the best thing about the food. It seems to me that perhaps the traditional spices that make up the cajun dishes have been toned down for the Tucson audience. There were several of us and we had 7 dishes between us and nothing really said \"This is awesome.\" The food is not bad, its just not great.","2086":"Fabulous little restaurant. I found the service to be super friendly and prompt. I really enjoyed the selection of cocktails, and my dad and husband were super stoked to try some new beers that they loved. My husband got a burger, which was gigantic and super flavorful. I settled for the chili relleno appetizer which was lovely. The bread pudding at the end of the night was the real show stopper. This isn't a cheap restaurant but the food was good enough and the portions were hearty enough to justify a higher price. I can't wait to go back!","2087":"Quite tasty food, quite bad service: didn't bring things we ordered, checked in 3 times over the course of an hour. Also a beautiful spot to eat.","2088":"We had the drunken angel and the gumbo. The drunken angel was pretty tasty, though they probably should package pasta seperate from the sauce on to go orders as the end product needed more bite...probably better for dine in. The gumbo was good, but the rice was not. Mostly turned off by having to give my credit card over the phone and not getting a receipt.","2089":"This place always has fun, unique gifts. I can always find something that someone else will love and treasure! There is always a large selection of items for men, women, and children. I also love the wonderful stock of Tahoe and Nevada items. The customer service is truly exceptional!!!!!","2090":"This food was really good!! We got the drunken angel pasta with shrimp, crawfish, and lobster broth. Really seasoned and delicious. Savory and amazing.","2091":"One of my favorite places in Tucson. Excellent drinks, service, and everything on the menu is delicious. Sunday brunch is a must- order the mother trucker and a southern belle to wash it down, I promise you won't be disappointed.","2092":"I have been to Rat's before and always enjoyed it...but never made it to brunch. I'm glad I finally did. The food was amazing! Totally worth the price! I love brunch and have been to many around me in Bucks County and in Philly (and in Vegas)...this is one of the absolute best!","2093":"Food is good. They did ask us to leave after we finished our food as they had a reservation  coming in and wanted to use our table. I found that very rude . This happened 6\/15\/18 in the evening. I wanted to bring my family when they come into town but I will go else where. We like to eat and chat not eat and run.","2094":"We were in Tucson to visit Saguaro National Park for 5 days and this was by far our best meal.  We shared the cornbread and she had shrimp and grits which were excellent. I had the giant short rib which lives up to its name!  If you order I hope you are hungry.  It was awesome as well.  All around a great experience.","2095":"Great Louisiana inspired fare with a creative twist. Their cocktails are also creative and delicious and the decor is interesting and unique. This is a favorite happy hour spot for us but is also great for brunch, lunch or dinner. They also put on good events with live music.","2096":"Parking:  Open, lots of free parking \nWait was a an hour for a table for 8. \n\n\nLA native review. \nI ordered the Drunken angel and the crawfish was really well seasoned.  This was one of my favorite things I have tried all weekend. It was a creamy pasta with well-cooked, chewy noodles.  Each bite, the pasta picked up insane amounts of creamy, cajun sauce with a nice texture from the crawfish. \n\nFor appetizers, I had the hush puppies which were definitely a must order.  Crispy on the outside but again, salty inside but lots of cajun influence.  \n\nDefinitely try when in Tuscon!","2097":"Service was good! My server recommended the frog legs and I was hesitant to try. IM GLAD I DID! They were amazing ! I'll be back","2098":"The food was the worst food I have ever had, I hope I don't get sick. I can not get the nasty mold taste of the shrimp po boy out of my mouth. The server disappeared for a while and my food was somewhat cold, I could tell it was not brought out right when it was done being made. They were very busy tonight and we waited an hour , but with COVID not every table is being used- meaning it's technically not even a full house compared to last year pre COVID when full occupancy was permitted. I spent $70 on a meal for 3 kiwi and grapefruit lemonades which were very bitter and odd tasting, a disgusting mold tasting pasta, and 2 shrimp po boys that were also moldy tasting. The food tasted like dirty dish water that had been fermenting for a day or three. I wish I never came here, I came after wanting to come for a long time as I have heard about here from people. I have lived almost half my life in Louisiana, a half hour away from New Orleans, and have had authentic southern food- this is NOT IT. Do not go here. The restaurant has really beautiful artwork and I love how it looks on the inside, but the food is terrible. The taste is still in my mouth, after drinking old strawberry lemonade from my car. I can't wait to go hone and brush my teeth. It's now 10:00 and nothing is open but we are all still hungry. Also, they were sold out of 4 things we asked for.","2099":"We called ahead with reservations for two  and said we  would like a quiet corner.  We arrived only 6 minutes later than our 5:30 reservation because of police vehicles blocking our route (this is a lovely place, but keep in mind the surrounding area has some shady places that I won't drive through at night) and we had had to find another way there.\n\nThere were two women standing at the desk and the one was very smiley and welcoming, while the other did not smile or say welcome .  She seemed to be the host as she asked our name.  What she did say was something close to \"Well it's nice that you could make it\", in a snotty tone.  I said, pleasantly, \"Yes, sorry, and told her about the police cars, to which she did not reply in any way.  The pleasant woman took us to our seat.\n\nThis was not a nice weather night and the restaurant was not that busy.  \nWe were taken upstairs to a cushioned love seat type table.  However, there was a table of 6 adults and two young children right next to us.  Without complaining about every single obnoxious noise from that table, especially the children, but also from their parents (and the fact the children kept getting up, etc.), it was NOT the quiet corner we had hoped for.  When we mentioned this to the server she said she could try to find us another table but my husband, who has a bad back, really liked the cushioned seat.  We asked if there was another area with similar seating, but were told there wasn't.  So we opted to stay.  In hindsight, we should have gotten up and looked around ourselves.  Unfortunately, as the evening went on, the noise and distraction continued.  We kept hoping that they were leaving because they were there before is, but they stayed till the bitter end.  Well, we made a point of staying just a little longer just to enjoy the quiet, but by that time we were so rattled, it didn't matter. \n\n At one point I stepped outside to get away from the constant noise and the hostess asked how was everything.  I said that we weren't leaving but that I had to get outside to get away from the noisy children.  I also said how awesome the food was.  And, once again, her reply sounded snotty and she said \"well, at least you are enjoying the food\".  \nI understand that when there is a table of 8 versus a table of 2, the table of 8 is going to make the restaurant more money, and therefore catered to, but I felt so disappointed that for this very expensive restaurant our romantic evening was ruined.  We kept a good attitude and appreciated the food and pleasant surroundings, staff (except for the hostess) but it was really quite disappointing as we don't go to places this expensive on a regular basis.\n\nWhen we walked out we peaked around a little and saw a more private room with a curtain with several tables where these people could have been seated.  There were also various areas that were not filled up with people.\n\nI hate to complain, but I want the owner and manager to know that the hostess that evening, last Saturday, was not kind, welcoming, or professional.  Her irritated, snotty tone continued when I asked what the balance was on our gift card.  She sighed and started trying to figure it out but then handed it off to someone else with that same tone.  She seems to forget her presentation and mannerisms are noticed by others.  And it is her job to be professional, kind and welcoming to everyone.  I've worked in service industries.  We weren't unpleasant, but we did speak up that this was not a quiet corner. We were not going to lie and tell her everything was perfect just to get her to maybe be pleasant. She's a very immature person and doesn't belong in that classy place.\nEveryone else who we were in contact with was professional and pleasant.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  If we could be assured that I wouldn't have to have that kind of experience again we'd come back for the food, for sure.\nWe selected a pre priced meal that was offered.  Apparently there were a couple of up-charges that we were not told about so they were taken off the bill.  It should always be noted on the menu or relayed by the person taking your order if there is an additional charge for something.\n\nFrom bread to main course, we could not imagine the food being more delicious.  We didn't care for their desserts, but we tried them since they came with the dinners.  Nothing wrong with them, just not our personal taste in desserts.\nWe love kids and have grandkids.  Our own kids always behaved when we were out.  We would NOT have taken them to this kind of restaurant anyway because it doesn't seem right when most people come to a classy place expecting not to see children.  Parents should know better and do the right thing if their kids are disturbing others by leaving or asking for a private setting away from others who just want to enjoy a nice evening out.","2100":"This place is cool. We wanted breakfast\/ brunch and didn't realize they only serve it on Sundays, but we did lunch instead. They served up a good Bloody Mary, the decor is cool, funky New Orleans inspired, as is the food. I think the breakfast issue wa any bad, I didn't call to check first luckily mom and wife weren't mad at me. I liked the vertical pickle garnish and would have given five starts if there wa more than one vegetarian option on the menu, other than a salad  as my wife and I are both vegetarians. We shared the eggplant burger and fries and a salad which was fresh with a nice dressing and ordered the hush puppies for the table which could have used more dipping sauce but were quite good (my first time). Portion sizes were all quite decent, our server was nice and attentive and the food was simple but good. Fries could have been crispier, but overall a decent option. Wish I could have tried the Dutch baby and other brunch options, next time!","2101":"Looked at this place a few times and finally made it here. A really nice surprise for those of us who love Southern style food. My husband had the Quail dinner - fried cheesy grits and meal very flavorful. I ate the Gumbo sans additions (ie crawfish or shrimp) - flavorful and just the right amount of spice. The hush puppies taste like my MIL used to make. Will be sure to make it back next time we are in town. Thanx for the great food\nActually returned this week for another go. Great food. Ready to get my gumbo on!!","2102":"Average at best. I looked forward to trying this out. The menu is limited and the service was subpar. Drinks weren't very cold. Cornbread was great but that was all. Entrees not something I'll return for. Somewhat disappointed overall.","2103":"This was one of my favorite places in Tucson but when I went last week our server was rude and barely came to check on us. We were seated outside and the restaurant had one other couple inside. Every time I ordered a cocktail she was almost mad I ordered something and I asked twice for cheese on my burger and never got it. Just hope you don't get an older blonde lady serving you and you should have a great experience .","2104":"Blivens, whoever in your family perfected those greens deserves a medal. A statue. An aircraft carrier named after them. I salute you.\n\nThe cocktails were balancing acts of sour, sweet, boozy. That Georgia porch tea is dangerous - the peachy refreshment belies the vodka. My mule had enough of a boozy punch to put hair on your head, as it should be in a copper mug.\n\nWhoever decided to combine a beurre blanc with barbecue sauce got the best of both worlds: decadently rich but interestingly flavored. It would be weird to own barbecue sauce lotion, but if it weren't...\n\nThe grit cake was delicious but the texture didn't quite deliver on the inside or outside - the middle was all softness and creaminess without any tooth to the grits but the outside managed toasty, not crispy. Now, I devoured the thing with the shrimp on top of it and that sauce, but I left about half of it alone because it was a vehicle for the other things on the plate.\n\nI'm very glad I finally visited, Parish. I'll be seeing y'all.","2105":"If you want something subtle and refined, this is not the place. If you want to shoot up your cholesterol by 200% for no particular reason, this is the place.","2106":"This is a great and unique place to grab some quality food with good portions. They have some go-tos like burgers and sandwiches but also offer some unique choices like oyster Po-boys. We've consistently had great food and service and come on the reg.","2107":"Not  impressed, I got a garden salad  with shrimp  and it literally  came with 4 shrimp. \n\nThe  service  is poor and they never checked  on us. I wish there were more servers  than 1.\n\nI will not come  back.","2108":"One of the most beautiful grounds covered with unique sculptures, make this place a must visit. Nestled on the waterbed, Rat's Restaurant is a French themed restaurant offering seasonal items, thus their menu is not fixed. One should definitely call ahead for restaurant availability as it hosts many events which closes the restaurant down for walk-in patrons. \n\nI have to start with service, it was one of the best service offered by our host, William who not only knew the menu inside out but had a story for the history of the location to everything that could be associated with the dining experience. \n\nThe menu had a plenty of options to choose from, from which we selected the traditional onion soup, Marseille Style Shrimp Stew, Bronzino, Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon and for drinks the non-alcoholic watermelon cooler and strawberry lemonade. \n\nBefore the food came out, their 2 variety of breads were incredibly amazing accompanied by a her buttery spread. The soup was average and the shrimp stew was flavorful. The Bronzino stood out as the most flavorful fish I'd had in a long time which was perfectly paired with cous cousins, pine nuts  and pickled currants. The salmon was flaky and the bois bourdran gave it a crispy topping which was nicely paired with herb smashed potatoes.  \n\nFor dessert, we tried the coconut rice pudding with passion fruit sorbet and the raspberry rhubarb accompanied by buttermilk ice cream. Both were amazing...! \n\nLoved this place, the vibes and William our server.","2109":"Highly. Highly. Highly. Recommend!! We did take out\/curbside service so unfortunately I can't comment on the inside but let me tell you--the food is hands down DEVINE. I love me some red beans and rice and this by far exceeded my expectations. My wife & I were doing a staycation & wanted a menu that had a little of everything we wanted so our meal consisted of: bacon popcorn, red beans and rice, cornbread, shrimp & grits (came with collards), pulled pork sandwich, edamame, & bread pudding so as you can see we FEASTED and enjoyed every last morsel. It was easy to order online and the food was ready right on time. A friendly text to let us know our order was ready and we were on our way--parking for curbside was right out front and they brought it to our car within a minute or two. All neatly packaged, condiments we asked for were included as well as utensils. \n\nEvery thing we ate was seasoned so well, perfect portions and it knocked my socks off. BACON. POPCORN. need I say more?!! I can't believe we haven't been here before but now that we know what deliciousness awaits we will definitely be coming back.","2110":"We truly love this restaurant.  Of course, the food is outstanding, or we never would have returned.  In fact, we don't return often enough. The service is also attentive and polite, but without being overbearing.","2111":"My favorite St Patrick's place and as being part Irish,  they put on the best St Patrick's gigs and bag pipes performance. A reminder of Ireland and the great pubs!  This acquaint place have bands just like New Orleans. We need more places like this. Great atmosphere, fun people. Food is just ok. Daily specials. But the place just makes up for the so-so food. It's like cheers everyone knows you. Cheers! I have a great time every time I go!","2112":"Both the venue and the staff were absolutely amazing. Special mention goes out to Billy and Mike. They made our trip go from awesome to perfect. They truly went above and beyond for us.","2113":"My favorite restaurant in all of Tucson I have never been disappointed and the prices are reasonable. They accommodated me for my birthday with separate checks and the service was great!","2114":"What you see is not what you get!  They changed menu for the worse.  No catfish at diner time. Burgers are not that big.  Seems portions have gotten smaller. Beeen there about 5 months ago and was great, don't think  I will go back for awhile. Good place gone south....","2115":"Wasn't bad but wasn't great\n\nThe drunken noodles tasted good and it makes you go in for another bite but after a few it got to be too much of a rich flavor. Maybe if they had a few start of asparagus or something for contrast to the richness would have been good. \n\nThe gumbo was the least favorite, it had a smokey flavor and honestly wasn't good.\n\nThe quail was all around had the same texture and needed a little contrast.\n\nThe peaches cocktail was amazing tho!","2116":"I came here for NYE and had drinks in the bar area. They had their late night HH menu which was great as well as live music. Everyone danced til a little after midnight. They also gave complimentary champagne and NYE gear and we watched the ball drop on their tv while doing a countdown to midnight.","2117":"I'm visiting family in Tucson and have never been in the area before this trip. Took a look at Yelp to find unique dining experiences and this restaurant came up. We decided to give it a try and are SO happy we did!\n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the decor was amazing and reminded us of Bourbon Street immediately. Vibrant colors and amazing artwork filled the place.\n\nWe chose our seats and were instantly greeted by an OUTSTANDING waiter named David. We were one of about 12 tables that David was waiting almost completely by himself. Never once did it feel that way. David was attentive, charming, and on. top. of. everything!\n\nNext, the food. Out of all the restaurants I've eaten at on my trip, this restaurant served the best food by far. We started off with the crawfish hushpuppies which were crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked and moist on the inside. The sweet and sour sauce that came with it paired beautifully. We ordered the shrimp poboy and fish & chips as our entrees. To my surprise, the fish and chips was a giant slab of fish, but after cutting into it I was not upset about the size at all. It was the perfect crispy batter to choice-cut fish ratio. The shrimp poboy was reminiscent of what you can find in NOLA. The shrimp was moist, not over-cooked, and encased in a crispy cornmeal batter.\n\nWe ended our dining experience with a warm, fresh bread pudding which felt like it was made-to-order. If we hadn't completely devoured our appetizer and entrees we may have been able to finish the rich dessert we ordered.\n\nI couldn't have spent my last day of my trip eating at a better restaurant. Amazing, that's all I can say.","2118":"We were in search of a Mardi Gras themed location while visiting family. It is adorably decorated and I could easily picture myself amongst the decor. The food was pretty tasty but a bit spicier than I remember jambalaya being! Even the seasonings in the burger leaned to the dark side of spice. The youngest refused the rest of her food because of it. Service was great! My glass was never empty and neither were the rest of my party of eight. The construction makes it a bit awkward and sketchy looking at first but go in anyway!","2119":"We are in town for the weekend and found this place on Yelp.  The food was great as well as the service.  The sweet tea was actually sweet.  If you're looking for good Cajun\/Creole food this is the location.  Had a chance to meet the chief to tell him how much we enjoyed the meal.  Check them out you will not be disappointed.","2120":"One Star and thats generous. We went there late about 945 and right way they hit us the late nite menu. Even though we called and the man who answered the phone said full menu till 10.  My husband had been here before for lunch and said the food was decent for the price. We sat ourselves outsideon the patio which was empty along with all the other seats in the restaurant except for the bar. It took about 10 mins for someone to acknowlegde us. We ordered our drinks which then too another 10 mins which we still don't understand why. We go to order off the very small late nite menu and our first choice is'nt even available ( Chicken wings). We ordered the frog legs , hushpuppies, and fries with the white truffle aioli. The food took a reasonable amount of time but the quality was not good. The hushpuppies were very dry and overcooked so overcoooked they were almost black. They were served with a sauce that tasted like overly sweet pancake syrup and onions. We both could NOT even finish one. The frog legs my husband enjoyed, I tried one not really my thing but he enjoyed them, the sauce served with the frog legs tasted like thousand island dressing we only tried that once. The fries were just ok the white truffle aioli was tasteless. We were so disappointed because not only were we expecting to be able to order off the full menu but the food was just not good at all. We will not be return because of the bad service and the bad food. We also will not be recommending this place to any of our friends and family. You really did leave a bad taste in our mouths and our wallets.","2121":"Cool place. The BBQ shrimp and grit bowl was delicious! My husband really enjoyed the Mother Trucker. The coffee was delicious, too. Definitely recommend this place.","2122":"My wife and I recently had lunch at Rat's after a thoroughly enjoyable fall color walking tour. The restaurant was not crowded and wait staff was plentiful but our wait time of 35 minutes for our lunch was unacceptable. Our waiter, Nicholas, was attentive and very apologetic regarding the long wait for our food. He apologized to other tables as well.\n\nI had the Chicken Salad (large chunks of white meat chicken over lettuce with croutons and a light dressing) and it was excellent. Carol chose the Frittata and it was bland - looked like it came out of an automat, if anyone remembers automats. It just didn't meet the standard for Rat's. We shared an order of Pommes Frites and they were excellent.\n\nAll in all a disappointing experience and I hope Rat's is monitoring customer reviews.","2123":"Parish does Cajun right! We were so happy to find a place that feels in New orleans in TUCSON! What a treat!","2124":"Huge portions and great taste! First time going here and was highly pleased. Will come back with more people because of the big portions.","2125":"Excellent meal and service!  Will def come here again. I had the Dutch baby and hubby had chicken and waffles. Both were outstanding. Their hot sauce is to die for!  Can't wait to try other things\n\nSecond trip: gumbo and drunken angel. Fabulous!!","2126":"I've read the reviews and have to scratch my head a bit. I had the sazerac, which was fine and the soft shell crab over chorizo and green tomato. To start about the dish, the sunny side egg that topped the dish was a little over cooked as to have very little yolk liquidity, which this dish desperately needs, the fried green tomato was battered far to thickly with cornmeal, very dry, and the tomato had no juice. The muffins underneath weren't cooked or barely touched the grill, no evidence of that. The chorizo was ok, and the crab was ok at best, but sad that it gave its life for this dish. I will sum this dish up as dry, dry, ehh. Half of my family was born and raised in the French quarter, and geaux Saints!","2127":"This was my first experience at an expensive restaurant, so I really have nothing similar to compare it to, but it doesn't matter. It went beyond my expectations. I decided to book reservations for a party of 5 for my birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. After reading some reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about the service, but in actuality the service was phenomenal; everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Our server came around constantly to ask how everything was, and other staff members came around to clear away our used dishes throughout the meal. \n\nI should also mention that the ambiance is inspired by the French countryside but a bit more playful. It's very cozy, making it perfect for an intimate dinner with that special someone (wink wink). I imagine that this place is quite beautiful during lunchtime, as you'll get to see all the colors more easily. But if you choose to go there for dinner, you'll be just as pleased.  \n\nThey gave us complimentary bread with olive oil and sea salt, followed by our appetizers, then complimentary popovers with shallot herb butter (yum!) before our main dishes.  Everything was delicious but I highly highly HIGHLY recommend the petite escargots appetizer. The escargots were soft, silky, and buttery. And the pumpkin ravioli that they served them with was simple but quite delicious, especially with that smooth sauce drizzled on top. Also, I'm a bit regretful that I didn't order any cocktails, but they had a list of fall-inspired cocktails that sounded absolutely delicious. \n\nOf course this restaurant is expensive, but it's worth it for a special occasion. You won't be disappointed!","2128":"Dmmmmo zmmrt S.\nr.fVbnkf\nmffffff\nMlmmf\nLl.pcccMlmmmedC\nXxxC. Clcimmm ffld.FRr:'(*\\0\/*\n\n\nSo, I somehow reviewed the Parish from my pocket. Whoops. \n\nThey still get 5 starts, though. Great menu, service, knowledgeable staff, beer menu, and cocktails.","2129":"Not bad, but it did not live up to the hype.\n\nFirst, the reservation: made for 4, 2 adults, 2 toddlers--highchairs requested. When we arrived, we were brought to the table, asked for highchairs, and were awkwardly waiting with 2 toddlers & strollers while the staff decided to get the highchairs.  Mind you that my friend was full-term while I also had my newborn strapped to me--we wanted to sit, not fuss for a few more minutes.  My stroller was put in the back immediately, they forgot about the second stroller for 30 minutes--it was simply sitting in the dining area (we had forgotten about it, having assumed it was put away).\n\nSecondly, both of us hadn't yet made it to Rats. Our husbands were jealous that we were going without them.  It had taken me over a year to get a pass from the library to the grounds, and we had each been told by everyone that this was the most amazing restaurant EVER.  It wasn't.  Good, but not orgasmic.  \n\nSo it wasn't all that, but I do plan to return in the springtime, or another 60F day (if that's in January or February, so be it).\n\nIt took us 2 tries to find the entrance--having just spent 90 minutes walking through a sculpture garden, it can be hard to tell what is actually functional (it's the gypsy trailer).  Warm and fun with an old traveller's inn feel.\n\nThe table was cute, bright, & in the corner.  I'm happy to report that they serve real food to children--not just nug nugs and frozen pizza.  E's cheeseburger & C's salmon (both adult sized, as in 3x larger than an adult should eat), were amazing.  The salmon was tender & fresh, and it looked like they knew how to make a well-done burger juicy, which is quite a feat.  We both opted for salads for our daughters; as much as I love onions, their dressing was a bit too oniony even for me.\n\nCharcuterie: disappointing. Good flavour, but 2 wafer thin slices each of 2 salamis, then a wafer-thin slice of an odd mortadella that had too much clove (I'm used to mortadella tasting like bologna, this was rather pale but ok).  The house pate was too hard, and the tapenade tasted like mustard (it was oddly fine; I'm used to it being less like a smooth mustard and more like a paste).  If you've had the charcuterie plate at Teresa's Caffe, which is a meal on itself, this is about 1\/3 that size.\n\nBread: fantastic baguettes, served with a compound butter which could have been smoother, but maybe it was simply too cold?  My daughter and friend loved the butter, and bread\n\nMoules frites: decent.  Not super plump, as I had last week at Witherspoon Grill, but okay.  The broth needed a bit more seasoning, and the chorizo should have been diced, not served in half-moon wedges 1\/2\" thick; at that thickness, they take on a vile texture.\n\nFries were good, and the potato salad, I was told, was amazing. Turkey sandwich was good.\n\nFor dessert, my daughter preferred the chevre-cinnamon ice cream to the pecan pumpkin (good girl!  she's only 2); my friend liked the nutella ice cream.\n\nWe had to flag the waiter down, as he didn't notice that our daughters had decided it was time to go.\n\nThen I had to let the waiter know that the milk and apple juice were included with the kids' meals; he tried disputing that, until I pointed it out in black and white on the menu in front of my daughter.\n\nI didn't love our waiter.  He seemed a bit off.  The next station over had a friendlier waiter.  The busser (or waiter not yet with tables?) was very friendly too. \n\nHonestly, I love Julia Child and French food, but it's disappointing when you really have to peruse a menu for things made without butter or cream, then have a chef or kitchen staff that is OMG clueless when they can't simply add butter or cream.  It simply seems like such a basic skill these days for cooks to know how to be the least bit inventive, yet that's so far from the truth.  It's less shocking that everything at Cheesecake Factory is pre-made with butter & cream, more shocking that either the waiter or the kitchen staff at Rat's had zero interest in helping me choose something that wouldn't make me break out in hives.\n\nLeftovers to take home are wrapped in foil shaped like a rat.  Clever and cute!  Reminds me of the 70s, when French places made swans to carry leftovers home.\n\nOur bill totaled $100 for 2 adults and 2 toddlers, for lunch, before tip, including 2 glasses of prosecco.\n\nI seemed to have a bad texture day at Rat's.  The butter wasn't smooth enough to spread on my daughter's bread.  The house pate reminded me of head cheese while the mortadella was kind of flabby or flappy--not appealing, but I was starving.  On the flip side, the salmon really was incredible, and if Rats is open in 10 years, I'm treating Charlotte and a group of 12 year olds to lunch here.  It's adorable inside and out.  But my food wasn't all that.","2130":"Great menu. Good food.  Good drinks.  Great service. Pretty cool ambiance. Nice place to hang with friends.","2131":"One of the most beautiful group of servers I've seen in a while, and I get around. If you can stop staring long enough to look at the menu, I'm pretty happy with what I ordered too. The drunken angel was delicious. Happy hour IPA for $3? Yes, thank you. Finished off with a hot toddy perfectly constructed? Abso-freakin'-lutely. If you think you missed the boat traveling east to west along I-10, think again. As a New Yorker, this is the place to go and I hope to make it back.","2132":"Food was amazing here as well as the service!\n\nBeen wanting to come here ever since I saw one of my Yelp friends post about it on here. Me and my boyfriend came here for an early lunch before we were headed to the grounds for Sculpture. \n\nThe exterior of the building is huge and has so many different sculptures to look at while walking in. It was a bit difficult finding the main door, but when we did, we opened these large doors that looked like they were from another time. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is warm and intimate and has a lot of nice paintings. \n\nWhen it came to the service, it was impeccable. We started off with a bread service that had a few different types of bread, then we ended up ordering some drinks.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the french onion soup, which was popular there, I ordered the turkey blt on a croissant with a side salad. The food was so fresh and tasted so good. \n\nI cant wait to come back here again some time soon.","2133":"Hit this place on a night when Eric Schaffer and The Other Troublemakers are playing. Great sound! Great food, great service","2134":"We decided to try something new for a Sunday brunch. Our waiter was attentive and able to give us some recommendations like the popular Drunken Angel and the Shrimp and Grits. We decided to try the pulled pork sandwich and the Grits accompanied by a Caphirina.\nThe pulled pork came with a side of Gumbo which was spicy but delicious, the sandwich was a little on the dry side but had great flavors. The Shrimp had a little bit of a bitter oil flavor (possibly from Florida) but the fried Grits where delicious.","2135":"They have great food and drinks. I have enjoyed every meal there. It's a nice change from your typical Tucson restaurant.","2136":"Absolutely loved it. It's so hard to find great Cajun food in Tucson and this is it. My red beans and rice were spicy but so flavorful. The hush puppies were so light and peppery, there were definitely not enough of them.\nCan't wait to come back!","2137":"The atmosphere is gorgeous.  The restaurant is built on a artists' retreat owned by one of the J&J grandsons.  The restaurant is breathtaking.  Beautiful grounds, fantastic dining room, super cool bar, and a spectacular wine list.  The only thing this restaurant is missing is good food. The food is NEVER consistent here.  Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bland.  The prices are also way overpriced.  If the food was better I would absolutely pay those prices.  Ask for a private showing of the Vincent Van Gogh blue room....it's a life size room built to resemble the famous painting. Pretty cool.  The entire grounds are pretty amazing too....get there an hour early and walk the grounds. The sculptures will amaze you.","2138":"We were looking for something unique, and definitely found it! To find Southern food in the desert is not a frequent occurrence, or is finding frog legs on a menu. We enjoyed the atmosphere, music and the food. I had the frog legs, and enjoyed them, although the bacon wrap did obscure the taste of the frog legs somewhat. Be aware the horseradish in the accompanying dipping sauce is hot. There is a modest, but interesting wine selection, and we and a great AZ wine. We will be back next time we are in Tucson.","2139":"We really wanted to like this place and tried it three times and have concluded the food is mediocre and overpriced.  For example, I ordered an oyster po'boy and it was basically all bread and few oysters.  I had to open the roll to even prove to myself there were actual oysters inside.  I found three breaded oysters inside bread.  But what really convinced us not to return was their failure to honor a gift card sent to us by our son.  When it came time to pay the waitress we offered her the gift card, which was not a run of the mill card but a special arrangement of our son, (so it had none of those frustrating limitations you will often find on a store bought card) and we included in our payment a 20% tip.  The manager of the Parish would not allow us to use the cash paid card to pay the tip.  Our son sent cash to the Parish and we expected it to be treated as cash. Mediocre food, overpriced, and greedy management.  Wow, what's not to like?","2140":"What an experience. I can't believe this Disney world for adults. I didn't have the stamina to explore the sculptures much but I will be sure to bring others here to experience the park and one of the 4 restaurants on property. We were greeted with signature cocktails and told to explore for a bit. We then dined in the upstairs private room. There are stairs as well as an elevator which is what I used. There are bathrooms on both floors but not many stalls for the amount of people who dine here at once. So there was a line for ladies room. The amuse bouche was a crab and corn gazpacho which was outstanding and I easily could have eaten an appetizer portion of it. I definitely wanted more. Just wish it had a bit of cilantro because would put it over the top. I went with the boring choice of bean salad which was interesting. I tasted someone's tuna tartar which I was jealous I hadn't order it. It was so fresh and unlike many flavors I've ever had. The house made raisin bread and popovers were warm fresh and delicious. I ordered the Seabass aa my entree and after one bite I had an allergic reaction to the fish. I had no idea I was allergic to seabass only tilapia(garbage fish). I calmly called my waiter to please take it. The server and owners were so truly concerned and cared about my well being. Once I told them it wasn't a terrible reaction just itchy scratchy mouth where my tongue swells for a few minutes. They insisted on bringing me a different entree and they didn't have to twist my arm. I didn't want to be adventurous and went with the safe choice the short rib and holly moly this was the best short rib I ever had it fell apart it was so tender, no knife needed. They packed up half of it in an adorable foil shaped rat. It heated up perfectly the next day. \nMy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was fine just what you expect, aka they didn't reinvent the wheel but an easy favorite for lovers of creme brulee. I tasted the chocolate tort with balsamic, very very rich but such depth of flavored. I could not eat more then a bite but it would be the perfect one bite dessert to close this lovely meal. It should maybe ordered by 3 or 4 people as your final taste of the night.\nWe ended with a tour of the kitchen and were treated to one lady delicious bit of fresh mint Madeline's. All I can say is yum yum yum. Very worth the 75 minute drive to and from Staten Island.","2141":"Great little restaurant located in the middle of the Grounds for Sculpture. Make sure to request a seat outside, especially if there is nice weather! Situation right on a pond the outdoor patio also overlooks some beautiful works of art from GFS. It seriously feel like you are in the middle of a painting, unreal!\nWe came here for lunch while exploring the art installations. They have some nice salad options like a baby gem salad, a chopped salad or a seafood salad. There are also burgers and sandwiches like a Reuben, ham or shrimp. If you are looking for something more hearty they have entrees that include mussels, trout, steak, quiche or chicken.\nWe went with the burgers and the Reuben sandwich. The portions were very large and filling! My cousin said the Reuben was one of the best Reuben sandwiches she ever had before! It came with house-made pastrami, gruyere cheese, alsatian sauerkraut on a nice white russian bread and served with fries. The sauerkraut had so much flavor and paired perfectly with the gruyere cheese and pastrami. Our burgers came with sharp cheddar, an amazing secret sauce and topped with lettuce. Juicy and full of flavor. \nThe price tags are a little hefty. $17 & $18 but for the convenience and flavor, I think it was well worth it!\nThey also have an interesting drink menu! We enjoyed some summer mixed drinks that really packed a punch! I really enjoyed having the Watermelon Sangria! Rose Wine with Watermelon and Melon Liquer , great for a warm day out! My cousin went with the Blood Orange which is a Spiced Rum with Cointreau splash of lime some Blood Orange and Agave. She said it was just the right amount of sweet and nice with the spiced rum. My Aunt went harder with the Pina y Paloma which has Tattoo Tequila, Pineapple Syrup and Grapefruit Soda. She said it was stroooong!!\nWe also had to splurge and have desserts! Make sure to get the donuts and dipping sauces! THEY ARE AMAZING! The sauces are even better and it's great for sharing or being greedy and enjoying all by yourself!\nService was pleasant and prompt.","2142":"Food was outstanding and the beer selection was quality. Service and ambience were excellent.","2143":"Our family and friends met last night at the Parish and everything was awesome. We had a large group (12- and we did have a reservation), but despite that service was fast, pleasant, and the food was sooooo good. Thank you Parish and staff for such a great experience and amazing meal!","2144":"Rats should be an wonderful experience, the design of the restaurant and grounds is individual and classy, the food is great but the service is so poor.  We booked nearly a month before for our daughters birthday, when we arrived we were made to feel unwelcome because we arrived 7 minutes before our reservation.  No one offered to take our coats, show us to the bar to wait, etc.  5 mins later they said an inside table would be another 20 to 30 minutes but we could sit outside.  They said there were heaters (it was 55f outside) but the table they sat us at the heaters were not working.  Then the waiter was disinterested in describing the menu or providing any level of extra service beyond the bare minimum.\n\nIf we had not booked, or gone to a cheaper restaurant this may have all been fine, but this was meant to be a magical night but it turned out to be a total let down.","2145":"Use to love this place. Went with friends on 5\/18\/19 and the food and service was horrible. The special was 3 scallops on rice for $32.00. Ridiculous!! The scallops were gritty and over cooked. The appetizers we ordered arrived 10 minutes after we finished dinner. The Parrish has turned into a hang out for purple haired tattooed urban hipsters and their douchbag neck beard Beta male boyfriends. We try to support local businesses but McDonalds is a better choice then the Parish now. Will never return again.","2146":"My favorite restaurant in Tucson. I take all my guests here. The shrimp and grits are phenomenal.","2147":"One of the best meals I have ever eaten. My wife and I tried The Parish for our anniversary. I ordered the shrimp and grits on the recommendation of our server Skyler and my wife ordered a burger. The burger was perfectly cooked and even the bleu cheese was in the right proportion to keep the burger balanced. The food was amazing, the staff was knowledgeable and responsive. It was a Tuesday night and there was live music. The atmosphere was so much fun. Seriously, try the shrimp and grits.","2148":"Went with friends and had a great dinner. The hushpuppies are really good, which makes for a terrific start. The singer of the evening was really decent, sounded a bit like Cat Stevens. Then there was the serious food. We shared the blueberry tea smoked chicken and the compressed watermelon salad. Both were really, really good. The sauce with the chicken was incredible. Two of our friends had the gumbo and immediately said they would be returning. The third had french fries, a huge bowl, which she shared and which were good and then the salmon which she loved. She also had a glass of red wine which reached her standards, and she spends a lot of time in France. \n\nThe place was crowded so the expediting was a little off, but the service was good and the patrons all looked as happy as we felt. I did suggest they introduce some duck on their menu. Duck with that blueberry tea sauce might put this place in Michelin land.","2149":"Staggeringly expensive. They definitely want you to pay for the uniqueness of their inventory. \n\nI like the Nevada\/Reno theme, the focus on local, and not everything is 'made in china' with Nevada plastered on it. \n\nCute store to visit, but waaaay overpriced. I like supporting local like this, but I won't be back.","2150":"Over all, place just sucks. We went there for the fish and chips. They ruined it. The fish did not taste right and the slaw was gross. Will never head back again.","2151":"Came here with my husband for a late lunch after walking around the Grounds for Sculpture. They serve lunch until 3pm and we walked in around 2:45pm. We were only able to sit at the bar because they were starting to set up the tables for dinner.  This wasn't a problem at all. The bar sits maybe ten people and there is a fireplace in the room.  The whole place has a Moroccan feel to it. In front of the fireplace they had an area with pillows where you could lounge on the floor.  If you're coming from the Grounds for Sculpture you need to walk all the way through the restaurant to the front to get to the hostess. \n\nThe bartender was very friendly and never at any point rushed us. They have a large selection of Bloody Mary's. The bartender let us try out their Bloody Mary mix but we just aren't Bloody Mary people.  We did have other drinks and he did not skimp on the alcohol. \n\nThe lunch menu is small and but there are plenty of options. I chose the Fuji apple salad with chicken and my husband had the short ribs with frites. Both were excellent. Prices were around $12-$18. \n\nI'm sure this place is even nicer in the warmer weather when everything is in bloom and you can sit outside. \n\nDon't miss the sculptures behind the restaurant!  'Employee Shower' is tucked behind to the left and there are a couple more along the water. \n\nOverall a really nice place if you're in the area but it is pretty pricey.","2152":"We came for brunch buffet which they charged $62\/pp. The dishes offered were mediocre and terrible service. For the food available on the buffet table, I would say $35-40 is fair but $62? I don't think so\nAlso, the server was curt and unattentive. My friend was ready for dessert when she could not find someone to ask so she got up and ready to get a spoon herself. Out of nowhere, she was accosted by one of the servers saying she cannot do that. My friend had to defend herself saying no one was around to help her.\nI love the grounds especially in the summer but for the holiday brunch? and the 1 1\/2 hours drive? Its just not worth it. I would say skip it!","2153":"The food is overpriced and incredibly underwhelming. I was definitely much happier with the fast food I had for breakfast. We came for lunch and the ambiance is definitely unbeatable so that's the reason for the stars but that was essentially the only positive. The cheese board was shockingly overpriced and poorly presented. It was like they threw a handful of off brand nuts on a plate with three pieces of cheese as an afterthought. I've never seen such a poorly done charcuterie and I belong to an Aldis Facebook group so that's saying a lot. Our main courses were simply ok. The bloody Mary's are absolutely terrible, the worst I've ever had. There is no chance we will going back to this place, I can't stomach the thought of wasting $150 on terrible food on purpose. It's too bad because given the atmosphere, it has the potential to be a really great spot but as it stands, a high school home ec class could put together a better meal. I really hope they read their reviews bit given the number that are similar to mine, it seems very unlikely.","2154":"Second time having lunch at Rat's and in the Fall is a great time to sit outside by the pond and enjoy good food. Unlike other Yelper's we've always had good service and even though my reservation via OpenTable was lost they took care of us promptly and gave us a large table outside even though there was only 2 of us. The food has always been good, is it on a par with Veau d'or in NYC?, No, but its as good as most French places we've tried in the area.","2155":"Great food, excellent service under a beautiful atmosphere, celebrate my birthday last week, I heard about this place from some friends  it theirs comments were short to the reality, had a very nice bottle of wine, start with the pork belly well done for my entree the short ribs","2156":"Looking for a great place to eat, well I won't look any further past the Parish because this place has it . This amazing southern style food restaurant offers the greatest experience anyone can get in Tucson.","2157":"Truly a great plqce. The cocktails are excellent. They frequently have live entertainment. The ambiance is friendly and mellow but the food is top notch!!  I love the bacon popcorn!  Favorite dish: drunken angel pasta. If you haven't tried it here yet, you should.","2158":"Before dinner, I had the opportunity and pleasure to explore the beautiful grounds. Apparently the Grounds for Sculpture are 42 acres!\n\nCome dinner time, I ordered the Tuna Tartare, the Roasted Short Rib, and the Torta Barozzi. The vegetables that came with each entree were out of this world! I tried the green beans with a saffron and chili paste sauce and the broccoli with a red wine, peppercorn, and horseradish sauce. I don't think I've ever tasted such delicious vegetables! Who can truly brag about veggies?! \n\nThe portions that were served were perfect. This gave you the chance to really enjoy your food and drinks without over eating, looking forward to the next dish that's on its way. \n\nAfter the gluttonous meal, we received a short tour of the kitchen. The chefs were so knowledgeable and personable. I cannot wait to come back here!","2159":"Thank you for taking proper safety cautions! We ordered in through door dash and with our order we ordered  a drink along with a meal and we received a mason jar that was TAPED to seal. Thank you for this. Genuinely appreciate this business and 10\/10 recommend coming here for a meal","2160":"You definitely need dinner reservations. They have it down to a science so you don't have to wait too long for your table. We have had celebrations there or just a cozy dinner. The food is always excellent! They mix up some pretty mean and different cocktails too. The staff is friendly and attentive. This is my favorite restaurant in Tucson!","2161":"This place was incredible. I had the Alabama Quail Pan seared then oven roasted, stuffed with shrimp, andouille and mushroom cornbread stuffing; served with corn maque choux, white cheddar grit cake and topped with Carolina gold sauce. Absolutely mind blowing. The ambience and food far surpassed anything I would expect to find in a shopping strip. I live in California and am saddened that I will not be back soon. Next time I am in Tucson I will be eating at the Parish.","2162":"Everything on the menu is done to perfection.  The staff is fantastic and and seasonal specials are always something special.  I do miss the Alabama quail after the menu change, but hoping to see it as a special.","2163":"We previously went here for open dining and it was excellent.  \nDon't go to one of there special events.  We went to the seafood bake.  It was a buffet set up.  We had to wait in a very long line to get the food and steamed clams were nearly gone when I finally reached them. Very disorganized in the way this was put together.  Almost seemed as if they never did a buffet before. Food was not at good temperatures and disappointing.  You get to pay a hefty sum for this package.  \n\nIf I go back it would be for waiter served only.  They do well with that.","2164":"I loved this place! The food was excellent and the set up is beautiful. The internet is a great tool to ensure you are paying prices you are comfortable with. Those who have a cow about the price shock must learn to seek foreknowledge.","2165":"I had a lot of expectations based on all the photos and reviews that I saw and read. The decor was nice, but the quality of food wasn't anything impressive (we tried their pork rinds, corn bread, and grilled trout). Also the bartenders were too busy to take away our empty dishes and left them all until we asked for our bill. Definitely not worth waiting for more than 15 mins. Better go to the Union a block away...","2166":"We had the late night specials: fries, edamame, hush puppies and the the moon burger. Drinks : vodka splash of cranberry and a margarita made with cucumber infused tequila. Everything was delicious!  Live band was a bonus! Definitely would return. On first glance you may have doubts but this place was amazing!\n\n\n2nd time dining here and we got to order from the REAL menu! Dinner was amazing! We had New York Strip with frites. The sauce on the frites was delicious as a stand alone. We also had  black and blue brussel sprouts and the DRUNKEN pasta with hush puppies! Everything was a winner! Totally think the chef, Travis could go against Bobby Flay!","2167":"So disappointed... ordered Gumbo with shrimp... all rice and gravy.. 3 shrimp and no sausage. What a Bummer~!@#$ What happened? Called, put on hold then nothing.. ?????","2168":"I would give this place 5 stars for The Dirty alone (infused pickle vodka, brined pickle garnish & olive juice) but oh, then they just HAVE to go and outdo themselves with great service, bacon popcorn, empanadas (pimpanadas), bacon wrapped frog legs... and this was all before we even got to the main course!\n\nMy parents were in town this weekend, and the boyfriend & I wanted to impress them with some of Tucson's best eats, so we thought The Parish could do the trick, and it did! So with that said, back to the important stuff, THE FOOD.  I had the Big Hippie (roasted eggplant sandwich with pomegranate ketchup...can this place read my tastebuds' mind?!)  Erik had the Drunken Angel (angel hair pasta, lobster broth, shrimp, crawfish, red pepper cream sauce... you get the picture goodness on goodness on goodness).  My parents opted for the Gumbo and the Shrimp & Grits... I mean, can't go wrong with that!  We all left with smiling bellies.\n\nMy ONLY complaint about this place is that their tables are WAY too small (yes, I know, it seems as though we got an excessive amount of food... but even with a \"normal\" amount they would still be lacking.) But alas, Parish, your tiny tables won't keep me away for long!","2169":"Amazing!! My husband is from Louisiana and he knows Louisiana Creole\/Cajun Food. Started with the hush puppies which were so crunchy and authentic. Loved the tarter sauce. I had the Drunken Angel pasta with shrimp & crawfish. Loved the French grilled baguette for dipping in the sauce. My husband had fried catfish and kids red beans & rice with sausage. Finished with bread pudding. Wish this place was in Los Angeles! We'll miss you Parish when we go home to LA.","2170":"Bacon popcorn - A+++\nPretzel -- A+++\nYou call it cocktail - A++\nHaitian pulled pork - A++\nBread pudding - A+ (could've used more sauce)\n\nAll together, it was a great experience.  This quaint location was really amazing and fun!  We had the best service and the food was amazing!  We went with a group of 7 and we never were in need of anything and the food was more than amazing.  My favorite had to be the bacon popcorn, which we ordered two because it was so delicious.  I also liked the fact that the bread pudding was topped with a chocolate dipped bacon.  \n\nWe left just as the live music was kicking off, but the experience was a great one!  I def recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there and can't wait to go back!!!","2171":"This was our second visit to Rats but the first for dinner.   The atmosphere is great as is the service. The food is so-so - nothing really wrong with it but just nothing special, particularly for the price.  If we had stuck to appetizers and bread we probably would have been satisfied.\n\nIf you've never been to the Grounds for Sculpture you should put it in your plans because it's a fun day.  If you're there for that then eating at Rats is a relaxing way to finish the day.","2172":"Was there for happy hour.  While the location was fantastic, the happy hour was at best, uninspired.","2173":"Soooo bomb. First time visiting Tuscon area & found this place on Yelp and decided to try it on a Sunday afternoon. The decor is so cute and colorful, bar area is really nice reminds me of a speakeasy. \nMusic was great & bathrooms were so clean! (A MUST FOR ME) there was also a baby changing station in there.\n\nThe food was so good we will def be back to try other options, we left full of comfort (: \nWe started off with the black and blue Brussels just because we love Brussels and have never tried them with a jam sauce. MUST TRY they were so warm and so yummy! \nMy man got the \"Carolina Pulled Pork Pibil\" - he killed it all. Let's just say that, & for me I ordered the shrimp & grits! It came with a side of collard greens (FIRE) so good & a creole BBQ sauce blanketed around my breaded grits topped with the shrimp. Cannot wait to come back.  \nFor drinks we were given water & I ordered a jalape\u00f1o margarita (so refreshing) & my mans ordered a dogfish beer. Staff was really attentive and very nice! They also accept reservations.","2174":"Great spot for a great evening bite to eat. I often get into town late and the parish is there to accommodate. Huge variety of eclectic tastes and flavors. Some will suppose you. Great beer selection as well. Definitely worth the trip","2175":"We went to Rat's for Thanksgiving dinner. It was served in the kitchen- which in some places is charming- here, it's not. It is dirty and messy. The kitchen staff was walking around eating. They were not at all attentive- the food stations didn't have servers. Food is stuck all over the serving pieces that had clearly not been replaced since early in the day. Many of the serving containers were almost empty- my husband had a few turkey bones. \nIt's a long unclean and unpleasant walk from the dining room to the kitchen. \nThe dining room has not been updated in a long time, if ever. The draperies and banquets are tired.\nRats might be ok for lunch or drinks on the terrace- but not a good Thanksgiving experience.\nThe management is at fault- the staff is cheerful and pleasant.","2176":"I'd like to make it 3 1\/2... this is not an inexpensive place - so my expectations are higher here than most places on the area.  First - there were 9 people on our party - we had a reservation for noon - and we arrived a few minutes early .  We all ordered at the same time - but not all meals arrived at the same time - the last meal delivered arrived about 10 minutes after everyone else had been served.  One member of our party asked if there were bell peppers in a dish - and stated they are allergic - the server indicated there were not - when the meals arrived -  there were chopped bell peppers.  The food was fine, but at the offered price point every aspect of the meal should have been better.","2177":"Really scenic restaurant on the Grounds of Sculpture. I would recommend making a reservation.\n\nThey are on the pricey side but it's worth it. I really enjoyed the crab cake and seafood salad. They also serve alcohol. Outdoor seating only right now due to COVID.","2178":"The idea of a southern gastropub is actualized in The Parish. The atmosphere was delightful with a diverse crowd of patrons. The bartenders were funny and able to make up cocktails on the spot. As a southerner transplated to Tucson I had pipe dreams of finding a good Po'Boy. I was floored by the authentic Shrimp Po'Boy with delicious remoulade and hush puppies on the side. I will definitely be back!","2179":"Hands down the best Cajun food in Tucson!  We started with mussels and the frog legs which were a first time and they were amazing! Then we split the shrimp and grits and the angel pasta. The shrimp and grits was the best I've ever had! Crunchy grits with the most amazing sauce I've ever had and perfectly cooked shrimp. The kids had grilled cheese and they were enormous! The staff was so accommodating and took care of us with a smile! We're definitely going back before we leave! A must try!","2180":"I dined here with my husband & his family (8 of us total) and had a pretty good experience! I will say that we did call a couple of other restaurants in the area but they weren't able to get a group of us in on Saturday night. Ending up at The Parish though was definitely a good thing! It's a cute little restaurant, I'd say more of a date night dinner place than a family restaurant as it had a more relaxed, intimate atmosphere.\n\nWe started off with drinks & then ordered dinner. The choices at the table included Guedry's Gumbo, Drunken Angel, The Tchoup, & The Tomahawk Special. I personally went a simple salad, The Garden District with Smoked Salmon. My husband liked his choice of The Tchoup which was a bone-in pork chop with BBQ sauce, apple kraut, and a sweet potato puree. His mom really enjoyed the Tomahawk Special, it looked too pretty to eat! The others liked their orders as well, minus the Gumbo as it wasn't found to be a hearty dish, lacking chicken and sausage. They did accommodate by bringing out some sausage on the side but the 3 who got it were still a bit disappointed. I enjoyed my salad and found the Smoked Salmon to be tasty; I was told they smoke the salmon in-house.\n\nOverall, we thought this was a good choice and a restaurant we would come back to. The Shrimp & Grits have been calling my name ever since! Can't wait to try that dish ... and maybe some Bread Pudding too next time.","2181":"Really cool vibe and delicious food. The chef h\nShow great pride in their food and it shows. The pasta was sooo yummy (drunken angel) and I would come back for it.","2182":"We decided to try this restaurant on the recommendation of a Tucson food publication. I gave them one star for generous portions and a tasty appetizer and sides, and one star for our waitress. We were there Friday 10\/1\/21 around 5 PM. The hostess was a little discombobulated on our arrival, but she seemed to be training someone and they were accommodating and pleasant. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We started with the brussel sprouts appetizer, and it was delicious- spicy and sweet, with the pecans adding a nice crunch. We had high expectations for the meal after a great start.\n\nUnfortunately, our sandwiches did not live up to the hype and were a big disappointment, and my partner was unable to eat his. I ordered the pulled pork with the coleslaw side. I enjoyed the coleslaw. It was fresh but I didn't find it spicy, despite the name. My pulled pork sandwich was soggy and I think they must have forgot to add the habanero aioli. It was warm at best, and there were even a few cold spots- like it had been reheated in a microwave. My partner had the sausage po boy and it was flat out cold- like it came out of the fridge. At first they offered to heat it for him, after he politely asked if it was supposed to be served hot or cold. The waitress told us it was supposed to be hot- what we expected based on eating po boys at other establishments over the years. When my partner told them his sandwich was cold, and not just \"not hot\" they offered to redo it. We got the sandwich to go but he did not eat it. His side of red beans and rice was very good, and he did eat that.\n\nWe received a bill for $40 for two cold pork sandwiches that we're meant to be served hot, along with an appetizer. They apologized but didn't go out of their way to make our experience better.\n\nThey clearly prepare some items ahead of time and reheat some plates in a way that seems inappropriate given that they were serving pork and charged us  $13-15 for said sandwiches.\n\nThere are so many 4 and 5 star reviews, so perhaps our experience was isolated, but in searching the reviews I did find a couple of other reviews in recent months complaining of cold food. \n\nWe just felt tense upon leaving, like \"Are we going to get sick?\" We didn't, but it's not how we like to feel after dining out.","2183":"This place was great! Noisy yes but I think if u go earlier than 6:30 would be fine. The food was wonderful.  So rich and filling and SO New Orleans! Wish I knew how they make the burgundy pasta.","2184":"The Best. EVERYTHING on the menu is great. And! They make fantastic special drinks and good selection of beers, etc!\nIf you have not had The Parish Burger... go get one!!","2185":"One of my very favorite places! The ambiance, the friendly staff, the great food. Liquor a infused with different flavors, craft beers on tap, oh, and did I mention the food? Bacon popcorn.. Wha!? Goat cheese chili relleno! Smoked Angel, the ginormous pork chop... So hard to pick just one!","2186":"Another little Tucson gem. Very cool vibe and great staff. Great bar. We had the Parish Burger and Gumbo w\/shrimp. Filling and delightful.\n\nMenu was simple but super unique. We don't do seafood often, so probably not the best for providing a review in that department, but bottom line, we'll be back with friends.","2187":"My sister and I were looking for a fun place to go to dinner this weekend, and one of my friends is always raving about The Parish, so we figured why not?  Totally wish we would have come here sooner!  Such a cool little restaurant!\nThe drinks- OMG.  They have house-infused vodkas- which is by far the fastest way to my heart.  I had the Parishioner- basil-infused vodka, lemon juice and grape fruit bitters.  Seriously, the most refreshing drink I have had in a while.  It was perfect.  My sister had the Aqua Vida- vodka, mint, peach bitters, lemon, and cranberry juice, it was slightly sweeter than my drink but perfectly balanced with the tartness of the lemon and perfect amount of mint.\nThe food- we did what we always do when we get to a new restaurant- Tour de appetizers.  We chose four- the pimpanadas, the fries, the goat cheese relleno, and the bacon and eggs.  The pimpanadas- filled with jerk chicken, topped with peach marmalade and spiced plantains- delicious, but not my favorite app here.  The fries- delicious and served with 3 dipping sauces.  I will be craving these at midnight for the rest of my life.  The goat cheese relleno was perfect, so delicious.  The bacon and eggs was by far my favorite.  The egg was poached to perfection, the pork belly was delicious and cooked to perfects, but the icing on the cake was the grit cake- amazing, cheese, crispy- I will never eat normal grits again, only in the form of a deep fried nugget.  Next time we will save room for dessert.\nThe service- the waiter was super friendly and encouraging of our choices.\nThe atmosphere- I love it!  It has such an organic feel.  It feels like how I would decorate my house.  Some of the new restaurants in town feel so fake- like perfectly decorated.  This place has a mishmash feel that makes you feel at home!  The bar is great and the colors are awesome.  Love the church pew booths.\nIf you haven't been here, go tonight!","2188":"Came here for their Fat Tuesday\/Mardi Gras celebration and it was a hoot! So cool that Tucson actually had a celebration for it and it was great because I've always wanted to celebrate\/try our traditional New Orleans food but have never been able to actually go! It was $10 cover and when you came in, they handed out free beads and a voucher for a free hurricane! They had huge roasted gator that they flew in and was smoked on the grill which was awesome! Tasted like a little gamier chicken with a great smoked flavor. I got the sample platter that came with collard greens, red beans and rice, chicken and andouille gumbo, cornbread, a hush puppy and 2 crawfish. Talk about a complete taste of Louisiana on a plate! Everything was delicious. My personal favorite was the hush puppy!! So crispy and not dry at all! My cousin got the BBQ shrimp that was very fresh and had a nice kick to it! The king cake was a little dry for my liking, but maybe that's just how king cake is? Super fun decorations and music for the event! I definitely want to come back to try their normal menu too!","2189":"I really enjoyed the dinner here. It's hard to find a fairly decent French restaurant in the suburbs. Rat's fulfills this need. It's not Daniel or Le Veau D'or but for a 20 minute drive it fills a much needed gap. The service and food was great. I don't really have anything to complain about.","2190":"The food was tasty but I prefer a healthier menu. There isn't much that isn't fried. The service was good.","2191":"We went here for the  first time Saturday. That wait was about 15 minutes which wasn't bad on a Saturday at 6:30. The items in the menu are perfect portions. There were a few of us so we ordered the following. The food was to die for and I'll return a million more times. \n\nSteak and Frittes- the sauce on the steak was to die for. The steak cooked perfect to my friends liking. \n\nOysters on a half shell app- only three cAme for the price of $9.00 so I was a bit weary but the size of these made up for it and would equal 6 oysters at other restaurants. \n\nParish burger- looked great and my friend who ordered it said it was wonderful.\n\nGoat cheese Relleno- I wanted 10 more after I tasted this.\n\nShrimp and grits- the take on this was so different and tasty.","2192":"Get the burger! Omg... the BEST burger ever!!! We also love the bacon popcorn and the cornbread.","2193":"Excellent food. Great drinks. The staff is very attentive. My wife and I love this place.","2194":"2 stars for hushpuppies, cocktails and presentation. Otherwise, left a lot to desire. Will not return.","2195":"A little piece of New Orleans in Tucson. The atmosphere is perfect and attention was paid to every detail making it so spot on Nawlins'. The have a great selection of unique and interesting drinks. The food is so greasy and delicious. I can't wait to come back to Tucson ti bring my friends here!","2196":"My wife and I went to Rat's for Valentine's Day, the weekend after. We had never been there, but the reviews on Open Table were high and we wanted to try something different. The ambiance was great, but right away we saw the service was horrible.  Our server, Lara, barely paid attention to us, and she did not have many tables.  After we received our food, she gave us a quick \"how is everythig\" and then we didn't see her again for a good 20 minutes. By that time we were finished eating, needed more water, and just wanted to leave.  Once she finally came by we asked for the check, and didn't get it for another 10 minutes.  The food was ok, but expensive for what we got.  We had a few dietary changes, and she seemed very confused by them.  We always tip at least 20%...we had to make an exception  this time.  We won't be going back.","2197":"Better than your standard pub food.\n\nService - 5 stars, attentive and dog friendly.\n\nFood - Had the pretzel and cheese appetizer which was great.  Soft pretzel balls and a mini fondue cheese dip. The Pub burger hit the spot.  Cooked to order and not your lazy frozen patty burger which is all too common these days. Finally the Monkey Bread which is basically a deconstructed apple pie.  Moist, not too sweet and served a la mode. \n\nI noticed some fire places and a few games like corn hole in the back but didn't get a chance to check that area out.  Worth a stop.","2198":"2.5 stars.\nFemale bartender was very nice and made drinks when we were ready. \nMale bartender took forever to acknowledge us and never brought waters when we asked once. \nOverall, the infusions were great. Probably won't come back because of garbage service.","2199":"Good food!\nAverage service. The waiter would disappear and forgot to bring the spicy salsa, by the time he did, the food was cold.","2200":"It's been about 2 years since I've visited, but Rat's is probably my most visited Mercer county restaurant. Years ago they had great wine( and other booze paired) diners, and a monthly wine class with a great Som. That era ended, and based on this trip, the new era leaves much to be desired. \n\nI'm still a fan of the happy hour, whether inside or on the patio, and of course the decor and ambiance. But last nights diner was possibly the least enjoyed one of my few dozen other meals here. \n\nOne thing that used to set Rats apart from other upscale joints was the amuse bouche, that was absent on this night. The popovers are still there, but were a bit different and on the overbaked side. The bread service is now down to one variety( French baguette) when there used to be 3, one of which was an incredible raisin nut loaf.\n\nWe started with a cheese plate, it was ok, probably not as inspired or interesting as some I've had, and instead of Marcona almonds, there seemed to be Planters mixed nuts as one of the components. My dining companion ordered the potato leek raviolis, I didn't taste because the portion was more on an appetizer scale, she said they were good. I ordered an old standby, coq au vin, but it was much different than other preparations of this dish that I've had here. Very little sauce, burnt bacon lardons, and an almost BBQ chicken sitting on top. They use great quality chicken( Griggstown likely) but this was a bit over cooked. \n\nNothing on the dessert menu grabbed our attention, and that in itself is rare for me. But I'll reserve judgment in that category. But the ever present sweets with check was also absent? For those of you who haven't dined here in their heyday, they used to bring out a tray of house made candies and or cookies, usually a few tastes for each diner. \n\nService was ok, but that has always been an issue here, inconsistency in that department. Ours was very friendly but I wonder how knowledgeable about the dishes and ingredients. I also did not see the long time manager who always remembered me, possibly a night off? I'm rounding up slightly because of the overall vibe and great dining partner, but for now I'll stick with their HH when I return.","2201":"My wife and I tried the parish for lunch about a week ago I could not believe how awesome everyone is there the owner actually came out to make sure everything was to our liking food and atmosphere were nothing short of awesome thanks for the great lunch we will definitely be back.","2202":"Being fairly new to Tucson I had to check out the locally owned restaurants and I must say, I've never had southern food so wonderful! The frog legs were almost as amazing as the HUGE pork chop I ordered! I ended up having two meals out of the one meal I ordered because there was THAT much food on the plate. Almost as if the owner knew how amazing his food was as a midnight snack!\nI will be coming here again and again.\nThank you Brice for coming by our table to introduce yourself, your food and restaurant are superb.","2203":"Interesting menu, wonderful flavors.  Their appetizer of bacon buttered popcorn was outstanding.  My companion loved the meld of flavors on her burger, and I enjoyed my Drunken Angel...crawfish, shrimp, angel hair pasta, in a lobster broth.  There was wine in there too, which made the pasta look like whole wheat pasta, but it wasn't.  It was the wine.  My companion had their one and only dessert, bread pudding.  It was served warm with whipped cream on top.  It had hints of chocolate, citrus, and caramel.  All was declared delicious!!  I am looking forward to returning to this one-of-a-kind restaurant here in Tucson.","2204":"A-MAZ-ING. My family is from Louisiana. This food is ON POINT! In fact, we are going back this weekend for happy hour \u200d. Gumbo is DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Thank you for bringing a piece of home to the West!","2205":"The bomb!  Great vibe, delicious food, exquisite cocktails.  Relaxed, friendly, and comfortable.  We tried the bacon popcorn and hush puppies with a beer and margarita - classic.  Great for a date night, casual hang-out, or meet-up with friends.","2206":"We saw this restaurant as we wondered through Grounds of Sculptures, came on a Saturday. We made a reservation online at their website. Overall the inside looks very pretty and the outside was very nice as you can look over to some of the sculptures. They also have a  pond of koi fish exposed to the outside area. We just wanted something small to snack on. We got the Cheese and Charcuterie board for 24 dollars. It came with 3 cheeses, and 3 meats. For refreshments, boyfriend got the pomegranate drink and I got the thyme lemonade at $6. Both of these drinks came out AMAZING! Overall it was very good the whole environment and vibes to it was very nice.","2207":"Worst food I and my wife have ever eaten.  Buns were old and hard (not by design) Pickle had black spots didn't sample it. Salad was nothing special very pedestrian not worth 8 bucks. Service was good. That was our first and last visit. Although we must have missed something because the star ratings were good. As I said we won't be going back.","2208":"O. M. Gosh!!  This was nothing short of excellent!!  The service was on point and the food was whatever word is a Higher rating than delicious! It is a lovely eclectically decorated location that is both welcoming and personable. It is so worth visiting and a lovely addition to oro valley!!  Kelsey was our server and she was timely in her service yet not invasive. Highly recommend this location.","2209":"Our anniversary seemed like a good reason to finally go to Rat's for dinner. The restaurant is striking in design and the bar area is quite cozy. We dined upstairs in a small room to the right of the stairs (only 5 tables with a functioning fireplace) and our experience was very good. Nothing was rushed and the room was being covered by two individuals. \n\nWe started off by sharing the Tuna Tartare appetizer along with the Traditional Onion Soup, that seemed like an obvious choice in a French inspired restaurant. Both were excellent. Entrees consisted of a wonderful Halibut dish for Carol and the Short Ribs for me. Both were excellent - just enough and not the huge plates you may see elsewhere. There were no leftovers and we were satisfied with our meals.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Torta Barozzi, something I had enjoyed months earlier at a Yelp event. Everything was accompanied by a very good Predator Zinfadel (red, not white). \n\nWhile not inexpensive I wholeheartedly recommend Rat's for that special occasion dinner or brunch. It is a transformative experience.","2210":"This place lives up to the great reviews. I based what I ordered off of the reviews and had the drunken angel. Waaay too rich for my liking but had great saffron flavor. I can't say I'd order it again because it's hard to have more than a few bites. The gumbo with hush puppies on the other hand was fantastic. I recommend that over the pasta dish. They brought us a complimentary bread pudding for my bf's birthday, and WOW, do not leave the restaurant without getting one! The best bread pudding I've ever had! We will be back!","2211":"First visit at the Parish with friends. Great atmosphere, great service (waitress was great), and the food was great! I would recommend the popcorn, and cornbread. I had the Drunkin Pasta which I would highly recommend. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because our credit card got lost on the way to the kitchen for at least 15 min. The owner and waitress did come out and let us know they were searching for it, however I felt at that point the whole meal should have been free. Thankfully after about another 5 minutes, right before calling to get the card canceled it was found. Other than that, the place is wonderful.","2212":"Came here on a Saturday night for a special occasion and had an absolutely amazing experience.\n\nWe walked the park for an hour or so before going to dinner which was a great segue.  The staff was fantastic, not only accommodating the special occasion but provided us a perfect seat right on the water for celebrate the evening, they were even nice enough to move us to a table closer to the heat lamps as the night went on!\n\nThe waiter was knowledgeable, polite, and frank about their recommendations.\n\nI had the duck while my date had the eggplant, both fantastic and accented with two appetizers which was the fresh heirloom tomatoes and short rib ravioli.\n\nHad the ultimate old fashion, which while not the best I've ever had, was certainly good enough for a quality meal.\n\nHighly recommended date spot especially for any special occasion.","2213":"We went for our anniversary and it was wonderful.  The food was amazing and the service excellent.  I had the duck and a side of Brussel sprouts.  The duck was very good but the Brussel sprouts were to. Die. For.  Do not miss out.  The side is pretty big and would be fabulous as an appetizer.","2214":"This is my 4th time dining at Rats and the best overall dining experience we have had here. The ambiance, food and service were excellent. I've also attended various special events here. \n\nAmbiance: For me, this is the main draw to this restaurant.  I'm transported to a different time and place; the landscape, flora and sculptures are breath taking.  The entire scene lends itself to amazing photographs. I love the peaceful and serene environment created here.  If you have time, go visit the adjoining Grounds for Sculpture which is amazing as well.\n\nFood:  The food is expensive, but think of it as part entrance fee to roam about the gardens at Rats.  We ordered the Madame Croque and the Eggplant \"mignon\".  I try to eat vegetarian when I can and most restaurants don't seem to get it right.  Rats was on point with this eggplant dish.  It literally looks like a filet mignon, but with the accompanying ratatouille it was an enjoyable, light and healthy lunch option.  The herbed cream cheese and butter spread was delicious; don't watch your carbs here, just indulge.  We did!\n\nService:  Our waitress was phenomenal.  She was friendly, efficient, knew the menu well, and was able to describe the entrees and make recommendations.  She was even kind enough to bring us a complimentary sorbet dessert, since we were celebrating a birthday.\n\nSpecial Events:  Rats throws some great special events throughout the year including a Dance Club Night, Salsa Night, and a Halloween Party.  I've attended all of them and have had an amazing time at each.  The events do get quite crowded.","2215":"I went to the sculpture garden in Princeton and while I was there,I went to the rat's restaurant. I thought that the Rat's restaurant was delicious! If you're a kid, than I should really suggest that you get the pasta with butter and cheese. it was outstanding! The waiters were also very nice! The Rat's restaurant was very good!","2216":"Love this place-a great, unique boutique shop in the heart of Reno!","2217":"I reserved the Parlor Room at The Parish for a dinner party of 8 last night. The room is lovely and perfect for our group! Our server was excellent! He was attentive, helpful and flowed our courses well. The food was delicious and all of my guests were quite happy! We ordered a selection of dishes including the frog legs, bacon popcorn, Brussel sprouts & skillet corn bread for starters. Entrees included drunken angel (my personal favorite), cat fish dinners, gumbo and special chicken sandwich!","2218":"Went for Valentine's day. It was a four course meal with dessert (splendid) with wine pairing for each course. Service was great. Ambiance unbeatable and food and wine delicious.","2219":"You will love this place.  Everything I have tried thus far is super delicious.  You won't regret it after you try it.","2220":"If you don't mind the crowd and want to have a beautiful view, this is good place. But the dinning experience is rendered duo to the crowd.\n\nFood\nThe onion soup is impressive, make sure you get that. The steak is ok, a little over done as I ordered it as medium. I don't feel it excel their peers within similar price range. \n\nEnvironment\nThe restaurant is on the edge of the Trenton sculpture park, so it has a very beautiful backyard with several piece of art work. It also has a little side door to go into the park and you can buy ticket on the spot.\nThis is definitely can be a very romantic choice for wedding.\n\nService \nI am not really impressed by the service. I read the reviews on yelp so I know it'a crowded, and I made reservation in advance. But I still ended up waiting at the door for over half hour, then what is point of making reservation? \nI understand they are busy, and the service is kind of slow. But since you are here for a long nice meal, it wouldn't bother you too much. \n\nParking\nThis is an issue on the busy days. There are not enough parking slots, and even the side of road was totally full. I spent at least 10 minutes driving around to find the spot.\nIn a word: avoid to go there in weekend.","2221":"Brutal. Our drinks were served long after the food and my drink was served in a glass that was dirty and felt like it had maple syrup rubbed all over it. My wife's salad was basic and at least $2 overpriced for what it was and the waitress upsold me on adding an eggplant patty to my pasta which was definitely a mistake. The pasta ($18) and the eggplant patty ($6) were not worth $12 combined. The flavors in the pasta clashed and the goat cheese was much too strong for the dish. Trying to figure out how this place has 4.5 stars with 600+ reviews. Wouldn't survive a year in Phoenix... tremendously disappointed.","2222":"Ive been to Rat's before for lunch a few years ago and thought I'd try it out for dinner. It was really underwhelming. The decor is great. The inside is beautiful and fun and exciting. Unfortunately, we had a lot of cleanliness issues. The booth we were sat in was COVERED in crumbs- it was unbelievable how many there were and that no one had noticed. Clearly the booth hadn't been cleaned before we sat there. My boyfriend's butter knife had crusted food on it and I had to ask the waiter for a wet wipe because the table had a spilled drink on it! I'm not sure they even cleaned the table beforehand  The food was okay. The mezze was nice. The brussel sprouts were tough and undercooked, and the bacon was just fat. Our server was nice, I just don't think it was worth the money and the cleanliness issues make you realize how many steps are being skipped when it comes to sanitation here.","2223":"I really wanted to like this place and heard about it for a long time and drove across town to try it but there were just so many things that weren't so fantastic like the wine was served at or above Room temperature which I understand some people think red wine should be at Room temperature but in my humble opinion it should be somewhere in cellar temperature range more like 55 to 65\uff9f and I have to say the wine may be a little bruised like the bottle had been open for a while but I did not complain I just put some ice in my wine and I have to say the food really wasn't amazing like I thought it would be everything was kind of lacking some seasoning and the coleslaw was really just shredded cabbage and some vinegar without really much spices or flavoring so the place was OK and they have amazing cocktails and a nice selection of beers and great ambience and the service was pretty good but the food just was so so....","2224":"We've eaten here a few times and the food hasn't disappointed us. We even order a smoked Turkey last Thanksgiving and it was superb! Definitely recommend this place if you haven't had it before.","2225":"Great place. A FOOD restaurant. Clean place and great staff. Could have better drink specials for what it is. Other than that love this place. We go here every other Sunday. And have never had a bad time.","2226":"While the garden setting of this restaurant is always a delight, the food has gone a bit downhill recently. I've been going to Rat's ever since they first opened, and seen a few different approaches by the successive chefs. With the great spring weather, my husband and I played hooky from work to sit for a late casual lunch on the beautiful patio. The food, however was skimpy, bland, and not prepared with the kind of skill evident in the past.\n\nHonestly, it felt like someone was trying to squeeze a few more pennies out of each plate that was served. I'm used to the smaller portions associated with French food, but after splitting an appetizer and two entrees, we left feeling like we needed to go somewhere to get something to eat. This was different from our previous visits to Rat's.\n\nThere were some newer items on the menu, and some older favorites as well. We always ordered the smoked salmon appetizer in the past, and did this time as well. When it arrived, it was an enormous disappointment. The previous iteration was a lovely terrine of moist salmon, more like cooked salmon that had been smoked than what one might think of as traditional smoked salmon. It was unctuous and filling and served with ample toast to enjoy it on and creme fraiche, I believe. This time, the dish consisted of 3 slices of traditional smoked salmon with some dollops of a nice green sauce and some parsley and shaved radish. The flavor was ok, but the whole thing was quite uninspired, and a big let down from what we were expecting. It was served with a slice and a half of overly grilled bread. \n\nSpeaking of bread, the bread basket put on the table was a pedestrian pile of baguette slices, where once there was a variety, and the chive butter was nothing like the much yummier version one used to get with it.  \n\nFor the main course, we ordered the Trout Meuniere and the Vegetable Tart. If you order the trout, don't expect the perfectly crispy skinned and citrusy yummyness that they used to serve up. This trout was flaccid and bland, and utterly forgettable. The sauce looked like the stuff one squeezes out of Chinese food orange packets, but with less flavor. \n\nThe vegetable tart was also bland. It was like a tiny little island in the middle of an ample ocean of under-dressed greens. The puff pastry was mostly crispy, but the vegetables and ricotta inside it were flavorless and underseasoned. We split the portion into two, as we did with the trout, but we could have easily eaten twice as much of everything.\n\nThe beauty of French food, is that it's supposed to make up for its smaller portion size with big flavors that one can savor. The food we ate during our most recent visit to Rat's fell short on both portion and taste, so I really don't see myself coming back anytime in the near future unless there is some kind of major change. \n\nFor the price, you're much better off eating at the Peacock Cafe when you visit the GFS for lunch. I really hope Rat's sees this, though, and ups its game. I know the regular flow of new visitors that the GFS delivers could make them complacent, but to become unconcerned with the possibility of losing the local crowd would be a shame for all of us.","2227":"I've heard so much about this place and how interesting the grounds for sculpture is. Finally got to come here for dinner. I was told it's really pretty during the day when you can look outside. The bar area has a Moroccan theme. We were seated at the main dining area by a roaring fireplace. The earliest Open table reservations we got were for 8pm even though when we got there at 7.30pm there were available tables. So definitely call if the time isn't available  on open table. \n\nWe started with some cocktails. There were a lot of interesting sounding cocktails on the menu but I chose the classic Pimms cup to see how it would stack up. I definitely enjoyed it. \n\nWe then started with the cheese platter during which my date requested for Cabernet Sauvignon to go with the platter. The platter came with three types of cheeses with honeycomb and apricot jam on the side. The Gouda was absolutely delicious. And of course it is! It's Dutch! (I didn't know too much about cheese and found out that night that Gouda is named after the city. Whoops.)\n\nMoving on to my favorite type of cheese: the melted kind was oh so good on top of my French onion soup. Ate every bit.\nThe mussels were absolutely amazing too. Cooked perfectly in a really flavorful red broth. \n\nAs an entree I ordered the smoked duck breast over lentils. I have to say I wasn't as fond of this dish. My date and I thought the flavor tasted more like ham than duck which is a bit odd. The Kobe beef on the other hand was really good.\n\nWe struggled abit with the dessert selection because the waitress recommended donuts but I was really craving creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e didn't disappoint because it was worth every bite.\n\nI definitely would like to return during the day for lunch\/brunch or happy hour when it's nicer out. Service was great and we got to take our time. \n\nFun fact: Found out from the waitress towards the end of the night that Sbraga was executive chef here when he won Top Chef a couple years ago! Definitely recognized the popovers at Rat's from when I dined at Sbraga a couple weeks ago!","2228":"We usually go to Rats for a celebratory meal, birthday, anniversary & the like.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each dining experience.  I do like sitting by the windows overlooking the lovey gardens of the Grounds for Sculpture.  I have always had very good servers, very polite & helpful.","2229":"Checked out the reviews for the nearby restaurants and The Parish caught my eye with their menu and good reviews. We were not disappointed. First off we enjoyed a drink at our hotel and placed ourselves on the waitlist through Yelp! We got the restaurant a few minutes prior to our check in time and were seated almost immediately. We ordered some cucumber margaritas with Tajin on the rim at the recommendation of our waitress who said the drink was light and refreshing. She was right on! I ordered the Drunken Angel and my wife had the Parish Burger. Our food came out promptly and was delicious! My wife's burger was cooked perfectly and she loved the red onion marmalade and bleu cheese. She enjoyed the coleslaw which was lightly flavored and accented her burger tastefully. The pasta lived up to the hype. It was chock full of seafood and the sauce was rich but so flavorful! We were attended to but not overly so. The atmosphere was electric and fun. The bartenders showed a lot of energy and the staff was friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Tucson.","2230":"This was a huge disappointment! Been coming here every year for an afternoon snack. Decided to book a Sunday brunch with friends. Our server was a big lady who seemed uninterested to serve us. She didn't introduce herself. I asked if there's ala cart menu, of which I got an impolite response, \"Only buffet!\" as if I've asked a stupid question. My friend got the same rude response when she asked if there's cream for coffee. She answered \"on the table!\" She's a bit heavy so she kept on banging our chair when she passed by and while we were eating, which was very disruptive. In any case, whenever we need her she was nowhere to be found. For a 62.00 buffet and no drinks included (we spent $91 each because of drinks and coffee), this was such a huge, huge disaster and disappointment!","2231":"After going to Rat's for the first time this past weekend I am so mad that I didn't try it earlier on.  The entire grounds were amazing and meticulously maintained. You feel like you are in a surreal fairytale land for your entire visit. I love the quaintness in the dinning room and bar which gives it a very intimate relaxed vibe. The outdoor dinning patio had beautiful views of several sculptures.  For drinks we chose a nice light Pinot Grigio (moderatly priced) from the wine list - very enjoyable. Instead of entree's we selected several appetizers to nosh on. Everything was enjoyable! The mussels were a standout as well as the cold asparagus salad.  Will absolutely be back - can't wait!","2232":"I love there food great atmosphere and great food. Love the drink list also. If you have not tried the parish treat yourself to a little bit of New Orleans. Great place","2233":"Ate here for the 3rd time and the experience definitely dropped significantly and let me down. First off, our server seemed annoyed and was not as friendly as he should have been given the prices of this place. Not sure if he was irritated that we had a 2 year old with us, or if it bothered him that my mom wasn't sure of what to order (she had trouble reading the menu) given her eyesight, but he was not good and we never felt welcomed, more like we were his next table of the shift he couldn't wait to finish. Sad, because our previous servers were solid and accommodating. The food took a long time go arrive. Uncomfortably long in fact given it was clear our party of 6 were all wondering where the food was even though we didn't discuss it. When the food arrived, everything was just ok. The ravioli was a tiny portion, the schnitzel was simple and boring, the braised short rib was tender but desperately needed a sauce that the drizzle of cabernet did not come close to achieving, and the chicken dish was just alright. The restaurant was accommodating to my 2 year old niece, and provided a high chair and crayons and paper to draw on so big points there. But the meal wasn't worth half of what we paid and our server seemed like he genuinely didn't care about our experience. Also worth noting that our server was unwilling to split our bill 3 ways for a party of 6 (each couple wanted to pay) - saying it was \"complicated.\" I call that lazy.  After 2 very solid meals and experiences beforehand, this one left a bad taste in my mouth.","2234":"Since I have already eaten at The Peacock Cafe, I wanted to step it up and eat at Rat's Restaurant.  \nI decided to try the Rabbit Ragot. It was delicious, but the noodles were very thick making it hard to twirl with a fork.  I have great dexterity with my hands and I was a having hard time staying classy eating this dish. If you are a messy eater I wouldn't recommend ordering it, but if you aren't, the taste is worth the extra work to eat it. \n \nThe portions are small for the price, but it is french food.  French food is hard to cook because the detail that is given to the food.  This is a place you go to appreciate good food, but if you're seriously starving at Grounds for Sculpture and don't want to order multiple dishes, go to the Peacock Cafe.","2235":"Saw this place had such high reviews we couldn't pass it up. Love the decor and the staff is so friendly. I'm not sure if we came on a bad day but the food wasn't as amazing as I expected. Looked forward to the watermelon salad, but found it drowning in way to spicy dressing that over powered the flavors of the dish. The beer battered catfish and the cornbread were delightful. Drowning pasta dish was just that, drowning in sauce that left a funny taste in your mouth when not eaten with the pasta. Server recommended the chert cheesecake...(apparently it's a new invention) and the break pudding. Neither were good. Odd flavor combinations. We loved loved the adult beverages.  This is a great place for a drink and appetizer.","2236":"We stopped in on a Friday night for drinks and food and everything was SO GOOD!! Chelsea was our waitress for the night, and she was funny, kind, and made our visit even better! The live music was fun, and upbeat, and so was the atmosphere. Our drinks were delicious, refreshing and nothing was overly sweet - the flavors packed a good punch and they went down smooth. \n\nThe food... we couldn't make a decision so we literally didn't. We tried everything (or as close to it is humanly possible for two people). And it was incredible. The frog legs and elote were phenomenal, the bacon popcorn was unlike anything I've tried and went so well with all of the drinks - the brussel sprouts and cornbread were also just on point. We don't live nearby, but if we did this would be sure to be a favorite!","2237":"Delicious, I've been twice and will be a regular the food is amazing and have never been disappointed in any aspect of the experience!! Home run!","2238":"I came in today to inquire regarding the possibility of a party. Basically was shot down, which is fine as I understand they couldn't accommodate the amount of people we had, but whoever I spoke with was quite snippy and rude about it. This is basic customer service. Would carefully think about replies next time.","2239":"Kelsey was the bartender and she made the perfect margarita. Not too sweet or strong. Great lime and a little ginger \/ cucumber flavor.","2240":"Second time here and Rat's delivered again. Phenomenal service, excellent food, and a simply beautiful restaurant. Our table had the burger, French dip, and Turkey croissant and everyone loved their meal. Cocktails were made well and my soon to be mother in law said the sangria was the best that she's had. Can't recommend this place enough.","2241":"I would give it a 10 if I could. From the moment we walked through the door, it screamed fun. Service was impeccable, the food was imaginative and delicious, the decor was phenomenal, and even a plain vodka\/tonic was inspired (that means not for amateurs). Love love love this place and can't wait to go back and try something new. To the staff - thanks for the blast !","2242":"I love this place...I give it 4.5 stars, and it will go to 5 once they bring back my crawfish hushpuppies!","2243":"Rat's is a great hidden gem, it can seem pricey but they have GREAT specials during happy hour! (5- 7) I recommend visiting then and checking out nearby grounds which are delightful!","2244":"Thank You Parish Restaurant Management and Staff for an amazing dining experience last evening Saturday, October 17, 2020.  We did the ahead seating which provides a timed check in.  I had not seen that before.  Very nice.  We wanted outdoor seating, but took the inside and was quite pleasantly surprised-  social respectful distancing obvious, clean.  The menu options offered paper or online through a scan process.  We chose the scan option, but our server more than made up for providing additional assistance on our selections.  We were seated and immediately offered water and drinks by our server.  As we surveyed the tables and portions most beautiful and inviting for consumption.  I am a Vegetarian and somewhat picky- not a problem.  We shared Brussels sprout with an amazing kick and then I chose a vegetarian pasta dish with added mushrooms at the encouragement by my waiter as well as an amazing glass of red wine.  So much food- took away my dish and more for the next day.  Needless to say, AMAZING service in this time of COVID.  Note: they even had a designated seated waiting area outside. YOU GO Parish!  We will be Back.  Thank you!","2245":"Southern Fusion...I went in with high expectations based on previous reviews and I was a little let down.  The flavors just weren't there for me but the sauce and ketchup helped but I usually don't indulge in either.  I got the hush puppies to start and was given five on a bed of red cabbage.  They were fried hard just the way I like but the middle was just right but unfortunately, they were bland.  I still enjoyed them after indulging in the sauce provided.  My entree was the Mississippi Catfish with a housemade tarter sauce.  Again, bland but it was moist and fluffy.  I enjoyed the meal and I'll definitely return to try other things that stood out on the menu like the bacon popcorn!","2246":"This seemed like a restaurant that rushed to open before they could assess what it would take to give customers a good food and visual experience during Covid. That's all I'm going to say.","2247":"I don't know how this place just gets better and better every time we eat here but it does!  Amazing food and service (Stephanie). Our favorite place to eat","2248":"If there was such a thing as perfection.....\n\nI felt like a fairy princess . The scenery is breathtaking. I literally felt like I was having dinner in a fairy tale. \n\nThe food was outstanding. Started with a great salad with fresh anise , radish and quinoa. The cheese board was delish I fell in love with the berry jam on the crostini. \n\nFor vegans there is the cauliflower which was unreal such a unique taste . The bronzazi fish was also a highlight. \n\nI have to add the sangria was tasty and you only need one it has so much kick","2249":"Absolutely everything on this menu is amazing!   Truly a one of a kind experience.  Definitely a must if you're a Tucson visitor.  Love,love this place!","2250":"This is my second visit there, and it was good like last time, but also had the same problem as the last time. I had steak and fries this time and drunken angel last time. I think it's their signature to add alcohol in their dishes and it was very different. I wanted my steak medium but I think it was more like medium well but no biggie cause the ny strip was only like half inch thick so it's understandable. The problem I had was the food was overly salty, and I had this problem last time too. I swear I had to drink gallons of water the rest of the afternoon and still feel thirsty. But other than that I think the food was really good","2251":"The food was very good and the service was amazing, the short ribs where a bit bland but salt and pepper fixed them up just fine the French onion soup was delicious and I loved the whiskey cake, along with the cappuccino.","2252":"The food was pretty bomb! The prickly tea was 10\/10 and the burger was fireeee (parish burger)","2253":"We love the Parish. The food is delicious and the drinks are great, too. Great bartenders and servers. I love the Dutch Well Water. It tastes great and is sneaky because you barely can tell you're drinking alcohol.","2254":"Sex on a plate!! If nothing else, try the bread pudding.  Favorite new restaurant  Pork rinds, hot crispy, fluffy. Infused alcohol, try a shot of something different; strawberry habenaro hot, hot, hot. Brown butter whiskey envelopes you like a warm blanket pulled from the dryer. Gumbo, go ahead add the shrimp and crayfish, you won't be disappointed. But ohhhhh, the bread pudding....","2255":"This place was awesome!! First time I have ever been here was a couple weeks ago. Felt very safe, protocols in place with masks. Plenty of distance between tables while maintaining a cozy and warm atmosphere. The drinks were delicious and seemed unique to this location which is always fun! The service was slow and we ended up there for much longer than intended but luckily it was a girls night out so that was ok, but I don't recommend coming here if you are wanting to eat and head out quickly. \n\nFood was amazing! Definitely a little on the pricier side but well worth the extra bucks. Again, flavors unique to their location which is refreshing when a lot of restaurant food is so redundant. \n\nHighly recommend if you have a few extra bucks and a good amount of time to spend!","2256":"We loved the Parish! My boyfriend got the catfish, and it was incredible! It was a huge piece of catfish, and it was SO tasty and flavorful. I ordered the roasted butternut squash salad with crispy pork belly. BEST pork belly I've ever had. I was blown away by this salad. We got the Abita Amber and Weapon Check beers to drink. We both agreed that the Weapon Check was the better of the two. It was nice that we got to hop in line on Yelp prior to arriving at the restaurant. We arrived and were seated in 10 minutes on a Friday night, so we were pleased with that. They have indoor and outdoor seating, and they took some Covid precautions.","2257":"AMAZING!!!! Every dish was fabulous!! I looooved the popovers!!!This was one of the best meals I have ever had! Staff is nice and friendly. They go out of their way to help and serve you. The food is absolutely fantastic. The menu is very select, so if your a picky eater this may not be the place for you!","2258":"Came in recently with 4 people. They sat us, rushed us through ordering. First they served us our appetizers. Some people at our table ordered frog legs and they were completely raw in the inside. Ruined the rest of their meal biting into raw frog legs. Then we got our main dishes. My husband got the catfish and it was ok, he said nothing special. I got the salad with pork belly and it was tasty just so spicy (I love spicy and this was a lot) I had to really take my time AND you have a 2 hour limit to eat there as stated on their tables. So we weren't even closed to finished with our meal when they started clearing things from our table. Overall a really bummer experience because we were all really looking forward to it. Will not be returning and for sure not worth the hype.","2259":"Definitely a Tucson favorite, service is always great. My top favorite menu items are the Shrimp and Grits and the Drunken Angel. I also miss their brunch menu with all my heart.","2260":"Before going to The Parish, I was really excited about it.  It sounded awesome and people had good things to say.  My coworker\/friend and I had been talking about going for happy hour for months before it finally happened.  We invited another coworker\/friend and checked it out.\n\nMy first impression of the interior was positive.  I posted a couple of photos I took of some nice decorative features.  But as we sat there and I looked around, I noticed that the lovely, artsy decor was accompanied by some truly tastless pieces, such as the sculpture of a butt with a smiley face on it.  Seriously?  Tacky, Parish, tacky!  That was not the only weaksauce piece, just the worst that I could see from my seat.\n\nI had called ahead to ask if they had gluten free options and the guy that answered the phone was very enthusiastic that they did.  When I asked the server if there was gluten free menu or if she could tell me what on the menu was gluten free, she told me I could have a burger without a bun or one of the salads, and maybe the salmon but she wasn't 100% sure.  As I eat 98% vegetarian, too, this left me few options.  \n\nI ended up choosing to let it be part of my 2% and go with a burger, though I honestly didn't feel like it.  There just wasn't a reasonable other option.  I got the Parish burger without the bun, and it was... OK.  I asked for it medium rare and it was definitely rare.  My companions, who both eat meat and gluten no problem, also found the food menu a bit limited.  For a \"gastro pub\", the menu was not nearly as cool as it should have been.\n\nWe also each had cocktails, which were tasty.  The happy hour specials, though, were not very good for saving us money.  The service was very friendly, but very inattentive.  The fact that our server didn't know and didn't seem to be willing to find out if the salad she thought might be gluten free actually was did not impress me.  The cocktails and my company were the best part, but there are cocktails as good or better at better prices elsewhere, and my company didn't much love the place either...  So, sorry Parish, but I doubt I'll be back.","2261":"This restaurant never disappoints! The food is always spot on and you can never really go wrong. I ALWAYS need at minimum one (but usually get 2) orders of the hush puppies. The atmosphere is very relaxing and I never feel rushed. It's decorated beautifully and always very appealing to look at. Even if you order to go, you won't (or least I haven't) be disappointed. Highly recommend!!!","2262":"It was good frog legs were tasty trout fish was simple but good small but good beer tap selection.","2263":"I have GERD and I am lactose but I still wanted to try this place and I am SO GLAD that we did!! The vibes were dope!! The drinks we had were amazing. The waiter recommended them. I had some type of peach and whiskey? SO GOOD!\nI also really love cornbread and the corn bread (blue corn meal) was light and sweet and the butter was so tasty!\nI had the po boy catfish sandwich. HUGE SERVING!! It was served with a salad and I added shrimp. I think next time I would get the shrimp instead of the catfish. I wasn't a fan of catfish and I was hoping that maybe if I try catfish again that it would taste better but it tasted alright. However if you love catfish GET IT! \nI will definitely be back to try more of the menu and I'll bring a lactaid so I can consume the meals that have dairy.","2264":"Rats Restaurant is such a Gem in the Mercer County area. The restaurant is tucked away with amazing sculptures surrounding the grounds. \n\nThe restaurant has antique furniture throughout and they also offer outside dining when the weather permits.\n\nThe staff and servers were very friendly and attentive. All of the staff did very well with social distancing.\n\nI went for brunch, I only ordered a salad which was ok. I will go back and order other things from the menu to give a full review of the food.","2265":"Awesome food. Shrimp and grits w collards is especially good. They are super easy to pick up from under COVID-- if you call your order in and don't need a receipt, you don't need to touch anything, staff are defended from customers by good spacing, and if you need to use a pen there are separate jars for \"clean pens\" and \"used pens\". 15 mins from midtown Tucson, so it'll be ready when you arrive. The interior looks inviting-- look forward to dining in some day.","2266":"Went once. Wasn't impressed. Seriously overrated food if you're going off of reviews.","2267":"Awesome food, attentive service, fun craft cocktails....respectful space secondary to COVID with staff wearing masks. Very excited to see a local business thrive....","2268":"We went here for Easter Brunch. They asked if we wanted coffee tea or cappuccino and left the drink menu. We ordered 2 cappuccinos and was very upset when we received the bill to see that they charged $6 for each one. It was not listed in the drink menu so I assumed it was included. It appeared the waitress was pushing the cappuccinos. I should have been told that they were extra! Also the Easter lamb was raw and we were told to come back in a little while that they were bringing another one out. The food selection was good.","2269":"The Parish has a great reputation, but twice it hasn't lived up to the hype. Souther edamame and jambalaya had very good Cajun flavor. The shrimp po-boy was flavorless: bland, cornmeal covered shrimp. The burgers were burnt and poor cuts of beef. The Parish is a miss for anything except jambalaya.","2270":"Wow this place is expensive! I was in this store for probably 15 minutes looking for something but the only staff member was on a personal call and barely acknowledged me. Instead I found what I wanted on Amazon and paid half the price.","2271":"First off, the service was super friendly and fast.  The decor is dark and mysterious... gives you that mystic Mardi Gras vibe. Now I'm no Mardi Gras expert. But I was there with my best friend who's from Mobile, AL - Home of the original Mardi Gras parade. So she knows, loves, and is a local expert of Southern Cajun food. I'm an ALABAMA native so I know southern but no expert on Cajun. With this said... let's begin with the food.\n\nLet's begin with the good...\nHad the bacon fried popcorn. I don't eat pork. But this was like eating bacon without eating bacon. It was good! Popcorn fried in bacon grease is an interesting concept and it works. My bestie had hush puppies that came with her meal. They were outstanding! Wow!\n\nNow for the disappointment... I had the Mississippi Catfish. It was beautiful. Perfectly fried golden brown. The flavor however was missing. I added hot sauce. No help. Still tasteless. My best friend had the gumbo. She was not pleased with it at all. However... a gentleman praised the gumbo highly before he left. Bestie chose it, ate it, hated it. Paid and walked out and ran into a lady on the way out the door that also wanted to talk about just how good the gumbo is. \n\nLong story short... decide for yourself. \n\nWe won't be back. But if you like it, we love it.","2272":"What a great experience! I loved the theming and decor as soon as I walked in, and the menu selection was damn impressive. We got the cod, the smoked pasta, and the Brussels--all were perfectly seasoned and truly delicious. Service was great too. I'll be back for sure!","2273":"Fun atmosphere, cool decor, refreshing drinks and delicious food! We ordered the spicy edamame, oyster po boy and catfish poboy, it was all amazing. If you're looking for a refreshing drink try the El Verdad, it was a cucumber tequila with fresh lime juice and agave. It was SO good. Check it out!","2274":"Subpar kind of lunch, the rating is for the food which was good but nothing out of this world for the price. Can definitely go somewhere more simple for just as good of a taste. Limited selection on the menu but the nice part was the little walk through in the back with some statues and art pieces plus garden. Overall, nothing that had a wow factor for the prices they had like some reviews had said but it is also a time of COVID-19 so their menu probably isn't the best at the time.","2275":"Love this little store so much. The owners are the sweetest and have always helped me find the most unique and local gifts. (I'm not a good gift picker-outer no matter how hard I try).\nSupport your local Reno businesses!!!","2276":"The food is great, the drinks are good but the service is absolutely horrible. I have been a customer around 10 times and i have been horribly disappointed each time. Even when sitting at the bar, we are ignored and i feel I am being a pain asking for something. When we had the \"V.I.P.\" table, we got our food and no one returned for 25-30 minutes. Every single time I have been there I would have gotten another drink if someone actually came to check on us, but no one does. Customers are treated like they are a nuisance. If it's worth the good food, I'm not sure...","2277":"Wonderful. I went to a Saturday lunch here recently and it was perfect. I had the shrimp and grits and an appetizer of frog legs.  The grits were delicious and the shrimp was tender and tasty but the real star was the collard greens. They were perfectly cooked, just as good as my mother's. I will definitely come back to try out more on the menu.","2278":"Great service and atmosphere! Got the bacon popcorn and it was fantastic. They also have a great variety of drinks.","2279":"You put semi-casual restaurant in a beautiful setting and everyone automatically believes its great. Yea, okay.\n\nCame here to celebrate my parents' wedding anniversary. I made reservations for this place about three weeks in advanced. So when we got there, of course we were seated right away, tucked in a nice corner near a patio door. Okay we're good.\n\nNext comes the waiter and takes our drink orders. We order a pitcher of white sangria to start off. The pitcher comes and this thing looked like the fruits were given to a 10-year old  to cut. They honeydew and apples in the pitcher were huge. Our server as he should, pours all of us a glass. But before he can poor the second glass, he spills the sangria on my nicely dressed mother. \n\nWe give this cat our orders and they come to us in reasonable time. The dishes were just okay. My boyfriend ordered the SCALLOPS, my brother and mother order the STEAK, the father the FISH and I order the MOULE FRITES. In concept this place is french influenced so i had to check out the moule frites. Simply okay. The scallops however were just scallops on a bed of greens. For a dish around $30 you would expect something more than just okay scallops on a bed of vegetables. No pasta, no potato, no grain to pair it. \n\nAfter finishing our entrees, THE FIRE ALARM GOES OFF. The whole restaurant is forced to exit to the back patio of the restaurant. 20 minutes later, we were told to come back in. NOTHING from management say how sorry they were, and what the whole alarm was about.\n\nWe ordered dessert and that was that. Nothing special there either. Our petit fours looked like they came from Godiva.\n\nI felt like I was in a movie the whole time we were there. A comedy of errors.","2280":"Definitely a chick place! It seemed like the drinks, food, and ambiance is geared towards women. My steak was good but it came with a giant pile of French fries but guys, if you're looking for a nice date night this is the place.","2281":"The Parish is a complete Foodoo gem. Like if Bourbon St. in New Orleans somehow intersected with 4th Ave in Tucson, but with a cleaner, fresher perspective on culinary creativity and upbeat service. \n\nBehind the bar, a gorgeous array of house-made flavor infusions form the foundation of dozens of delicious cocktails. And the liquor selections include lots of labels that aren't typically found on the north end of town. \n\nThe happy-hour menu knocks a couple bucks off some of the daily noshes. It's a little carb heavy. So I hope they expand in the future with some lighter choices. But with $3 drafts and $2 off most other drinks, it's a great way to open up the evening. \n\nPro Tip - Be sure to check out any of the Parish Label fermented *hot* sauces available upon request. I tried:\n\n(1) \"The Black Death\" with ghost pepper, pasilla negro, and \"brutal music\".\n\n(2) \"It's a Dry Heat\" with nopales, poblano, chillepin and \"desert life\".\n\n(3) \"Basic Bitch\" with pumpkin, habanero and coffee. \n\nSo good! \n\nThe Gumbo ($5 @ Happy Hour) is delicious. The Andouille sausage imparts a deep smokiness along with a slow and subtle heat. The rice on top is well seasoned and balances out the rich flavor. \n\nThe Beer Battered Mississippi Catfish ($15) is served on a bed of house-made fries. The batter is phenomenal: crisp, flavorful and not too greasy. The fish itself has a mild catfish flavor, but trends a little in the direction of mushy. So there may be too much moisture in the fish before it hits the oil. But overall, delicious. \n\nThe vibe at the Parish is lively and it can get busy on just about any night. So come early for a quick seat and prepare to hear every word of your neighbor's conversations. COVID precautions are in place, including sanitizing each table after every guest. \n\nWe'll definitely be back to the Parish on the regular. Can't wait until next time.","2282":"Arriving into Tucson...hot, hungry, with dog in tow.  I found a gold mine in Az.!   Homemade pork skins.  (A Keto' s  dream).  The best burger East of California, incredible gumbo and s'more cheesecake to top it off.  Did I forget  to mention the large selection of tap beers?  PS they took special care of my pooch, immediately replenishing him with tons of H2O.","2283":"It's me again. Ordeted in from DoorDash. Got the Angel Pasta, vegetarian dish. I'm NOT vegetarian, so I added shrimp.\nIt's hard to be surprised by a pasta dish. BUT! WOW! The flavors in this dish play off of each other and build upon each other, so that you never want the mesl ti end! Happy, happy customer! AND as always, the frogs legs were fabulous!!!","2284":"The place is decorated beautifully enough to hold a wedding reception. Very romantic! However  the food is average. I had the steak frite and my boyfriend had the chicken. Apps were tasty - deviled eggs and crab cakes. The service was non-existent as we couldn't reserve a table (they said were booked tho I saw many unused tables during our time there) . So we sat at a hi-top on the side of the bar where we had to get our own drinks, silverware & plates. The hi top table and chairs are very uncomfortable if your under 5'10\".  One busser was attentive at collecting our used plates. We tipped him separately. Strangely , our menu and the prices were the same as the waitress-serviced tables. All this to say, don't go unless you have a ressie on OpenTable for an actual table & chairs. PS - chocolate dessert was good. Drinks were good ( I had a frozen strawberry vodka drink & aperol spritz & coffee) . Bread wasn't served - Boyfriend had to flag down a busser for some.","2285":"Went there for the first time the other night. Had a reservation but was able to be seated right away as a walk in. First impression was a bit odd since the hostess was disinterested at best. Since this is a customers first contact\/impression of a restaurant, usually your most friendly, out-going and personable person is in this position. I've had better interation with a cactus. That being said, it was all fantastic after that. \n\nThe decor is eclectic and comfortable. You can kind of imagine a spot just off Bourbon Street. Our server Michael was excellent. Attentive and helpful in selecting our drinks and entrees. We had the cooked oysters and they were the best we have ever eaten. Good thing since they were $4.00 each!\n\nThe specialty drinks were also very good. My favorite was the Caribbean Mule. Good thing since they were $9.00 each. My wife had fish and chips and I had the double pork rib. One, if not the best, bone-in pork I have ever had. Sitting on a bed of pureed parsnips and a dill sauerkraut on top. Mind-blowing good! All I left were two slim bones. \n\nIn summary, once you're seated it is a good time, good food, good drinks, good service, and good value. $100 out the door and we got our money's worth. Can't wait to go back and try something else (and yes I'll get some more oysters).","2286":"Love this place.  We had Goat Cheese Relleno, Mussels, Grilled Petite N.Y. Steak salad and all were absolutely amazing. My favorite bartender Chris makes the most amazing cocktails! Please get over to this amazing place and try anything on the menu I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","2287":"We booked our daughter' s wedding rehearsal dinner at Rats and it was fabulous! The menu selections ran to 28 pages, all were interesting. While we were concerned that the execution could not meet the descriptions, the quality and preparation were exceptional. The butler passed hors d'oeuvres were superb...the crab cakes and crusted aioli shrimp...the entrees were perfect and the chocolate cake the best I have ever had!! Kudos to Rats. Lastly, the setting was uniquely enjoyable from the outside terrace sculpture to the lodge like private dining room.","2288":"Great dinner spot! We got on the waitlist and the table was ready by the time we got there. Kids loved the hot dog and fries, but mostly the oranges (go figure). We got the gumbo with shrimp and the butternut squash salad. Great cocktails too! But do NOT pass on the bacon popcorn. I'm pretty sure I'll be dreaming about that for a long time! It was seriously addicting!!!!","2289":"Pluses: the food was delicious and the staff were polite and friendly. They had a reasonable variety on the menu. They did have several burgers for those who want something familiar. I liked that they had a fair number of menu items that you don't see very often in Tucson. I ordered something I'd never heard of and was not disappointed. \nMinuses: we were at our table for an hour before the food arrived. Don't plan on eating here on your lunch break!","2290":"This place gave off New Orleans vibe for sure. Although I have never been the menu sounded very southern to me. We got the edamame and the popcorn bacon appetizer as well as the drunken angel pasta and the parish burger. The pasta was rich was creamy....my mouth is watering thinking about the leftovers I have. The parish burger was a thick ass burger which I LOVE. Seriously can't go wrong with a good burg. This place is defiantly a must try.","2291":"My wonderful Yelp Elite friend, Paige A. suggested this place for lunch. We came here with our SOs. I knew this place sounded familiar and realized that the chef was on one or more Food Network shows! I love watching Food Network so that's pretty awesome.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant gives a fancy, but also casual vibe. I am in love with the pink walls and light fixtures! I am also amazed at the huge selection at the bar and will definitely be coming back to try out some of their alcohol.\n\nFor our appetizer, we ordered the Frog Legs. The description of the frog legs is spot-on: The frog legs were seasoned with black pepper and came with a horseradish dipping sauce. Super flavorful and to me, frog legs taste like chicken. The dish came with four frog legs and rested on a bed of purple cabbage.\n\nI ordered the Drunken Angel Pasta and my SO ordered the gumbo for lunch.\n\nThe Drunken Angel Pasta came in a rich lobster broth with a ton of seafood, including crawfish. The pasta was angel hair that was purple (maybe from the saffron?) and came with two slices of broth. This was an AMAZiNG flavorful and rich dish, but I'd suggest sharing this with someone else since it's extremely rich and very filling for one person to eat.\n\nThe Gumbo came with a side of crawfish hushpuppies that is extremely satisfying. The Gumbo was good butI would even say that their hushpuppies are to die for. They are sweet but also flavorful and not dry!","2292":"The service and ambience of the restaurant was amazing!! \n\nWe got the Johnny's steak and frites which was delicious! We also got the Smokin Angel which I was suuuuperr excited for. On first bite it's a knockout bc it's super flavorful. But after a few more, it tastes really heavy and was hard for me to eat all in one sitting. That's just my personal opinion though maybe it's my taste buds but I think this restaurant is awesome and would definitely come back!","2293":"This place fucking rocks. Being up here in rich whitey land it's a little out of my regular stomping grounds but we were glad we made the trip north. Cajun style food is something easy to fuck up it you don't know what you are doing but these guys clearly know what they are doing. Everything we had was super tasty and nothing heavy(the downfall of Cajun food outside of Louisiana) lots of good spice and flavor and nothing overdone - the pork rinds, gumbo, and the pork chop were all amazing. Bring your appetite, nothing small or skimpy about the servings here. Beyond that they have great art and my favorite bourbon on the shelves. Alyssa and Alexis were both amazing, I don't know what it is about the heavily tattooed girls in the service industry that makes them the best and most conscientious servers and bartenders in the world but it seems to have become a reoccurring theme in the restaurant world. You'd be missing out if you don't try this place. Full disclosure, the owners are friends of mine.","2294":"Terrible service. The hostess was extremely rude and our party of 9 ended up walking out.","2295":"I love this place. I'm a fan of fish and chips. Their catfish is delicious. \nI'm also a big fan of the frog legs. Spicy, sweet, cooked to perfection. I hadn't had them since my ladt trip to the south. \nGive this place a try, for an out of the ordinary culinary experience.","2296":"Great selection of Cajun fare, awesome live music and friendly staff.  Cocktail selection is as good as the food.","2297":"Will never come back ever to try this place out. Walked in after calling to make a reservation and they don't take them, And promptly they told us they will not seat us and  we could not eat there. Two hours until they close and they will not seat us? Never again!","2298":"We had an incredible time here. Our waitress was Cassandra and she was lovely! I had the branzino and the \"Sunset at Monet Bridge\" cocktail for lunch. The restaurant is a mini museum in and of itself, and I'd recommend taking a nice look around you while you walk to your table! The decor is so meticulously chosen, and really worth taking a second to appreciate. \n       Rats is appropriate for all occasions, whether it's a quick bite before exploring Grounds for Sculpture, a fancy anniversary dinner, an afternoon catching up with an old friend, or a drink at the bar after a long day spent walking around the Grounds.\n     I can't recommend Rats enough. There's a sense of unique joy there, and it's also reflected through the menu!","2299":"Amazing dinner will be returning for sure tried the pineapple mojito waitress made it with rum... absolutely refreshing","2300":"This place is so completely unique in the best way possible. The flavors they have are vibrant and just too good. The bacon popcorn is a must have and the shrimp and grits are to die for!!!","2301":"Overpriced fake French food\n I ordered Roasted Cauliflower and french fries because they were the only decent vegan options other than a bib lettuce salad. The other option was a cauliflower steak with farro, roasted carrots and some sort of sauce.\nI decided to order two sides, roasted cauliflower, and french fries. The order came and I was given the cauliflower steak with the farro carrots and some sort of nasty sauce. It was absolutely wretched. I ate one-quarter of the cauliflower and could not have anymore.  I had the two baby carrots and the fries. The fries were over salted and tasted like frozen fries. Not wanting to make a scene I did not say anything but the lunch was awful. The lemonade was super sweet ad tasted like it was a mix. I would not recommend this restaurant. the prices are outrageous. $18 for a crummy slice of cauliflower, two small carrots and a spoonful of farro with a sprinkling of some sort of odd-tasting \"French\" sauce. I will not be coming back.","2302":"Truly serene.  The food is great and the scene is like a painting.  Our waiter Scott was a lot of fun and we had a fun visit from a duck from the pond.","2303":"We got into town on Monday evening and our hosts recommended The Parish.  This place was a great way to unwind after driving 8 hours.  We started with the bacon popcorn (beyond sinful) and the blue corn bead.  Both were great!  The blue corn bread was just the right amount of sweet ...not too much, not overly sweet.  We probably could have split a dinner since the appetizers were so large.  We ordered the burger and gumbo.  One of the best burgers Ive had in a long time. ... seriously juicy and full of flavor!  Tried weapons check irish red from the local brewery ...yum!  Cant get this one at home so stopped by the 1912 brewery and picked up a couple of growlers on Wed.   Rachel was a great server.  Will be back again when in town!  Might even stop in one more time before heading home.  Thank you to the folks here for the great welcome to Tucson.","2304":"Update \nCame for a much needed mommy's night out. Tried a different dish than last time and it was excellent! Service was great and price was reasonable. Will try again because I would like to make this one of my favs.\n\n1 Star-   Total failure of an experience based on this experience would not return. Would not recommend.\n\n2 Star-  Below average on several levels, not a total failure. Wouldn't seek out to return or recommend.\n\n3 Star-  Average experience, minimum expectations met. Nothing that says wow or that stands out. Would return if someone else wanted to come, not a regular go to.\n\n4 Star-  Above average experience, will come here again and recommend to friends and family.\n\n5 Star-  This will be a regular go to and will be highly recommended to people I know. Exceeds expectations on a consistent basis.","2305":"I told someone that I was excited to try Sunday Brunch at Rat's Restaurant and she said \"I don't think I would go to a place called Rat's.\" That comment took me aback as I think it's a cute name, and besides, Rat's has an excellent reputation as an upscale restaurant. It's been on my radar for a few years and this past Sunday I finally went. \n\nIt was great in every way!  We made reservation for noon and I am glad we did, because we overheard people without reservations being turned away. We were given the choice to sit outside or inside, and choose outside. I think we had the best table, right next to the pond. The view was magical! (Please see photo). \n\nMy friend got the Froz\u00e9 Rose ($12) to drink and I got a Peach Bellini ($10). Both drinks were on point!  She ordered the frittata ($16) and I had the Rat's Burger and fries ($19), both delicious! We finished off with cappuccino ($6). Everything was presented beautifully, too. \n\nOur servers were all attentive but not intrusive. The whole atmosphere felt refined and relaxed at the same time. Some ducks waddled out of the pond and nibbled on my friends pocketbook strap, and then let me pet them. I love ducks and thought that was adorable. \n\nThe restaurant is at the entrance to Grounds For Sculpture but you can eat there without going into the Grounds.","2306":"Terrible service\nRidiculously long drawn out meal\nCondescending waiter\nOverpriced and mediocre food\nCool decor is about all this place has going for it \nBest avoided","2307":"Overpriced, greasy food, overstated flavors, and service that will ignore you entirely. Will not return.","2308":"Debi and Mimi are the two gorgeous co-owners, mother and daughter, that really know how to run a gorgeous boutique. I love that this shop is full of Nevada pride. There are so many unique and eclectic pieces such as kitchen and home goods\/items, towels, cookie mixes, chocolates, accessories (from jewelry, wallets, sunglasses, and watches), water bottles, t-shirts, hats, trailer hooks, ect. The list is endless. These items are great for presents, but are awesome buys for yourself! Mimi and Debi are both very proud of their store. They showed me around and gave me an explanation of all the wonderful locally handmade items that are made here in the Reno-Tahoe area. I loved the Nevada Oneloa hats. I definitely bought one for me and my boyfriend, Bryan. We wear them proudly to show off our Nevada pride. The selection is limited here, but Mimi posts her inventory on social media. If you like something don't be afraid to run in and grab it that day.  Happy shopping :)","2309":"Nice place.  Restaurant had a cool vibe, people having fun, and the food was very good.  Started with a White Wing beer off a well organized beer list and my wife enjoyed her wine.  Loved the hush puppies with the green onion sauce.  Then couldn't decide between the pork sandwich or the award winning burger.  Server said have to go with burger, so I did.  Good choice.  My wife loved her salmon salad.  We both had a terrific lunch.  Will return again for the pork.","2310":"This place was perfect!\n\nAttentive staff, quick service, and absolutely AMAZING FOOD AND DRINKS! \n\nI ordered the compressed watermelon salad. It had large cubes of perfectly cooked pork belly that was crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside! The dressing was a little spicy but it was balanced so well with the watermelon and goat cheese! \n\nMy boyfriend had the drunken angel. \"It was f***ing perfect\" in his words! I don't like shellfish but I tried a bite of pasta and it was really good!  \n\nIt had a bit of a wait but well worth it and worth every penny! \n\nDrinks:\nBlueberry thyme Ricky- a little strong with thyme but still good!\nGuero Canelo- AMAZING! Loved the cinnamon on top \nPrickly Pear Palmer- (na) soooooo good! Not too sweet but the perfect flavor for a Palmer!","2311":"Amazing food and service! We loved the Drunkin Angel and the burgers are huge! My nephew said it was the best burger he ever had.","2312":"We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at The Parish. Definitely the best gumbo I've had in Arizona. The additional crawdads were perfectly cooked. My husband had the oyster po' boy which he said was delicious. Our friends had burgers of an impressive size. The waitstaff were friendly and efficient. I'm looking forward to my next visit!","2313":"We had an excellent dinner and service from Jessie. I had the gumbo, my girlfriend had the Tschop both were excellent. We HAVE to go back because I realized the next morning I under tipped (sorry Jessie ).","2314":"Nice spot. Wife and I were in town and saw the menu. Frog legs were good put a little over seasoned. Signature burger was was great and not overcooked. Will return next time in town","2315":"Had the catfish which was under done, and gumbo which was luke warm. Otherwise the food was just ok.","2316":"This place is amazing. Get the Brussels sprout appetizer and try the po boy with a side of gumbo. Then go back and try everything else on the menu. The burger is one of the best you will ever have. The pasta is insane. The shrimp and grits is amazing.","2317":"As soon as you walk in you will feel the creole spirit in this place. The drinks are top shelf with there house infused drinks. The food was as good as any you will find in New Orleans.  I highly recommend you stop by take your time have a few drinks and enjoy everything they have to offer.","2318":"We stopped in this spot for a quick happy hour (weekday 4:30). My Paloma was good (with upgraded tequila) my husbands gin and tonic wasn't anything special. The happy hour specials weren't anything to write home about, over fried hushpuppies and steamed edamame with flakes of Tajine seasoning. \nWe give a three* because they gave us a better 2-top and the server offered to help with the broken strap on my mask.","2319":"The food is really just as good as the reviews! Our waitress was so helpful in helping us decide on our dishes since a lot of the items on the menu were very unique. We got the steak and fries, parish burger, gumbo\/hush puppies and the angel pasta. All were so incredibly delicious! One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the items shown in yelp reviews are either only offered during lunch (shrimp\/oyster po boys) or is no longer on the menu (fish and chips). Regardless, all of the dishes that are offered are so amazing, it's a must-try if you are debating whether or not to check it out!","2320":"The heaters outside still provide some warmth. The branzino was amazing, but this is definitely a place for someone with more upscale pallets. It's not a kid friendly place. But if you vibe with the menu it's all well executed","2321":"I came here on a Thursday night and was able to get a table without waiting or a reservation.\n\nI think the Parish is between a 3 star and a 4 star. However, I decided to give it a 3 star because of the service that I received that night. \n\nI ordered the Gumbo (happy hour menu), the cornbread, oysters, and the drunken angel (pasta). \n\nThe gumbo: it was average. Nothing too surprising. \n\nThe cornbread: probably my favorite dish the whole night. If I come back again in the future, I would definitely get this again. The cornbread was so soft and with just the right amount of sweetness. And of course, it came out on a skillet so it's very warm - nothing beats a warm cornbread. The only thing I would recommend is to have the butter come out separately. I did not like that they put the butter on top of the cornbread. \n\nThe fresh oysters: they were alright. The size of the oysters were decent. However, the oysters lacked taste. When I said they lacked tasted, I meant there was no taste. I felt like my tastebuds malfunctioned and I lost my sense of taste when I was eating these oysters. I reckon it's from excessive cleaning on the oysters. Avid oyster-eaters know - you shuck the oysters, rinse them real quick, then serve them. I also didn't like that they put the sauce in the oysters before the oysters even come out, because I'm one of those people that like the natural taste of oysters and do not like cocktail sauces on my oysters. \n\n\nThe Drunken Angel: I'm not a fan of angel hair so I should have asked them to switch out the angel hair for spaghetti (if they would allow it). I cannot comment on the burgundy angel hair (red wine angel hair), but I would comment on the sauce. They give you a decent amount of crawfish and 2-3 shrimps; the menu stated it should also has lobsters, but my dish didn't have any lobster meat. The sauce was decent and the toast bread that came with it was good. However, I would probably try something else next time. \n\nIn regards to the service that I received - I do not think that I received bad service (my water glass was filled promptly and the food came pretty quickly). However, the dining experience there made me feel very uncomfortable. I just felt like I was not welcomed there and that they just wanted to get me out of the restaurant as soon as possible. That's why I gave the 0.5 star deduction.","2322":"This is one of my hands down favorite restaurants. Everything I've had here has been phenomenal. I highly recommend eating here.  The gumbo is amazing, the catfish awesome. Staff is very attentive.","2323":"We enjoyed the Thanksgiving feast from The Parish immensely! Before Covid, we wanted to try this restaurant, and when we discovered their Thanksgiving offering, it was a great opportunity!  The food was flavorful, unique, while at the same time traditional. Outstanding!  The Parish will become a go-to place for us when dining out becomes possible!","2324":"Keeping it local and safe, we decided to try Rats for Restaurant week and were not disappointed. The Prix Fixe dinner was $45 with a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. You can also order off of the regular menu if you so desire.\n\nWe started with a First Course of Sauteed Shrimp for three of us (piperade, chorizo, Italian parsley and toasted breadcrumb) and Butternut Squash Soup for our other diner (pomegranate molasses and pepitas). Everything was excellent with the exception that all of our shrimp appetizers could have been hotter - lost that 5th star for this, should be a 4.5). Overall, the taste was terrific - just too cool.\n\nEntrees were split with Coq Au Vin for two diners (pommes puree, burgandy braised crimini and pearl onions, carrots and bacon lardon). Our other diners chose the Braised Short Rib (pommes puree, roasted baby vegetables and burgundy jus). All entrees were piping hot, delicious and nothing came home with us.\n\nDessert, as if we really needed dessert consisted of Creme Brulee and Chocolate Cremeux. Overall a very nice experience and our server, Rob, was excellent along with all the support staff.","2325":"One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. Came in from Phoenix for the weekend. Everything exceeded my expectations. Food was delicious. Service was attentive. Everything was reasonably priced. Will definitely be back.","2326":"This is truly a great find in and of itself. It is adjacent to the Grounds for Sculpture which is a fantastic place to visit. The restaurant is beautiful. The food and the service outstanding. The menu changes by the season. We shared the beet salad and both had the trout. They were flawless and presented beautifully. We have previously visited Rats and were pleased with all of the various dishes we ordered. Definitely a place to go for lunch or dinner with the special person. Remember to make reservations!","2327":"Why did the chicken cross the road? Because you didn't f***ing cook it! I ordered the Nashville hot chicken and it was pink and disgusting! The chicken was so raw it walked into my kitchen, laid a dozen of eggs and walked out!!!","2328":"This was a spontaneous stop for lunch that we \nSo enjoyed! Bacon popcorn drinks made with infused alcohol and wonderful gumbo, hush puppies, fries and pork sandwich. We will go back for dinner nex","2329":"Great food, everything on the menu is amazing, excellent cocktails, great atmosphere.\nOne of Tucson's must do's!","2330":"Stopped by here for lunch after wandering around Grounds For Sculpture.  Luckily, we were able to get seating outside to enjoy the beautiful day without a reservation.  I guess that's one of the benefits with visiting on a weekday.\n\nHighlights: \n- Ambiance, decor & scenery: Very classy looking restaurant inside and out.\n- Food: Very good.  Enjoyed a steak salad for lunch and mini cupcakes for dessert.  \n- Service: Our waiter was excellent.\n\nEhh:\n- Menu selections: Relatively limited for some reason.\n- Cost: A bit pricey, but you're paying for the experience more than anything.  That and the fact that it's the only restaurant in\/near the park.","2331":"Formerly known as Larkellen. Previously located on at 606 Plumb Lane. An adorable little Baby & Home store that is very easy to find. Parking is tight, but there is always plenty. \nEvery time I've visited, I always find the perfect little gift. Although those perfect little gifts are on the pricy side, it's nice knowing you're supporting a locally owned shop rather than a big box store. Shopping small is so important! \nTheir shelves of products are always changing up. There are always new items to shop. The items are never stale. \nThey tend to also carry lots of locally sourced and made items as well. \nThey will gift wrap your purchase if you like. I love that! \nA few times I stopped on my way to a get together and needed something in a rush. I love that I can walk out and it be packaged all cute and ready to go! \nMy only complaint are the hours. They tend to consistently change up. I highly recommend calling first to see when they will be closing for that day as I've driven over from Sparks around 5pm three times now and they've been random closed. Just call and double check before you waste your gas and time. Or even watch her stories on Instagram. I've learned she typically will post a story about if she staying late that day, or if they are deciding to close early.","2332":"So glad we found this place while visiting Tucson. Our service was awesome thanks to Lawson. The food was amazing. the staff were so professional over all, the ambiance was also good enough.\nI m planning to get there once again with my friends, they may also like this place, if they did then we should come here often here.","2333":"The staff is not very well trained. In a not so busy period of the day we had to wait for a while to receive our orders. When one of the waiters brought two bowls of French onion soup, no spoons came with it even though it was not the first time he came by to our table and we had nothing but forks and knives on it. We had to specifically ask for the spoons, because obviously it was above his pay grade to decide if a client needs one and had to wait a little more for the spoons to be actually brought to us. We ordered French onion soup and sea salad which were okay, but nothing special. The most frustrating thing was to find an additional small charge from them on top of what we owed according to the check they brought on my bank statement (yes, we left tips in cash). So, all in all, the place looks interesting, but their service and kitchen are okay at best and I wouldn't recommend it, especially since there are two more places you can grab a bite in the park.","2334":"The Parish was phenomenal.  We had Gumbo, hush puppies, and Brussels.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Don't pass this place up!","2335":"Really beautiful place.  Exceptionally beautiful.  That's it, the food was not special, and our order was wrong.  Pricey.  Our waiter was very attentive.  Did I say it was beautiful? Well there's that.  Lunch prices are what I would have expected at dinner.  Bring your camera.","2336":"More for the experience not the food. Forgot to ask for drinks, over priced d'Angelo's prime rib sandwich. Only reason why it's worth it is the statue trail. \n\nCrohns bathroom review: \nNice smelling bathroom with a nice playlist of soft music. Sink was fancy but school foam soap  7.5\/10","2337":"Can't say enough about this place! We went on a Saturday night, around 8 and were seated promptly. The place was lively, festive but not too loud. It was a little dark, but it totally went with the entire New Orleans vibe of the place. We decided to order the corn bread as an appetizer which came quickly and was delicious. A bit sweeter than I'd like, a bit more of a dessert but still very good. We ordered the gumbo and the drunken pasta I believe it's called. The gumbo was spicy and tasty, the only thing that sucked was that I wanted more! The drunken pasta was very good also but very very rich. All in all, I'd totally go back, as a matter of fact I can't wait to go back!","2338":"Drunken. Angel. Pasta. That's it. That's the whole review.  What's that? I have to write more? Screw you, Yelp I said all I wanted to say!\n\nOk so, the drunken Angel pasta is incredible and I've tried again and again to try something else when I go here but I always end up with this delicious, tangy, cravable masterpiece of a culinary creation. \n\nWith that said, the cast iron cornbread is perfectly yummy and I could eat it everyday. The burger is straight fire bruh and their cocktails are the shiznit.","2339":"The first sign should have been the rotting flowers in cloudy yellow water on the table. We ordered gumbo. This gumbo had what seemed to be split pea soup for a base and spice, lots of spice, no other flavor aside from some crispy sausage casings. Ate 3 bites and gave up. Asked the server for a receipt she said sure then proceeded to wait on other tables. Never again.","2340":"I came in a couple of weeks ago to treat myself for the new year, and let me tell you, it was worth it!\nMy waitress was Sarah, and she listened to all of my needs attentively. I can be a difficult guest at restaurants, I know, but she handled everything beautifully. On a busy night no doubt!\nThe food was fantastic, I got the Gumbo, per her recommendation after talking about what I can and can not eat. It was outstanding, I finished my dinner! That doesn't happen often.\nI will be coming back!","2341":"Just rolled into Tucson for the first time ever so this experience was literally the prelude to our visit. Food was good but not all NOLA cuisine needs to be spicy. FYI Butternut salad is spicy. It was good and I ate all of it but I was also hungry. Added 4 shrimp for $6. Good again but pricey. Overall it was an okay experience except for the really greasy\/slippery floor in the bar dining room and I would have given this place 4 stars until the waitress stayed in the kitchen a full 10 minutes when we were ready to cash out. Watched the hostess talk on her cell phone while clearing tables (at least it appeared to be hers when she put it in her back pocket)and also watched her go in and out of the kitchen and at one point every wait staff plus the bartender were all in the kitchen. Something interesting must have been in that kitchen. Had to flag down and ask the hostess on one of her trips thru the kitchen to get our check and she brought it back with no apology for the wait. Waitess then meandered out and pIcked up our CC to cash out and again no apology. But she asked if I wanted more water 10+ minutes too late when we were ready to leave. I said water to go would be great but thought better of it realizing she knew I was not happy. This is NOT how it's done in New Orleans or most places I've been in my home state of Louisiana but maybe that's how it's done in Tucson? Won't be back.","2342":"This is now a new favorite place for me, everything about it was fabulous from the decor and artwork on the walls from local artists, the cute bar and chandeliers, and intimate candlelit tables.  I saw what kind of place we were in the moment we walked up to the door, and one of the waiters smiled and waited to open the door for us, Thomas ended up being our waiter for night, and he was fantastic!  He took the time to explain the history and background of the drinks to us, reminding us that we were in a New Orleans style restaurant.  The chef came out and complimented us on our selections, and asked how everything was, and the food - omg the food!  I had the gumbo with hushpuppies, and it was soo amazing.  The hushpuppies were light and not overly battered, and the gumbo had nice sized chunks of andoullie sausage.  I tried my friends trout and collard greens, and it flavored so well - just perfect!  My husband is hard to please when it comes to burgers, and he had no complaints!  One of the best burgers he's had - it was the Parish burger.  I want to go back and try their worlds crispiest fish and chips, and some of the amazing sounding appetizers - it was hard to choose something because everything on the menu sounded good!  I also liked the fact that the menu was in big print, many times in a dark restaurant, I have a hard time reading the menu, but I had not problem!  I can't wait to run back to the Parish!","2343":"Went here for happy hour yesterday and found it to be quite nice - but only at happy hour prices. The bar area is quite nice as well as the dining room but their wine prices are grossly inflated. When are restaurants going to stop overcharging for wine? Good selection of beers on tap as well as bottled.\n\nOn the positive side, the munchies during happy hour were quite good and we enjoyed ourselves. The dinner menu looks good and we will have to try it but I may have to ignore all the negative comments in recent reviews.\n\nI hope someone from Rat's actually reads these reviews - they really need to do some damage control.\n\nFour stars - but only for the bar and happy hour.","2344":"The only regret about our dinner at The Parish the other night was that it took us so long to try it.  A group of 6 of us had some pre-party appetizers and drinks and everything was absolutely delicious!  To start we were brought a new dish of spicy jerk chicken stuffed in an empanada with a touch of cinnamon and topped with fried plantains which was followed by a goat cheese stuffed relleno, a lamb chorizo flatbread, crawfish hushpuppies and (maybe best of all) a 'bacon and eggs' plate.  The bacon and eggs was a large crispy piece of pork belly topped with a perfectly poached egg all on a white cheddar grit cake swirled with a spicy hollandaise sauce - WOW!  To top everything off we had the lovely Lesley as our server who never made us wait for anything and kept the food and drinks flowing.  On the cocktail side they make a tasty dirty martini with pickle infused vodka that's dangerously good. I will definitely be going back for dinner soon.","2345":"Came here the other night with a friend I'm from Seattle and she's from San Diego and it was easily the best food and cocktails I've had in a while. Service was awesome","2346":"It was ok. We got hush puppies, bacon covered frog legs, and the parish burger. The hush puppies were great honestly. The bacon frog were eh. The horseradish rub was horrible. And the bacon was over done. The burger was also ok. But the bacon on it was also over cooked and borderline burnt. It was just crumbling off. The rest of the burger was decent although the onion marmalade was overpowering at times. The service was exceptional and that's why I gave it 4 stars. If not I would've given it a 3 just for the food. Its not horrible but it certainly isn't great.","2347":"My husband and I were so excited to find this restaurant. We've been there three times now and I have loved every meal we have had there! The mixed drinks were awesome as well and they don't skimp on the booze!","2348":"I'd only be back for the drinks if at all. This is a tough review for me because I couldn't really eat much from the menu since I don't eat pork or shellfish. I was with a group of 6 and everyone raved about their food. One guy said the pork chop was the best he'd ever had.\n\nI had the fish and chips. While they were indeed the crispiest fish, they didn't sit well. The batter is quite heavy and thick and it was plated on a bed of fries, which became soggy. \n\nThey forgot to put in the fish and chip order for the two that chose it and made up for it with a free bread pudding. Most everyone liked it though I found it a bit too sweet...could have just been my bite.","2349":"We had an amazing birthday dinner in a beautiful private room. The food was incredible and so was our waiter, Lawson.  I'm not sure why my reservation request sent me to the website - where I was not able to  make a group reservation- but fortunately when I called back the hostess or whoever answered the call confirmed my reservation request. I also appreciated the confirmation sent by email. \nWe loved the French Quarter which unfortunately closed but the food at the Parish was excellent.  It was great to have an authentic,  delicious Cajun meal for our celebration!","2350":"My family has enjoyed a great meal, of primarily burgers. 2 of us ate the Parish Burger, and salad in place of fries. I know that the meat is not organic, which is what I would prefer, but it is premium beef [from what I was told] and the bacon is very thick and nicely cooked. The blue cheese is also very nice! I am not a fan of sweet items in my burger, but not a problem -- I've asked that the sweet onions be put on the side, separately. The same for the spicy mustard, which tastes good to me, but I only wanted a dab or two to enjoy it. Salad: It's not often that I compliment a salad, but the salad, here, is a beautiful mix of leafy greens, thinly sliced  cumber, tomatoes and some other items -- and is just delicious!  I am not a fan of the dressings that are offered, so for this to-go item I put my own EVOO & sea salt on it, at home  -- the best! A great night, for us!","2351":"Our visit to Rat's was solely based on Yelp reviews and after looking at the photos, especially the views, we decided to give it a try. It was a special occasion so we made a reservation just a day before and were lucky enough to get a table on a Friday evening!\n\nThe table was ready right on time. The place surely is fancy, you know like dressy crowd and a wine bottle on every table kind. The menu is pretty compact so it didn't take much time to decide what we wanted, french onion soup (ordered just because it seemed like a pretty hot seller), Black bass in a green curry with roasted egg plant, guinea chicken with some pistachio thing. The food overall was not something to rave about, but definitely was quality stuff, a little bland for our palate though!\n\nWhat was fascinating was the outdoor seating and the beautiful views, the indoor ambience was equally good too. While we were waiting for the food to arrive, we hesitantly (considering this was a classy place) took the liberty to go outside to click a few pictures, and there you go! A bunch of other diners were doing the same thing, so no shame after all ! :)\n\nFor an additional charge, you could enter the grounds to admire some sculptures. However even without entering the grounds, the restaurant seemed to own quite a bit of landscape to be explored, take a walk around the pond, watch golden fish, and stroll on the wooden bridge, full points if you were on a typical dinner date :)\n\nThe staff was very accommodating and courteous, and surely were on top of their game. Our evening ended on a high note, all thanks to the delicious dessert!\n\nTorta Barozzi (chocolate balsamic torte, mascarpone, chantilly, rosemary poached peaches)\n\nNo idea how in the world people think of these ingredients to create a dessert out of it, but it was simply delicious!\n\nHighly recommend Rat's for the overall experience!","2352":"had always wanted to try The Parish but had never managed to make it over there and then one day they donated a bunch of food to the hospital I was working at ( respiratory department) during the beginning of the pandemic and I was blown away. There was a bunch of different foods so I got to try a bunch of different things and WOW. The next week I was ordering to go from there for me and my daughter.This has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Tucson. I actually can't think of anywhere I'd rather go every time I think about going out to eat. The drunken angel dish is amazing and what I am stuck on at the moment. I also LOVE the pulled pork pibil thing they have going on. They have a really cool little bar with different infused alcohols. I come here at least once every couple weeks, very grateful to have this place to go eat at :)","2353":"Wait staff are incredibly courteous and professional. Excellent management. Definitely the most visually impressive restaurant that I've been fortunate enough to dine at in New Jersey. The complimentary bread is a nice touch and the house made herb butter is excellent. Great restaurant for a special event, romantic dinner, or a beautiful lunch. Particularly inviting when it's nice enough to dine outdoors. The burger, french dip, soups, and appetizers have all been excellent.","2354":"I've always been a fan of the Parish; I've been dining there on and off for years... their food, cocktails and overall eclectic ambience is something tucson natives and visitors alike, have come to know and love in general... \nI have to say though, they've really gone and blown me away over the last crazy year with the Covid-19 situation. The Parish was one of the first Tucson restaurants that I saw, really step in up when it came to keep business running while also maintaining safety. From touch less doors, to well unforced distance rules and many things in between, I never felt unsafe dining from The Parish! I love the Cajun\/French inspired menu and it's very clear they care about the community. Also, try the fresh pork rinds... but be fully prepared to never want to eat a packaged pork rind, again!","2355":"Adequate. Friendly staff that are very attentive to your needs. Food was average but perhaps I hit it on the wrong night.","2356":"Great spot to come with friends. The food was great and the atmosphere was very different from anything I've seen in Tucson yet! Which is awesome, we need more diversity! The drinks were also amazing.","2357":"You'll find The Parish in an indistinct strip center off of Oracle Rd. It seems to be  our first and only Southern fusion gastropub that's pleasing palates all over Tucson. The atmosphere is funky and the interior is somewhat mixed, but somehow it works. The drinks are creative and bold and pretty much EVERYTHING on the menu has a major kick to it. I think the peeps at The Parish are doing things right for sure. They have fun with the menu and with the flavors. This style of food, however, is not my personal favorite and not really something I could eat on a regular basis. The bacon popcorn is second to none. Holy bacon bits. It's delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. I've never had southern cuisine, so I have nothing to compare it to, but diners at our table, who have traveled to New Orleans many times, were pleased.","2358":"Just spent 8 hours on the road from Los Angeles I thought I'd order some food from 1 of the better food establishments in Tuscon....ordered food for 2....$110 bucks...Got back to hotel....No utensils...I called restaurant to inform them and got a im sorry...All good we ate with our hands...Taco Bell woulda been $30 bucks","2359":"Where do I start.  I don't give many bad reviews.  However, first, let me start with a positive.  Our waiter was polite and prompt (made sure to tip him pretty well).  So service was outstanding.  Now for the bad...\n\n1.  Seating Operations or Hostess:  First, I have to mention, we were 1 of 3 (3-4 person) parties in line, pretty empty restaurant, at 10:00am on a Sunday (Sunday brunch hours are 10:00am-3:00pm).  I would have factored in the part in that it's Father's Day weekend to give some slack but that's still not the excuse because again it was practically empty when we arrived.  Another VERY important fact was we had RESERVATIONS for 10:10am.  I'm not sure how this could go wrong.  I'm also not sure how we had reservations and were seated 25 minutes after the other 2 parties when we arrived just after and several other parties who had NO reservations.  That's extremely disappointing.\n\nTip:  Have 2 people as hostess.  One to record and watch the time for wait and the other to actually seat and inform the one recording or move to an automative program.  Yelp does this for several restaurants.  The poor girl up there was looking overwhelmed with only 3 parties in line. Bless her heart. \n\n2.  Food:  This was our first visit and we tend to be the type to go safe the first time because how can you mess up Chicken and Waffles?  All 3 of us ordered the Chicken and Waffles and as I took a bite I had to spit it out because it was ICE COLD on the inside.  A second round of chicken came out after I asked the waiter to stick his finger in the chicken that I didn't bite out of; he checked all our dishes and my son's was actually frozen on the inside.  Unfortunately, one of the breasts on my husband's plate was still cold from the second round of chicken.  By then we just let it go.\n\nTip 1: Also, I would look into using brioche bread for the kids French Toast.   Not sure if the adult version is also French Bread but you kind of lost the taste of the crispness of the egg yolk which otherwise on a brioche holds that consistency better.\n\nTip 2:  Fryer settings must be off and your oil is too hot.  It's burning up the outside but not fully cooking the inside.  Otherwise, the chicken is seasoned pretty well from the cooked parts I actually ate.\n\nI will say, the waffles, cornbread and Bloody Mary (w\/regular vodka) were pretty good.  \n\nI'm not sure what their lunch and dinner menus are like but I'm assuming the establishment does much better with those menus and are better fit for comfort foods and bar food.  This seemed pretty apparent because they seemed to have a decent drink menu.","2360":"I have been in Tucson for at least 12 years now and I have always heard of The Parish. All incredible things.\n\nMy family and I needed to grab lunch and my father is a sit-down-dining-experience kind of man. He's also from east Texas, close to Louisiana, and once I mentioned The Parish specialized in creole style food he was in.\n\nHe was very impressed on their hush puppies and their fried catfish.\n\nNow I'm usually wanting to eat on the healthier side and as much as all their salads sounded great, I couldn't shake my interest for their Drunken Angel pasta. It's on the pricier end but that's because it has saffron as well has crawfish AND shrimp. I got it and I have no regrets. It was a great portion and not so rich. I ate my whole bowl. \n\nI do admit I found some crawfish shells in my pasta that got stuck in-between my teeth. Yes, one can argue this could ruin the meal but that wasn't the case for me. This proved to me that this meal was so fresh they JUST got the meat from the crawfish. And honestly, I think it's understandable. I didn't mind. I told them the situation and they were very apologetic. They did care very much about my experience.\n\nAs a family with southern roots, we loved our experience and will gladly come back.\n\n(Order the hush puppies... )","2361":"Absolutely loved this place! My wife and I had just got into town for the jewelry expo and were starving. Yelp to the rescue! \nIt just so happens that it was Valentine's Day. The staff had decorated the place and had a special menu. The food was phenomenal and the service was great. The owner himself brought out our plates and talked with us for a while. \nWe'll be back next year to clean our plates once again.","2362":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for The Parish yet! Never had a bad time at the parish over the few times I've been. Staff is always warm and welcoming. I know this place has really grown a name for itself and it is definitely well deserved. All the food I've ever ordered has been fantastic and on the plus side they squeeze their own lemonade! I love lemonade. If I go out to eat I always ask about the lemonade. Some great things to try would be the fish and chips on the menu they are pretty tasty or the ruby red grilled trout is pretty awesome as well. Safe to say you can't go wrong. Keep up the great work guys!","2363":"While visiting family in Tucson, I had put together activities and places to go during my trip. One of those activities was to eat at a Tucson City of Gastronomy restaurant. We perused the list and found The Parish, which we had heard about through friends. The process for getting a table was a bit confusing, but we were finally seated at around 7:45pm on a Friday.\n\nWe ordered drinks and cornbread as an appetizer. The cornbread was AMAZING. And that butter....yum. \n\nFor main courses, we ordered shrimp and grits (with an upcharge of andouille sausage and crawfish) and gumbo (with an upcharge of shrimp). Everything was delicious, and such large servings for one meal! No one could finish in one sitting, so we got to go boxes.\n\nThe next morning, at the recommendation of our server, Chelsea, I finished my shrimp and grits by adding an egg to give it a breakfast twist. It was just as delicious as the previous night.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for a nice night out.","2364":"Fellow golfers were raving about the best pork chop, so we had to pay attention and try it out. My husband was so pleased, he wants to go back next week. I tried fish & chips--quite good even if fish portion was small.","2365":"I had a really nice Sunday lunch here with my parents. We all were very happy with our meal. Didn't sample a lot of the menu - just the salad (one of the best salads I've ever had) and the sea bass & salmon. Everything was delicious. Drinks were good, obviously expensive but I live in NYC and am used to that. And of course, the setting is beautiful - you have the option of dining outside right by the water. The name is somewhat offputting but who cares, I think rats are adorable and I was born in the year of the Rat! Check the place out for yourself and definitely visit the sculpture garden!","2366":"Always hearing about this place, but was put off from trying it after sampling a purple binned slider at Iron chef Tucson a couple years ago. We finally made it over, and they definitely changed my mind. The place has a European vibe inside, cool bar and awesome staff. The bacon popcorn is hard to stop eating, but so were the fries! I got a pulled pork sandwich and my husband got a shrimp po'boy. My husband asked for a sample of something on the menu and the kitchen obliged, so that was awesome. I do wish they had a few more options on the menu though. We would go back, but only for a few specific things that we crave, and not much my teenage kids would eat so more of a date night place.","2367":"8 Of us went to Rat's Restaurant yesterday for lunch to celebrate mt sisters 60'th birthday. We had an absolutely wonderful time, as we always do- It's about being together.... \nWe each ordered drinks, including some of Rat's signature cocktails and appetizers. Everything was quite nice, I personally loved my fennel & arugula salad with grilled shrimp. \nWe then ordered another round of drinks and our entrees, when the drinks arrived all of the empty glasses were not picked up off of our table that was already too small for the 8 of us. \nUnfortunately, when our entrees arrived our experience took a serious turn.\nOverall I was a bit surprised how un-special the entree's looked and one of the steaks we ordered was ice cold and everything else was room temperature! We sent the steak back and decided not to replace it, but just have it removed from the bill. When I got the bill it had not been removed nor had anything else been done to compensate for the disappointing experience.\nI spoke to the manager and had the steak removed, honestly she didn't seem to care to compensate and please us; she just disappeared.... \nIn the end we fun just being together but I would never go back to Rat's nor would I recommend it. \nPoor service, mediocre food, uncomfortable setting...","2368":"So the place is amazing but no one can cook.\nThe front desk peoples dress badly.\nWe have to waited 10 minutes for our table.\nNo flavor, cold food, terrible dessert .\nEscargot have no taste at all.\nThe sauce are a powder mixe.\nThe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was warm inside and so hard on top.\nThe potatoes was so oily.\nSo sad to see a place like this run this way.","2369":"We read about this restaurant on Yelp and really enjoyed it. The burger was very good with a little spice and juicy. We upgraded the side for gumbo and the gumbo was one of my favorites of any restaurant. Very meaty and a little spicy. Enjoyed the craft beers but they weren't my favorite of all time. Waitress was very good. Definitely will come back on our next trip to Tucson.","2370":"I've  had this reservation for well over a year. I heard all the hype about the stars. \n\nMy parents were taking us for a birthday celebration. The food was indelible. The two ladies at the table both ordered crab cakes. \n\nI have done quite a bit of fishing to date, the crab cakes smelled much worse than any bait I have deployed . I mean dirty like  bottom of the cooler smelly- six days offshore mixed with extra warm piss, tuna and Budweiser.\n\n I hope they don't get sick because they had a taste to be polite.  My wife brought  the fork to her mouth and gaged. Could not get it down. \n\nThey ended taking the crab cakes off the bill but the experience was horrible. Nothing is worse then going out to dinner with your family and having a shit time. They should have comped \nthe whole bill for serving such garbage at a restaurant. The entire evening was ruined because they left hungry and went to a connivence to curb it.  \n\nWhere is the manager???? They had one seafood dish on the menu and it was completely inedible. Why didn't the manger come out and say this is not OK? Steps of service? Quality! \n\nMy father and I had fair  meals, edible at least but it was overshadowed by the fish smell. \n\nThe bartenders acted like they came off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es . The kitchen is shit therefore your bar is shit. I wouldn't have served the  food they put out to a camping guest I hated. \n\nThe manger didn't come out to apologize either.  Who's running this dungeon? This place is a complete shit hole. \n\nCome for the art not the food. \n\nLet me be clear. THIS WAS THE MOST APATHETIC POORY RUN SHIT HOLE IVE BEEN TO. \n\nGood riddance.","2371":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for our anniversary looking for great food and ambiance. The venue is beautiful, especially the outdoor patio, with views of the little river and some sculptures. The food was okay. We had the mezze appetizer which was probably the highlight of the meal- the dips were great. However the pickled vegetables seemed to be out of a jar. I ordered the fettuccine pasta with pesto and I really couldn't get past the amount of oil on the plate, the pasta was doused in it. In addition, the flavors weren't very strong and there was very little tomato and corn. My boyfriend ordered the scallops, which tasted good, but there was quite a bit of sand that he had to constantly pick out while eating. We ordered the chocolate tart for dessert, which was great.","2372":"The vibe, the decor, the service, and the originality were great. Very good beer. Ok food. I would go again.","2373":"My wife and I ate lunch here today. I had the drunken angel and my wife had the pulled pork pibil and both we excellent. The prices were reasonable and our server was great. Great place to eat. Joe","2374":"A cute & casual place with a fun atmosphere, my husband and I enjoyed a lovely evening here!  The decor is eclectic - love the chandeliers!  The menu is diverse & unique, offering a good variety of tasty treats to try!  We started with cocktails while we perused the menu.  My Lemon Drop (Tito's, not too sweet, no sugar on the rim, came out perfect, exactly as I ordered it) & his Jack on the rocks was an excellent pour! After consulting with our waiter Lawson, we decided to each order a Garden District Salad & we would share the Drunken Angel pasta dish.  The salads were big with interesting additions like jicama & fresh herbs along with the tomatoes, cucumber & red onions.  However, the star of the show was the pasta!  OMGOODNESS, it is very rich & delicious!  The burgundy angel hair pasta is practically like drinking a smoky, burgundy wine, which is complimented by the lobster broth and saffron red pepper cream sauce.  That in itself would be a fabulous meal!  Top that off with the perfectly cooked shrimp and crawfish & it just gets even better!  I will mention that if you don't like wine, the dish may not be your best option...but we enjoy wine & soaked up every bit of that wonderful sauce!  The bread helped us to not miss a drop!  Service was excellent.  This was our second visit in the past few years & we will continue to pop in anytime we are in Tucson!","2375":"Came here for our anniversary dinner which the host acknowledged when we came in, but went otherwise unacknowledged by our server the rest of the night. Our server genuinely could not have cared less about our experience and was even making faces at us. Never had that happen before. Just rude. Had to ask for our water to be refilled, milk wasn't brought with coffee (we asked for it), missing utensils. When dessert came nothing was written on the plate nor did it have a candle. \n\nFood portions were small and uninspired. I think you really come here for the experience walking through the gardens...not the food.","2376":"Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. Was on the Yelp waitlist for about 40 minutes to be seated. Service was quick and easy.\n\nWe ordered a side of collard greens and corn bread for appetizers. The butter on the corn bread helped with the crumbliness of the corn bread, which wasn't as moist as I would have hoped. Collard greens were a bit too sour for me. Guedry's Gumbo was a bit too spicy for my boyfriend's taste. Drunken Angel pasta was super rich and tasty! My favorite dish of the night. I let came with ample shrimp and crawfish; I added the andouille sausage, which was worth it. Angel hair pasta itself was surprisingly good. Boyfriend also ordered The Doctor, which was an ok drink. \n\nOverall, great ambiance with quick service. Some dishes are definitely better than others. Highly recommend the Drunken Angel pasta. Other dishes are ok but I've had better.","2377":"My husband and I ate at The Parish a couple of times and had good experiences. However the last time, about 2 weeks ago, the food was so saturated in bacon grease we both got sick in the car on the way home. We will not be back. This is not due to COVID. It's due to careless cooking. Perhaps they are so busy working on their new restaurant that they have forgotten about maintaining quality and safety in this one.","2378":"I do believe I fell in love today!! My new food crush: The Parish...where have you been all my life?  I'm sad to see a couple of lack luster reviews because that wasn't my experience at all. My husband and I enjoyed the the atmosphere, the service and most certainly the food.\n\nThe atmosphere is adorable...girl speak, I know. But the bright colors, chandelier in the cozy cabana area and the obvious New Orleans theme is quite lovely and it really makes for a relaxing experience. \n\nWe were torn on what to get so we ordered a couple of things to share. I ordered the gumbo and hush puppies and the hubs ordered the fish and chips. I have not one bad thing to say about an of the food. The gumbo was perfect. Normally it will be over-spiced but this was done very well and coupled with the crispy, golden hush puppies, made for a warming meal on a windy afternoon.  My husband ordered the fish and chips which is one of my all-time favorite meals and so hard for me to resist. The fish was absolutely excellent. I was a bit surprised they chose to use Tilapia over Cod but it certainly didn't hurt the meal and the fries were to-die-for. One of these days I will have to make a list dedicated to french fries and The Parish will rank up there somewhere at the top!\n\nI forgot to mention that I also ordered a Bloody Mary that was done very well, with horseradish I might add! And their drink menu is quite impressive with their homemade infused liquors and very unique drink combinations. It looks like they're in the running for most excellent drink menu with some of the better mixology places in town!\n\nOur waitress was totally on top of things, very friendly and accommodating and was able to fill us in on upcoming events at the Parish including a big Mardi Gras fest! I do believe I will be there!! I honestly can't wait to go back and try more of their food. It's spectacular!","2379":"So glad we found this place.  The food was outstanding!  Brussel Sprouts were amazing.  Hush puppies were delicious.  Gumbo was the best.  My husband ate a burger and he loved it.  Thank you for the great service too!","2380":"Wonderful restaurant! The food was sooo good. Everyone loved their meal:) it did take a while for the food to come out, but the ambience, decor, service, and food were all top-notch! I will definitely be returning next time I'm in Tucson!!","2381":"I had heard amazing things about the parish. My husband being Louisiana native was excited to try. Well it's fusion so it isn't authentic cajun. The amount of food for the cost and lack of authenticity just makes this not worth it for me. \n\n\n1 Star-   Total failure of an experience based on this experience would not return. Would not recommend.\n\n2 Star-  Below average on several levels, not a total failure. Wouldn't seek out to return or recommend.\n\n3 Star-  Average experience, minimum expectations met. Nothing that says wow or that stands out. Would return if someone else wanted to come, not a regular go to.\n\n4 Star-  Above average experience, will come here again and recommend to friends and family.\n\n5 Star-  This will be a regular go to and will be highly recommended to people I know. Exceeds expectations on a consistent basis.","2382":"First time at parish heard a lot of good feedback. Out of town so cal friends picked on Friday pm . Busy but quickly seated , noisy but could talk , cool private room & bar area. Attentive animated energetic service team . Had frog legs app, tilapia fish & chips , good burger , and two famous highly recommended seafood pasta dishes called drunken angel ,Good looking bread w it too. Gumbo tasty , no deserts although sounded interesting just like the parish itself . I won't end with a \" kitchy \" quote. The blues bros came in bout 930 sounded good. Try it","2383":"This establishment is PURE CLASS... from Katie the waitress, to Nate the manager, and the PERFECTLY-STEAK-COOKING Chef, who went WAAAAY out of his way to satisfy my requests. Even when I insisted he didn't have to, he insisted and tried again... achieving what I was asking for. A Chef, who, not only has the guts to hear criticism, but who has the integrity to work to fix it is a rare find these days. PURE CLASS. In ALL Tucson, I'd be surprised to hear of any establishment beating The Parish in attention to detail, integrity of service, magnificence of product and attentiveness to the customer. And within a finely tuned atmosphere that is as relaxed as it professional. \nWe WILL be back... SOON.\nBilly Wilson.","2384":"Absolutely worth the wait!! Wonderful cocktails and unique menu!! Loved it!! Will be back!","2385":"Have been wanting to stop by here... Popped in on a Sunday evening much to my surprise Andy Hersey was performing!\nGreat drinks, wonderful food...\nI had chile rellenos filled with goat cheese and perfectly spicy edamame!\nThis place could only exist in Tucson. An incredible combination of Mexican and New Orleans cuisine.\nVegetarian items and gluten free items are noted.\nI had the Doctor for a beverage and enjoyed it immensely. Many other grand choices.\nHappy hour Monday through Friday 3 to 6 p.m.\nI can't wait to come back!","2386":"We went to this place on Christmas Eve, and it was probably the worst \"dining\" experience of our lives. In all honesty, the casual bars around here have better food at a fraction of the price with excellent service delivered by truly sincere people--they are your neighbors, and they see it that way.\n\nI'm not just talking about a server in the weeds, or something that was less than perfect. The server was rude, dismissive, he didn't ask us if we wanted dessert, skipped bread servings that are supposed to be highlights...I can't use the word I want to use to describe him. Terrible, not even trying to fake it...\n\nI grew up in my family's restaurant in this area and I'm no male Karen by any stretch....it was bad, trust me.\n\nRat's in an undeniably special space on some amazing grounds, and it is beautiful outside in the summer. But the way we were treated tonight will prevent us from returning, in spite of the conciliatory tone of the manager on our way out.\n\nJust close for the day if you don't have adequate, capable staff, it's understandable. Don't make the money at the expense of members of your community when you can't hold up your end of the bargain.","2387":"At here last week and it was outstanding! The food was delicious and the service was phenomenal! I recommend everyone to come here. The atmosphere is amazing the food was amazing and the service was amazing!","2388":"Excellent lunch.  Enjoying Grounds for Sculpture and had to visit Rat's for lunch.  Great service with Brian.  Got the charcuterie and cheese board - nice size and very tasty.  We had the heirloom tomato salad with burrata and also the foie gras toast as main meals and got a side of Brussels sprouts.  Everything was amazing.  Added a lemon  tart.","2389":"We dine out several times each month and enjoy trying places that are new to us. After dinner last evening, the Parish will be a repeat destination very soon. The ambiance is OK. The food was outstanding. The 4 of us ordered steak frittes, shrimp and grits, gumbo and the pulled pork sandwich. Every dish was a hit and we will return again soon.","2390":"Love it love it.  Always awesome spicy gumbo and hush puppies.  Can't pass up the catfish either.   Great bar dining or grab a table.","2391":"A very unique place, the inside is eclectic and very cozy and charming.  This is Louisiana food at its best.  The service was quite good and responsible.  We enjoyed the food very much, although some was a little Louisiana spicy.  Good eatings for cajun and Louisianan food.  We had Gumbo and it was exactly what you would expect, full bodied and a little spicy.  The catfish sandwich was delicious and HUGE.  A must try!","2392":"Cool place in strip mall nice cocktail list and beer list Black Maple Hill for 7$? Cool! Food wise the salad which was huge for $7 wow the roasted  garlic dressing was great I had the adobo pork sandwich which was off the hook Jim had the fish and chips and it was excellent for dessert the apple tart was great \nYou def must try this place it's great!!","2393":"(Note: written on take-out only experience during COVID-19 social distancing measures.) \n\nI went to The Parish years ago for a friend's birthday and remembered enjoying it a lot, and had been meaning to go back for ages. Obviously, the current shut-down of dining in at restaurants put a wrench in that plan, but last night I ordered take-out to treat my parents (one of whom is a hospital worker) to a socially-distant but delicious meal. \n\nI'm in what I've taken to calling \"quaranTREAT YO SELF\" mode, so I went all in on multiple appetizers along with my dinner. The Hushpuppies are perfect -- slightly sweet, buttery, balls of absolute happiness. The dipping sauce that comes with them is great as well and provides a slightly herbacious tang. The Black & Blue Brussels are delicious as well! The glaze on them is a lovely blend of sweet and subtly spicy, and the candied pecans provide little crunchy nuggets of additional sweetness. \n\nFor my entree, I got the Drunken Angel (angel hair with crawfish and shrimp in a saffron red pepper cream sauce). It's so rich and satisfying! I particularly enjoyed the way the flavors came together when sopping up the sauce with some garlic bread. My parents ordered the Smokin' Angel (angel hair with spinach, goat cheese, and garlic in a smoked tomato sauce) and the Shrimp & Grits (shrimp in Creole BBQ sauce on white cheddar grits with greens). Though I wasn't able to try their dishes, both enjoyed their meal a great deal. Both enthusiastically praised the bright, bold flavors and hearty portions. We all agreed that we'd love to dine in with them as soon as we're able! \n\nOn top of the great food, I really appreciate what they're doing to support the community during this time with discounts for a number of groups including healthcare workers, first responders, grocery-store workers, and more. They will definitely have my continued patronage!\n\n(Note #2: I don't have any photos because I didn't feel like a take-out container is a fair representation of how their dishes would usually look.)","2394":"Awesome location near the Grounds for Sculpture. We sat outside and had an awesome view of the water. They start you off with bread and scallion butter. We both ordered the watermelon kiwi punch. Definitely fresh.\n\nAlso both had the French onion soup. Soup itself was ok, but the cheese was fantastic.\n\nHusband got the burger. Asked for medium rare, but was more of a medium well. I tried one of his potato wedges, and they were crispy and well seasoned.\n\nI had the Prime Rib sandwich. Usually served with wedges, but I asked for the salad. Also very well seasoned.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate cremeux and creme brulee, and I also ordered the English Breakfast tea. Really good all around.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, but a little slow. We were there for about two hours.\n\nI would highly recommend this location if you're in the area or visiting the Grounds for Sculpture.","2395":"I got the garden salad because the hippie burger isn't vegan. Pretty great salad compared to most garden salads at other restaurants. The dressing was super flavorful. I really think they should consider making the burger completely vegan so everyone can enjoy it. Service was good as well.","2396":"First: Kelsey, our server, was exceptional. Thank you for thoughtful, prompt service. You were a delight. \n\nAppetizers tried: oysters (New Zealand, huge, sweet, meaty... ditch the barbecue sauce... it does nothing for these beauties), frog legs (favorite), bacon popcorn (very fun), mussels (the spice was a nice surprise), goat cheese relleno (creamy and a nice change from the usual)\n\nEntrees: Tchoup (the chop was oh-my-god sized and incredible), the drunken angel (nicely cooked seafood in a delicious sauce), trout (great portion), shrimp and grits (the collards shine and were *almost as good my own... mmkay, as good). \n\nDesserts: bread pudding (I wish I had more stomach to eat more), mole s'mores (what!?!?!  Did you really do that!?!?  Outstanding ::clap emoji::)\n\nThis is a lively place. The food was dressed up familiars from my home of Virginia. We will certainly be back to try more. Keep up the attention to detail. Happy to find this place as a new transplant to the area. Bravo.","2397":"This was my second time here. The first time I would have given it a 3. Unfortunately this time it has dropped to a 2. The ambiance is the best thing going. I started with the French Onion soup which was luke warm, the cheese board was not very well put together, pain sliced bread with 3 cheeses and a few nuts with a dash of raspberry jam. My sister ordered the chicken it was dry and flavorless. The good thing was the Braised beef with delicious pur\u00e9e potatoes, although it could have used a bit more gravy. For dessert we split the profiteroles which we ordered with coffee ice cream instead of the plain vanilla it came with . We were assured that this would not be a problem. Apparently it was. because it arrived with vanilla ice cream and not the coffee. There was one of the wait staff that gave us a few nasty looks when he realized we had not finished our meal. He made us feel like we were children being chastised by our Mom for not cleaning our plates. Will NOT be going back for a 3rd try.","2398":"Cool atmosphere!!! I love the art in here, had some great musicians playing. I ordered the gumbo and added shrimp it was pretty smokey but very good. I'll have to come back to try the shrimp and grits. Service is good and very quick, since I work in the industry I appreciated that.","2399":"On our families visit we checked out this place. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is the long wait to order. The staff was nice, but it took him a long time getting back with drinks and to take our order. He did great explaining the food and the specials. I had a spicy seafood pasta and it was amazing. The sauce was fabulous and great bread. Everyone else enjoyed their food except 3 in the group ordered gumbo, yet it had no sausage or chicken in it. We had to request meat to add to the gumbo. The atmosphere is very cozy and reminds me of home (the south). We will visit again.","2400":"My fellow foodie cousin came in from Phoenix. I wanted to take him someplace to show him the food scene in this town won't be runner-up to anywhere. The Parish turned out to be the perfect choice.\n\nThe vibe of the place is laid back. They have some house infusions and the drink menu looked to be pretty creative. They had a few nice craft beer choices on tap. There were not too many choices but I prefer quality over quantity. We both ordered the HopSlam from Bell's Brewing. Side note: They fill growlers, Had I known that I would have gotten one filled with this mighty tasty double IPA coming in at a whopping 10% ABV. But that's for another day...\n\nWe started with the Hot Legs Le'Jean (bacon wrapped frog legs). The simpleton in me picked one up, slathered on some of the tasty remoulade that came with it, proceeded to chomp away and hit bone. (Chiding myself: Of course frog legs have bones, stupid. Have you ever seen a boneless frog?). Proceeding more carefully, the frog legs were polished off and, yes, they do taste like chicken.\n\nMy cousin ordered the gumbo and I opted for the shrimp po' boy. My po' boy came to the table with a skewer sticking out the top holding a pickle spear in place... kind of a cool presentation. The  perfectly cooked shrimp were nestled on top of sliced tomatoes and shredded lettuce. The mayo was proportioned perfectly (although some of that remoulade that came with the frog legs may have made this review five stars) and the bread was sturdy enough to hold up but not so chewy that everything slid out when you took a bite. The bread itself had flavor. As a matter of fact, near the end of my sandwich, I ran out of shrimp and hardly noticed I was just eating bread, mayo, tomatoes and lettuce. My cousin did offer me a taste of his gumbo, but no way was I giving him a bite of my sandwich, so I declined. He did say the gumbo held up against any he has had.\n\nWhen my cousin overheard another table being offered King Cake for dessert, he immediately snapped to attention. He told me about a Cajun place in Phoenix that makes King Cake. We had to try the Parish's version - think cinnamon roll but not quite as sweet and a little richer. I have never had King Cake but I guess the Mardi Gras tradition is, if you find a baby in your slice of cake it's good luck. Not sure how finding a baby in your cake is good luck, but if you do, at least hope it doesn't have bones either.\n\nThis visit to The Parish introduced me to some new things. I am for sure headed back to explore the menu, try some craft cocktails and avoid anything with bones in it.","2401":"I have a hard time rating Parish because it's not my preferred style of cuisine. But I love their drinks, love the atmosphere, and my friends love the food. \n\nAs soon as you walk in, you feel like you're in New Orleans. It's got a dark, mystical ambience. I personally love the look and feel. They also often have live music to set the mood as well.  It's a smallish space. The last time I was there, I hosted a large party in the Main dining area. It did take up maybe 1\/4 of the restaurant.  They do have a parlor space that is separate from the main space, but it only accommodates up to 12. The management was very easy to work with to arrange a large reservation. Most of it can't be done online and via email which is great. \n\nLove the cocktails. Definitely has that southern classic vibe.  But they also have some inventive drinks as well. They have servers house made flavored liquors that I was too weenie to try. Maybe next time. I wish they had a gin fizz on their menu! That would really take me back to NOLA. Great old fashioned though. \n\nNow to the food.  I eat mostly plant based but do venture out a little when eating out. The salads can be made vegan\/vegetarian but there's really not much else. Even the popcorn has bacon. The food is pretty heavy, also not my thing. But this is real Southern food, which fits the theme so I can't complain much. Most of my carnivorous friends love this place. \n\nOverall, Parish is awesome. It's really our only Cajun place in town and they do the genre right. Personally, I don't enjoy the style of food, but I'll come again for drinks, the music, and the atmosphere.","2402":"Delicious and good service!!!!  The waitress is amazing bummed I forgot her name, the food is super yummy! I love it because it's not ordinary I had the best watermelon salad with goat cheese and pork belly so different, so so so delicious!!!!","2403":"A great meal and super service made The Parish an outstanding experience. My party of 2 got the catfish and gumbo entrees with bread pudding dessert. All 3 highly recommended! Beer battered catfish won the day, a GREAT departure from the normal cornbread-crusted catfish. Gumbo with shrimp was delicious and well balanced. Every one on the wait staff were hustled to make it a great experience. Definitely on the short list to visit again!","2404":"LOVE THEM!!! Mimi is the best & she is so kind. She always has great products & gifts that are all local made & support small businesses. Having a small business myself it really means a lot to keep things local.","2405":"This place has a nice atmosphere and food was good (but it was a bit too salty for my likings). If you have never tried Cajun food before, I would recommend you trying their food at least once!","2406":"Omg!! I was referred to this establishment by a local bartender at my hotel. When I tell you I was amazed with the food... man I was Amazed!! This is a Cajun inspired restaurant with very eclectic tastes. From the bacon wrapped frog legs to the pecan crusted Brussel sprouts, everything was an organism for the tastebuds! \nThe main dishes we tried was the angel pastas. One with shrimp another was vegan, but he equally delicious! I will be in the area for a few months and will definitely be back! The gumbo is next on my list!! \nGet Here Fast! You will not be disappointed! Expect a little bit of a wait as it's a popular hot spot with the locals and for GOOD reason!!","2407":"We had a (mostly) lovely evening. Just wish you had other vegan options Very expensive... \nMezze and dessert was lovely My friend enjoyed the scallops. The cauliflower was in exciting \n3.5 would be more accurate","2408":"The 3 star reviews are the honest ones. This place is truly middle of the road and it's not because the food isnt good, it's because the staff lags. I made a reservation  on Open table Sunday, showed up 10 minutes before the reservation time, and gave them my name for the reservation. After I'm seated, and while waiting about 20 minutes for a Bellini to arrive,  I get an email and lecture from Open Table saying the resturant has informed them I didn't keep the reservation. Absolute lie. Thirty minutes and still no drink but, look, we now have water for the table. Then, strangely enough, the waiter comes by with a bread basket, he selects two slivers of bread from the basket and places one on each of our soup plates... uhm what? What sort of resturant doesnt leave bread at the table  but hands it out like a soup kitchen?!. So at this point I'm embarrassed because I persuaded my friend from CA to come here. Finally, FINAlly,drinks arrive, and weirdly,  the waiter brings her coffee and bloody Mary at the same time, after leaving a giant bowl of sugar at the table for ten minutes. He then abruptly brings out her appetizer of soup...again, awkward.  She now has French onion soup, alcohol and coffee...oh! And no spoon to actually stir the coffee.  WE spent more time just sitting there waiting than actually eating.  I ordered the croque madam,  I was not impressed because it came out cold. I didnt send it back because I didnt want to get the spit special.  The macaroni gratin was actually  very good, and by contrast so hot it burned by tongue. My friend got the Rats Burger which while cooked to her requested temperature was again, warmish cold. I think they mistimed the food and let it just sit there while the macaroni cooked. Also, no offer to let us see a desert menu or digestif  (not that I would but still). Anyway, given all the resturants in driving distance  I wouldn't waste my time here again. You spend more time waiting, and no one seems to care that you're there. Really 2 and a half stars.","2409":"Tastefully done and superb restaurant! My fianc\u00e9 and I had a day at Ground for Sculpture and planned on doing an early dinner here and we are so glad we did. We started off with the saut\u00e9ed shrimp and winter greens salad (omergerd to the burrata in this!). Both got the short rib entree and split an order of russet potato wedges. What an incredible dining experience from start to finish! It was even better that we had the whole room to ourselves. This restaurant took every measure to follow CDC guidelines and our server was polite. Thank you, Rat's!","2410":"I have dined at Rat's numerous times over the years. Both the quality of the food and the service have slipped in the past several years.  It is very disappointing. The setting\/scenery is beautiful. It is tempting to go there after a walk through the Grounds for Sculpture, but the service is even worse as a \"walk in\".  The bar is crowded, the staff ignores you, and the tables in the bar area are dirty.","2411":"We were visiting from California and were recommended this place by local family. Started with drinks and hushpuppies - soooo good. The green onion dipping sauce set the hushpuppies off right! Our entrees were so good and tasted very fresh. This place is a must! The bread pudding was nearly gone before I could get a pic - couldn't set the spoon down!","2412":"Oh my, there really is no better place to eat in Tucson! The food is amazing, the drinks are excellent and the ambiance is great! \n\nThey have COVID safe seating outdoors with patio heaters if needed. Can hardly wait to go back inside one day. \n\nIf not comfortable eating there, pick it up and help support this business.","2413":"Truly a gem in Tucson. The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for a moody southern dinner. I had the hush puppies to start. The creamy garlic sauce they come with is delicious. I don't drink so I tried the cranberry mule and it was a ginger beer like no other. Perfect with the drunken angel pasta I got for dinner. Definitely a must try if you go there! Can't wait to try more of their menu.","2414":"The staff and waitresses was awesome! The ambiance of the restaurant was very welcoming and we loved the decorations. Food came out fast and our waitress was on the ball and took care of us. \n\nONLY BAD was our meals. I ordered their Parish burger. The burger was just unenjoyable. Some parts of the burger was just nasty, and some parts were too salty. Every bite was a different taste. \n\nMy wife had the drunken Angel and she complained of a weird after taste. \n\nFor the rest of the day my wife complained of stomach issues and myself didn't feel great. \n\nMaybe it was just a bad day.","2415":"Judging by the previous reviews, I was expecting this place to be amazing. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Maybe it was an off day for them? \n\nWe ordered the bacon popcorn, dirty martinis, crawfish hush puppies, and the chocolate cheesecake. The bacon popcorn was disgustingly salty. After a couple of bites I couldn't even touch it. The whole plate went to waste. The martini was also pretty bad. Undrinkable. The crawfish hush puppies were good though and the best part was the chocolate cheesecake. Absolutely divine! \n\nLike I mentioned, maybe they were having an off day with the bacon popcorn and the martinis because everyone else has great things to say about this place. I wish my experience had been better.","2416":"Sit in the bar!!! Amazing cocktails, friendly and happy bartenders! The twice fried fries were so yummy, special sauce was cajun or seasoned perfectly. Hubby had the gumbo, be sure to get the crawfish added! The wife had the drunken angel - incredible!! Amber and daughter nice job!","2417":"This place is silly good. Covid and all and they make it work. Outstanding food, service with a smile. Cold drinks. Show the place some luv and support, seafood gumbo is excellent!","2418":"We got takeout and weren't able to eat it right away. It got cold. Even being cold, even the French fries being soggy... it was some of the best food we have ever had. The steak & frites, shrimp and grits, and hush puppies were out of this world. The only problem I have is how I'm going to ever be able to eat there again without spending a ton of money because I want to try everything.","2419":"First time we went here was a pleasant surprise.  We got lucky as it was pretty busy after we sat down around 7pm.  The second time going across Arizona we decided to stop here again to make sure that our first time wasn't a fluke. So far we love every plate that we have ordered. The burger is amazing! Tried their grits and po-boy and it didn't disappoint. The po-boy catfish was perfectly fried. I ordered grits with French fries and the sauce was so robust that we kept dipping it with the fries. The atmosphere is lively and the decor is almost gothic jazzy feeling but fun.","2420":"The frog legs wrapped in bacon are to die for!  Everything on the menu is wonderful, and especially if you like Cajun or spicy.  I love The Parish!","2421":"For my money this is one of Tucson's best restaurants. Tonight I had the grilled trout and a side of gumbo. Both were fabulous. I also had a new draft they just added called Doberge chocolate cake from AbitaSprings, LA. They are presently the only place in Tucson that has it and at 8% alcohol it is rich, creamy with a touch of sweetness. Great Stout!. Our waiter was Lawson and he was wonderful. Be back soon.","2422":"Great food! Brussels sprouts were spicy and a little sweet, gumbo was authentic with the best hush puppies I've ever had!","2423":"I had a feeling I'd like this place, and there's nothing better than when a place exceeds expectations! \nThe Drunken Angel is just luscious and rich and spicy...ugh I can't wait to come back when the weather drops a bit! \nFun atmosphere, unique drink menu, and great draft list. \nWhy haven't you been?","2424":"After hearing about Rats for many years, I treated a friend to lunch there recently while visiting Grounds For Sculptures.\n\nOur less-than-perfect experience started out with a young man who greeted us and asked the hostess to seat \"these two young ladies.\" We are in no way young ladies and find this kind of comment very condescending.\n\nOur waiter was very welcoming but we waited a very long time for a basket of bread. By the time it came, our lunch was delivered about 3 mins. later! The bread won't win any awards, either. It had a soft crust which reminded me of the kind they sell at the Acme market.\n\nMy omelette was dry and lackluster. In fairness, my friend did enjoy her chicken salad. A table of five had vacated a table in front of ours. The dirty dishes sat there for at least 25 mins. The table was half-bussed. After 15 mins., the bussboy came back and bussed the next table over! It took a good 45  mins. before the original table was totally cleaned. Yuck! \n\nI expected a lot more from Rats and was very disappointed. I certainly won't go back for dinner (or any other meal) ever again. Does anyone manage this place??","2425":"Delicious food and drinks and wonderful service! Our waitress was kind, helpful, and attentive.  She was the best!  I ordered one of their usual cocktails but substituted the tequila for one of their house infused liquors. Their drinks all  look delicious.  We ordered the cornbread and drunken angel pasta dish.  It was all so great.  I would come here all the time if I lived in Tucson!","2426":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time after seeing great reviews. What I can't describe is how amazing the food is and how their customer service is above and beyond!! We will definitely be eating here again!!!","2427":"Where do I even start to explain how good their food is?  I could eat at The Parish every day for the rest of my life, does that explain how good it is?  Everything on the menu is delicious, even down to their remoulade that goes with their perfectly fried sweet and spicy huspuppies (salivating just thinking of them) BUT let's talk about the Drunken Angel! With my first bite I wanted to cry, good tears..  it hit every taste bud, hope and dream I  had as I ordered it and it gave me hope for for us foodies who love good food here in Old Pueblo!\n Each fork full there after had me making inappropriate noises and I was sure the table next to me was going to say \"I'll have what she's having\". The depth of flavor, good gracious! The saffron, lobster broth and cream beautifully smothered the burgundy pasta that was entwined with copious amounts of crawfish and shrimp.. it's addicting, and good for the soul!\nA Bonus to the food created and served with heart and  soul is their refreshing cocktails that are meticulously crafted. My favorite is the Caribbean mule.","2428":"I love Parish!  My favorite steak in Tucson. Daily specials are always fun and fantastic. This place is comfy, with personable and knowledgeable staff. Always a good time and fabulous meal here.","2429":"Absolutely One of my ALL TIME Favs! Absolutely Love the food,  drinks and atmosphere . The waitresses and staff are AMAZING Also. I drive 3 hours just to come to The Parish. So worth it!","2430":"I love when my customers let me pick a lunch spot! \n\nWe started with the bacon popcorn because who doesn't love bacon and popcorn! It was yummy! You should get this to share!\n\nI ordered the shrimp & grits paired with collard greens. Visually I thought the plate was to big .. but the plating was nice .. shrimp stacked nicely on top of grits and a huge pile of collard greens with pork. So many yummy flavors and that sauce was creamy goodness!\n\nMy lunch dates had the gumbo with hush puppies and the other had the drunken angel pasta dish. None of us was able to finish our plates, we all agreed this hit the spot.\n\nThe hush puppies were delicious too, I wish I had room for dessert! Service was fast & friendly. Will definitely be back! The bar area looks really cool, I'd love to come back for happy hour!","2431":"First time here and was impressed how boisterous and pre-COVID it felt, with waitlisted-only seating and nearly packed house (though we were told later it was not to capacity as usual.)\nWe soon found out why it was so crowded.  It's one of the most smoothly run restaurants in town. Clearly everyone knows their tasks, their responsibilities, and I sensed management tightly overseeing the operations.  Customers clearly appreciate this dependable and efficient service. \nWe were seated quickly enough and had one of the best servers I've experienced as well. Our server was proud of the place. She didn't forget anything, even after chatting us up and still remembering what we asked for before our long-drawn out conversation. We can be chatty with our server, and while holding heavy plates, she still appeared unencumbered. \nThe decor is dark, brooding, with basement-bar appeal, a sort of austere, shabby chic with kaleidoscopic lighting. However, unlike your favorite dive, this restaurant is spotless clean. \nWe ordered cocktails -- the pineapple caipirinha OMG! -- hush puppies and some brussels to start. Signature starts, and good portions. \n(Not totally off topic, but I know restaurants everywhere are serving sides and mains in bowls. I don't know why. I think bowls are for cereal. Can we return to putting dinner on plates, please?)\nWe had the drunken angel and red beans and rice with sausage for mains. Again, hearty portions and flavor.  \nMy favorite dish of the evening was surprising, as it's usually too heavy for me by dessert-time in other restaurants. But the bread pudding really was the best I'd ever had, quite distinctive. The server recommended a butterscotch whiskey, a perfect complement. \nI love a well-run establishment. It actually gives me goosebumps. And this place is about the best run in town. You can feel it. \nMy soft critique would be for more meat to feature on the menu, particularly the appetizer selection; it leans on the fried, carby side overall. You can only enjoy so much corn bread. I realize one can order the steak or salmon, but you know restaurants in Tucson only offer that because they think someone will always want to order it, which is sadly true!  But you don't come to The Parish for the steak or the salmon. Though I was a bit too, ahem, chicken, next time I really should really try the frog legs. \nThe Parish doesn't scream Tucson, which is why locals might love it. And I'm sure it's popular with out-of-towners because it's a dependable place to show off to your guests. \nThe Parish oozes of success.  I felt honored to be a part of it tonight.","2432":"We stopped at this fine restaurant on our way into Tucson. We had an early dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. Service was great. We started with the frog legs wrapped in bacon. Great flavor great dipping sauce, got to try it. I had the drunken Angel pasta. it was filled with tons of seafood. The sauce is fantastic and the angel hair pasta is soaked in burgundy. you have to try this. My husband had an andouille sausage poor boy and he said it was very good as well. If you're in Tucson don't miss this place.","2433":"I was disappointed in my experience at Rat's last night.  While the waiter was great, the food wasn't. First, the cheese plate was disgusting. My fiance and I love various cheeses, but their limited selection left us with pungent, dirty-feet-smelling cheeses that tasted foul, and the slices of bread that accompanied them were actually stale--not fresh and toasted but old, hard, and oxidized.  Plus, the portions were very small; in one case, most of our chunk was the husk. Unbelievably, even the blueberries were bad: crunchy in the middle with an internal slime-like consistency.  They were just meaty and full of rather large seeds--we had never experienced that before, and I am an ardent fan of the blueberry.  I actually spit mine out and then laughed as my fiance struggled through his.  While one can't help the way in which Mother Nature endows its fruit, maybe the kitchen staff should taste a few berries from each batch before serving them.  \n\nThen we tried the french onion soup, which, while not necessary \"bad,\" was the worst I'd ever had because it lacked salt and tasted immediately of barbecue sauce.  Not only was this a strange and unsuccessful combination of flavors, but not everyone enjoys sweet food, and I am not a fan of barbecue sauce.  Soup should be savory, not sweet.  Major disappointment.  \n\nI also noted the irony of ducks walking around outside beside the tables and swimming in the pond while the specialty of the evening was duck!  There was no way that I could eat a cooked duck while looking at live ones a few feet away.  \n\nNot feeling inclined toward many of the main courses that were being offered, I ordered the chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy, and was annoyed to discovered that the gravy was, again, enhanced (or I would say damaged) by--of all things--barbecue sauce, so that it tasted almost the same as the French onion soup; I was not getting much variety between the two dishes.  This dish wasn't necessarily \"bad\" either, but it wasn't impressive: 3 out of 5 stars. It tasted better the next morning, actually, after the flavors had marinated and the sweetness had mellowed.  I will note that neither the description for this dish, nor the one for the French onion soup, mentioned barbecue sauce.  If they had, I wouldn't have ordered them.\n\nThe roasted chicken itself lacked proper seasoning and did not taste as good as the rotisserie ones sold at my local grocery stores for a fraction of the cost.  \n\nWe enjoyed the wine but both agreed that the food did not live up to the high price or past reputation of the restaurant.  I will say that their seasoned butter was delicious and their pop-up rolls were strangely satisfying, but I have no desire to return for a meal because the appetizers and main course weren't enjoyable.\n\nFor some reason, what may have been the best dish of the house--the octopus appetizer--was no longer on the menu.\n\nI'd like to give \"props\" to the waiter whose honesty, friendliness, and attentiveness were refreshing.","2434":"Visiting Tucson for a weekend getaway and my husband's birthday.  We decided to try the number one restaurant that appeared on Yelp.  The Parish as we love some good southern food and that being their theme... When we arrived we were told it was a 90 minute wait, they don't take reservations as I checked before arriving. There was no place to wait so we waited in the car, as you can imagine there were several parties doing the same we had 17 parties in front of us on the wait list. Hoping that was a good sign of things to come we waited.  Watching the AP count down until our turn to be seated exactly 90 minutes.  We were seated and served by a very energetic young lady, I didn't get her name.  We were so hungry by then we over ordered but not knowing how long before our meal was served we chose a couple of appetizers.  Just like you are not supposed to go grocery shopping when hungry don't over order.... We tried the black and blue Brussels which were delicious with tangy black & blue berry carmelized coating, the bacon popcorn just had to try it and planned on taking it home, and the cornbread in cast iron.  All were delicious.  My husband ordered the Gumbo which he said was delicious.  I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage.  It was good but very spicy.  Overall the food and experience were good but not sure that I would wait 90 minutes when Tucson has so many other restaurants to try.","2435":"Always have a great time and wonderful food when we go here.  The Drunken Angel dish is the best. Make sure to go hungry and try a few appetizers like the frog legs and hush puppies. Going to the Parish without getting the cornbread should be considered a crime. We always have to order more.","2436":"The food and drinks are creative, prepared very well, and delicious! Love the cocktails. Dig the motif and vibe. Worth checking out","2437":"Wow!!! This place has great food! My husband and I found this place while heading back home from Phoenix and it did not dissapoint, i wish i would have tried their drinks but we mainly focused on how amazing was the food!","2438":"My brother and I tried this place for the first time on 2\/29\/20, so we were able to dine in during that time. I believe our waiter's name was Lawson, and he was very friendly and efficient. Always checked up on us and kept our drinks filled. We loved the vibe and decor. Laid back atmosphere for sure. The food was spectacular and had such great flavors. Really looking forward to when we are able to dine in this fine place again.","2439":"Travel to Tucson, and found this place. All dishes are great. Our server is very nice. He kept saying he is new, but did great job recommending us the food. \nKids love their meals. What else can parents ask for more when you are in a good restaurant and the kids just eat the food and leave you alone. \nToo bad we came from Los Angeles and it will be hard to come back again","2440":"Great food, great service and solid ambience.  Brussel sprouts, pork rinds and corn bread were favs.  You have to try this place if you love or are visiting Tucson","2441":"We love this place. It's a great place to have a nice dinner. Food is creative and always delicious. The service is always good. This is a welcoming place where you can have a nice dinner and enjoy some creative foods as well,  a bit of a twist.  New Orleans inspired.  For today we started out with the bacon popcorn. Very tasty. Then we had the New York strip and fries oh sooo good. The garlic encrusted prime rib also pretty amazing. For desert the mixed berry tart with marshmallow fluff and balsamic reduction. A perfect ending. Not overly sweet just pretty perfect. Their twist on a mimosa well worth trying. A great dinner, again.","2442":"What a fun place to celebrate a birthday!  Their were seven of us so they gave us the parlor room.  It took me right back to New Orleans!   Their hushpuppies and brussel sprouts were delicious.  The others tried the frog legs (not me!) and they raved!   The drunken pasta with seafood  is a dish my husband will make the trip across town for.  The catfish also received good reviews.  THeir french fries (order them crispy) were the best I have found in Tucson.  Their pulled pork sandwich was delicious but a little more sauce would have been appreciated.  Birthday boy loved their bread pudding.  We will be back!","2443":"Wanted dinner on our second night here in Tucson. Looked this place up and thought why not. When you walk in they greet you with a smile and we were seated quickly. After looking over the menu I ordered the red beens and rice with andouille sausage and Bobbie chose the gumbo with shrimp and crawfish. My beans had a great flavor, probably one of the best I've had, and Bobbies gumbo was flavorful with just a hint of heat. The shrimp and crawfiah was perfectly cooked, a lot of places over cook shellfish. Hers came with hushpuppies that had a crunchy exterior and a warm soft interior. I saw they had Pappy Van Winkle so even though its expensive I ordered a glass of 15 year that I had a bit with dinner but used most as my desert. Overall this was an excellent dinner and we had enough leftovers for dinner the next night. Highly recommended!","2444":"We went for Thanksgiving dinner this year and there were four of us my wife and two neighbors.\nI ordered the pear arugula salad which was just OK nothing to rave about my appetizer was duck liver pate which was a little bit of pate on top of stale toast I couldn't even taste any liver in the pate. I ordered the turkey dinner they said you would get a mix of white and dark meat I only got dry white over cooked meat pieces. A quarter cup of stuffing was served -a small smear of mashed potatoes and about 7 string beans. They served a thimble sized container of cranberry sauce which was half full. The dessert I chose was the pumpkin bread pudding which didn't resemble bread pudding at all but a round lump of stale pieces of bread chunks with no taste of pumpkin whatsoever. I left hungry and I was very disappointed. The other guests and my wife were also upset regarding their dinners each couple paid over $178. We did have 4 drinks which added to the bill. Next year we'll be cooking our own dinner at home-- Service was also lacking had to keep asking the waiter to fill glass bring more bread- where is our meal -but we do understand it's still Covid related....","2445":"Love the food and the friendly staff!\nThe bacon popcorn is scrumptious as are the drinks!\nKathy","2446":"Dined here today and was extremely pleased. Raf \/ Raphael was an incredibly personable server and wisely recommended the prime rib sandwich, which was delicious. The Sunset at Monet Bridge cocktail complimented my meal well, and was perfectly balanced. To top it off, the ambiance and setting -- overlooking a pond near the sculpture garden -- elevated the experience all the more. \n\nI felt sorry for all the people who thought they could just stroll on in and sit wherever without a reservation. With just a couple minutes of planning, they could've had an equally beautiful time.","2447":"Had brunch here when visiting Tucson. Ample parking space outside, and conveniently located. Liked their inner decorations with lots of southern elements. I had the chicken wings with waffle, one of their specials and had lots of compliments. The wings were deep fried and they tasted crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Went well with the chili sauce. The waffle was served with cheese, sliced peaches and maple syrup. Very nice and typical southern bites and enjoyed my time here.","2448":"First time visit\n\n2 pm Saturday lunch - with reservations\n\nWarm, friendly greeting upon entering \n\nTrying French Onion Soup, Steak Frites and a Watermelon Kiwi Punch \n\nGreat atmosphere","2449":"We've been here a few times and always leave satisfied and wondering why we don't come more often.  The ambience brings you to the French Quarter inside.  The corn bread is reliably amazing each visit.  The catfish and the shrimp Po' boys were great.   Enjoyed the gumbo at a previous visit as well.  It has been a reliable place to go for something different than usual Tucson offerings and satisfying each visit. I hear they have great cocktails too but haven't had a chance to try those yet.... just another reason to head back again.","2450":"Really used to love going to this restaurant, we usually go once a year.\nThe gardens are beautiful but it really stops there.\nWe  went early to hang at the bar and take in the ambiance.\nNeither bartenders wanted to engage at all with the patrons.\n( they where not that busy).\nwe all ordered French onion soup and all portions sizes where filled half way and warm at best.\nMy seafood risotto was less then warm sent back twice!\ndid not have to be piping hot but warm to touch would have nice.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday we ordered 2 desserts they both came out of kitchen at separate times.\nBut  what became funny was a third birthday dessert arrived shortly after. Ok free dessert as we finished a 4th unordered birthday candle dessert showed up!!\n But the number one reason I will not forget or return back to this charming restaurant would be this $2.00 charge.\nI ordered an oban scotch on the rocks, it was $19 fair enough, wait for it... and a $2.00 charge separate line item on our bill for $2.00 for rocks. So whoever the genius in this organization that came up with hey I know how to increase revenue let's charge for a glass of Ice!\nBrilliant let's leave our guests with that to remember when they leave us!\nhahaha \nJoe","2451":"Feels like you're in a small hideaway in New Orleans. The decor and aromas greet you from the door like a hug...\n\nHubby & I opted to sit at the bar. Great choice for us because the bartender was generous in her recommendations for drink and food.  We love that they infuse many of their own alcohols and know how to compliment the attributes with perfect mixes.\n\nDinner was divinely New Orleans - rich and plentiful. Unfortunately we didn't leave room for dessert. Looks like we'll have to return for cocktails and bread pudding another night!","2452":"We love The Parish and have introduced it to several friends who now love it, too. Unique menu items, every one delicious! I wish I'd learn to ask that the cornbread be served with the meal rather than before. It is so amazingly good, I eat it like a pig and barely save room for dinner!","2453":"Ordered takeout. The shrimp po boy was not good at all, definitely tasted off. Could barely taste the shrimp as it was mostly breading. Very disappointed as I read all the raving reviews about this. The fries were also very lackluster, seasoning was off and tasted as if it wasn't fully cooked. The corn bread is definitely not your typical corn bread, but it was very yummy.","2454":"The Bear and I were ravenous for some lunch after our flight from Chicago. I found this place thanks to Yelp, of course!\n\nInside the restaurant I immediately felt the New Orleans vibe. It was very festive and chill, but we opted to sit outside to enjoy the weather.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal, although had some mixed reviews on some things.\n\n*Black & Blue Brussels - These are insanely yummy! If I had bread or fries, I probably would have wiped up the rest of black and blueberry hot sauce. (Bear - , Me - )\n*Red Beans & Rice with Andouille Sausage - The Bear thoroughly inhaled this, so a big yes from him. I tried a little and it was ok. BUT I am not a big bean person and I am finicky about my rice! (Bear - , Me - just )\n*Shrimp & Grits, side of collard greens - It was recommended by our server and I loved it! The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the grits... WOW. I don't remember grits ever tasting this good. And I lived in Texas for 3 years! The fried white cheddar grits were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. And then you get some of the Creole BBQ cream sauce on it? Heaven... My only regret is not taking the server's advice and get the fries instead of the collard greens (to mop up that amazing sauce). I was trying to get more veg in my diet though. The Bear loved the collard greens. (Bear - , Me - )\n\nService was fast and friendly. I would definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu!","2455":"Making the top 100 restaurants at one point on Yelp, the Parish did not disappoint. Despite the initial 40 minute wait, my group decided to sneak to the bar because we were starving. The drinks were so dang good, love that they have seasonal options and a wide variety of spirits at their unique bar. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, pork rinds, fried catfish, pulled pork sandwich, and the heavens angel pasta. Holy. Crap. This was all so flavorful and delicious, my favorite was probably the red beans and rice or even the rich and delicious pasta. Everything was so unique and honored the very essence of the southern food. The staff was super sweet and accommodating. I can't say enough good things about this spot other than why the heck did I not go sooner?","2456":"Came here one sunny Sunday afternoon after seeing it was on the Yelp top 100 for 2020. With that I had extremely high hopes and was excited to see what the restaurant had to offer. While there was great service I must say the food was lacking. I ordered the gumbo with a side of hush puppies . My table started off with the cornbread, thinking it was going to be a sweet, yellow fluff cake much like other skillet cornbreads. It was brought to the table and surprisingly had a blue tint. Upon tasting it it reminded us slightly of a blueberry muffin which my table was not expecting. We were not a fan. The gumbo had a nice kick however somehow still lacked the necessary flavor profile of a truly good gumbo. I will say the hushpuppies on the side were the highlight of the meal. A friend of mine ordered the eggplant veggie burger which she found to be good but unimpressive. While my mom had the red beans and rice (with high expectations) only to be let down as well with how basic and unexciting they were. I definitely expected more from a restaurant on the top 100 list for Yelp.","2457":"C'est Magnifique! \n\nHot Lunch Jam...\n\nI was a bit hesitant my first visit to The Parish, as I was in the mood for something healthier and light. I didn't know how many options a \"Southern-fusion gastropub\" had to offer. But, ooh wee! I was pleased to find a warm, spicy, chile & garlic bowl of edamame on the menu, as well as an appetizer of 'build-your-own' crostini with chilled pecan smoked ruby red trout, onion marmalade, roasted garlic, and Dijon. Perfect portion sizes for a light & delightful meal! Another visit, I decided on the grilled petite NY steak salad and was sorely disappointed that it came out in 'wedge' form. I usually do not like to have to deconstruct a salad -- I want it chopped & ready to go, lol! After tasting it, though, I would have gladly spent hours taking it apart...bit by glorious bit. Perfectly cooked med rare lusciousness, with romaine, red onion, gorgeous heirloom tomatoes, anchovy vin, and to-die-for bleu & cream cheese croutons. Alas, even though I initially came in seeking healthier fare, my favorite creation has come to be the Drunken Angel pasta. This exquisite dish is SO rich, with burgundy-bathed angel hair, succulent shrimp and crawfish, lobster broth, and saffron & red pepper cream sauce, that I cannot even finish a lunch portion. Worth every single guilt-laden calorie, haha!\n\nThe Music of the Night et La Vie Boheme...\n\nMusic and art seem to be part of the heart and soul of The Parish. They often host musical performers, so make sure to check their website for upcoming events. This past Mardi Gras, we were treated to great live Dixieland and rock-a-billy shows along with a crawfish boil. (I ordered a $12 sampler of Cajun delights -- ooh wee! -- red beans & rice, chicken & andouille gumbo, spicy crawfish hushpuppies, collards, and smoked shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e.) They are strong supporters of local art, and rotate the pieces hanging along the walls. Right now, they have some wonderful, very vibrant pieces by Liz Weibler. This past December, they shut down for a few weeks, to expand the operation (located in a strip mall on Oracle). It is indeed roomier and still has an inviting 'Southern pub' feel to it, with bright colors and distressed wood. I often sit at the bar and have had only one occasion that I was unhappy with the service. 3 bartenders -- at a half-empty bar -- failed to offer a food menu (after a very long period of time). They had offered a drinks menu, however, and that was served. Finally, when asked for a menu, they failed to ask if food was indeed wanted (after another extremely long period of time). They were busying themselves cashing out the drawer, etc. This was the only time I can say that I left (without ordering any food!) truly unsatisfied with my visit. \n\nCocktail Counterpoint...\n\nIn a previous review, I stated that my favorite local cocktail had a rival. Well, it's still a battle...but, as a gin lover, Parish's Dutch Well Water (house-infused cucumber gin, lime juice, peach bitters, and lavender water) is a sure contender. It is incredibly refreshing, and it's perfect for those hot AZ summer days and nights! I believe one of the bartenders said it was his own concoction. Merci! If you're not partial to gin, try the Aqua Vita with Deep Eddy vodka, mint, peach bitters, lemon, and cranberry. Delish! They also have an array of craft & import beers, spirits, and offer 2 gluten-free beers. \n\nHappy Hour @ The Parish is Monday - Friday, 3 - 6 pm, $3 wells, drafts, and $4 house wine.","2458":"Yelper's come through again!  Based on all the positive reviews we decided to give this place a try and oh so good!  Frog legs are fantastic wrapped in bacon and the hush puppies are outstanding!  Seriously good eats, but hold on... cocktails are even better!!!! They offer several cocktails and I must say they're delicious!   We'll return!  I highly recommend","2459":"Came here as a guest for a bridal shower on a Saturday . The decor  is beautiful and unique and the food was very good . I'm only giving it two stars because I found the staff to be rather nasty. When another guest and I asked for a drink, the waitress snapped that she was taking food orders which followed by her telling us to \" just wait.\"  She never came back to take the orders and we had to flag down a different waiter . The staff was clearly impatient and rushing to get through the party. They barely smiled and were also inpatient taking dessert orders . I understand it's a timed event but geez don't look and act so grim at a happy event .","2460":"We have been coming here for over 20 years. Our family of 7 went there today for a get together.  Yes, I understand that they may have been understaffed. However, most of the appetizers we ordered were barely warm or inedible. The French onion soup had no bread in the bottom of the bowl and tasted straight out of a can. The shrimp were a bit too salty. The escargot with puff pastry...the escargot was barely warm and tasteless; the puff pastry was soggy. How long had our food been sitting there waiting for delivery?  We had ordered the charcuterie app when we first sat down. It didn't show up until the rest of the food was delivered. We had planned to munch on this while the rest of the food was being prepared.   Well...another restaurant off the list; I see no reason to ever go back.","2461":"I've dined here 2 X in the past month & both times the food & service was excellent. Server 1st time was Kelcey & I had the decadent Drunken Angel; angel hair pasta cooked in Burgandy wine, a rich & tasty lobster broth & lotsa crawfish & shrimp,  The bread pudding was dense & delicious, but overpriced @$8. 8 of us were there last night & Hunter was our waiter.  It was HH & I enjoyed 2 tasty beers for only $4 each.  The roasted Brussel sprouts were the best that  Ive ever had, by far. To complete my meal I thoroughly enjoyed a up of their fabulous gumbo.","2462":"Not even sure where to begin... The menu was eccentric, the food was superb, and the drinks were even better. The ambiance, just like the menu, brings to life the Cajun,Texan, Mexican vision. The gumbo with hush puppies was wonderful - the Brussels sprouts with candied walnuts, scrumptious - the seafood medley with angel hair pasta, exquisite - the el verdad cocktail game changer... Will definitely be back to patron this wonderful establishment.","2463":"This is a great local spot. Good burger, good fish and chips and great bread pudding. We like the New Orleans dishes as well.","2464":"Everything at The Parish is so good! We always start with the bacon popcorn and the hushpuppies. The Shrimp & Grits are the best I have ever had. It's hard not to lick the plate. I also love the Smokin' Angel and the Trout. My mom tells everyone who will listen about the Compressed Watermelon Salad. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the waiters are wonderful too.","2465":"Love this taste of New Orleans in Tucson! The atmosphere is so fun, the staff is friendly, and the food is to die for! I love their cocktails and bacon popcorn appetizer. The Parish has been a neat hangout place for many celebrations in my family!","2466":"Felt so great to see all my beautiful Queens for dinner. This Cajun themed restaurant was very unique and cozy. Customer service was on point. The bacon wrapped frog legs , bacon popcorn and Drunken Angel pasta with Shrimp was delish . There was 8 of us for dinner reservations in the parlor and we were seated on time and served and done by 830pm","2467":"I lived in New Orleans for 34 years and I've eaten in this place a number of times. The problem with transporting that type of food is the ingredients are simply not available at the price and quality they are in New Orleans. So for instance, a New Orleans shrimp poor boy literally has shrimp overflowing out of the bread loaf. To do the same in Tucson you'd have to price the poorboy about thirty-five bucks, which obviously won't work. And that's why New Orleans food has never really translated.\n All that being said, what has translated is the high quality of cooking one finds in New Orleans which this restaurant certainly seeks to uphold.\nIt's also very successful bar and has many special events featuring barbecue etc..","2468":"Updated review - worth all the stars! We love the Parish. This spot is located conveniently close to our house and we've been there now on many occassions since moving to Tucson a few years ago, both for dine-in pre-pandemic and multiple times for carryout during quarantine. Favorite dishes include the burger (always more than I can eat, and the flavor delivers) and the Drunken Angel Pasta. You don't find a lot of Cajun\/Creole\/Southern flair in Tucson, so this spot is super welcome. Even our delicious carry-out Thanksgiving dinner delivered on delicious flavor and taste with far more flair than I could ever pull off at home. (I'm a stuffing snob, and this was the BEST stuffing I've ever had.) There's always something new to enjoy at the Parish - from cocktails to takeout specials to yummy new menu items - and we feel so lucky to have them in our neighborhood!","2469":"We had lunch here on Saturday 9\/18\/10 and it was fabulous. The restaurant was extremely busy with lunch patrons as well as a wedding in full swing, but service did not skip a beat. We had the escabeche of olives, the artisanal cheese plate, a bottle of Director's Cut Coppola Chardonnay, the Mussels Et Frites, and Chicken Confit \"Salad\". We also had the brownie dessert to share with Graham's 20 year port. Everything was perfect. I loved my Chicken Confit and I am not even a dark meat lover. It was served over a carrot puree that was delicious, with frisee and haricot vert on top. It was all very tasty. I read another review that called this same entree \"cafeteria food\". That makes me want to laugh outloud but, to each his own. I don't know how you could give it a bad mark.\n\nOur server was Benjamin and he was very personable. Everyone from the hostess, to the gentleman who served the wine, the food runners, were intent on providing good service.\n\nWe were here for the sculpture park. It is 1.5 hours from home so I won't be able to have dinner anytime soon but would love to. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice. Overlooking the pond, cozy interior. Very nice. It is a perfect special occasion place.","2470":"Enjoyed my first time at the parish it was very tasty enjoyed my shrimp and grits and warm service good atmosphere definitely would go back and eat again","2471":"Mmmm \nI was underwhelmed really. They are taking some precautions for COVID however the restaurant was pretty crowded and all tables were filled, I mean great atmosphere and all but I wished they had a bit more social distancing and maybe limit their capability. \nService was excellent and all staff was wearing masks so this was 5\/5. \nFood 3\/5. The best course were the hush puppies  and their tap beer selection. The food was not really impressive, we got the poboy which was under-seasoned and too much bread. \nNot sure we want to come right back to try this place. \nBut again the atmosphere was very nice, lots of people seem to love this spot, i can totally see why. Just too crowded for COVID times.","2472":"I have to confess that the only things my wife and I have had here have been the bacon popcorn and the Parishioner cocktail. We are happily stuck on these items now. We'd gone in several months ago wanting to have a couple drinks at the bar. We ordered one popcorn to snack on while we hung out. It warned us that it was addictive, but did we listen?  Nooooo. So we had to order more. Today, we decided to break down and try getting it delivered. I admit, I had reservations, thinking how good will it be when it finally gets here? It was still hot and buttery and fresh, with crunchy pieces of bacon--and everything we remembered it to be when we were at the restaurant. (Thankfully we'd had the awareness this time to order two.) And we were able to have the drinks delivered too, two drinks to a mason jar. Sooo good. House infused basil vodka, lemon and grapefruit flavors. (I should warn you, this is pretty addictive too!) We'd braced for disappointment, but were so happily surprised.","2473":"I thought this place was great at first but the staff here is terrible! Something happened to my family member where they fell down and the staff just starred and did nothing. It took a CUSTOMER to come ask if everything was ok and if we needed anything. This happened right in front of the hostess stand! The hostess went and told the manager all of her staff before I called manager over to talk to her about what happened. This is absolutely heartless and what kind of human would just sit back and watch! I assure you they will not get my business or any future business of mine or my company.","2474":"While Cajon, creole or southern food typically isn't my go-to, The Parish was amazing! Indoor\/outdoor available, we sat inside and had the best lunch in awhile, snd our waitress was SO nice and accommodating. \nWe ordered hushpuppies (yum!), the Parish burger (husband said it was legit), and I had the smoked salmon salad which was fantastic! I got a cucumber gin drink (which I normally do not like gin, but the waitress\/bartender recommended it and I'm glad I tried it, so light and refreshing!) \nWould return if we're ever in Tuscon again.","2475":"The happy hour is really amazing! The hush puppies and gumbo are true standouts! I've had several of their signature cocktails, and they are all extremely delicious.","2476":"I love all their food! The atmosphere is amazing. I would consider this a MUST for places to eat in Tucson.","2477":"Amazing dining experience. My husband and I are on a quest to have date night once a week, and my husband eventually got sick of me taking him to the same three places (he won't admit it, but I know he did, and I definitely do prefer my favorites). I saw The Parish one night while picking up some sushi next door and became interested. After being told by a friend that the late night menu was sub-par, I kind of pushed the idea away. \n\nThen I got curious. And then I just had to go, because I have seen several really good reviews from this place. I also was in the mood for something new and Southern food sounded like it would hit the spot. And... I am SO HAPPY we decided to go. \n\nWe ordered the hushpuppies and the edamame for appetizers. The edamame was good, but I wouldn't say it was super special. I would much rather tell you about how delish the hushpuppies were--yummy! I could fill up on those alone, and totally would. They came with a sauce that I don't think it needed. But these are amazing and I totally recommend them--I am pretty sure they are on the late night menu as well (for those of you out there wondering). \n\nMy husband ordered the steak frites--wow. The presentation was great. The steak was super tender and he really liked it. I, on the other hand, went with the quail because I was being bold. It was amazing! Again, the presentation was great. These are big full meals, so even though it is a bit pricier than most places, it is well worth it. \n\nOrdered two specialty drinks that were amazing. I am not sure what they were called... one was the Parishoner I believe. I'd go back just for that. But the entire meal was great. Service was also amazing and I am now telling everyone that I know that this is a great place for a nice dinner. Yummy!","2478":"The food here is delightful, decadent and delicious. \nWe were able to join the waitlist before we made the 25 minute drive from our Airbnb to North Tuscon. We got there just as they were ready to seat us which I loved because this hungry girl didn't have to wait!\nThe decor is a funky and cool and the vibe is unique. \nOur server and service was great. She did a great job explaining the must haves on the menu and the why. Always love a server who can give you knowledgeable advice. \nWe ordered the Drunken Angel which is very rich - I'd recommend this as a good dish to share because it may be too much if you eat the whole thing yourself! We also had the Backyard burger which was nicely done. \nAnd the hush puppies were awesome. Definitely recommend getting an order of those!","2479":"The frog legs were outstanding.  Nice menu choices. The atmosphere was very pleasant.  Would go back again.","2480":"I came here because a lot of Yelpers whom I trust have said great things about it. I have to say that it did not disappoint ...  The menu was super fun...the decor is very interesting and you can tell there was thought put into it... There are painting from local artists on the walls that are way out of my price range but look nice and feel like they belong there... The music in The Parish makes ya feel like you are in the French quarter of New Orleans ... The are do many interesting things on the menu from mussels to frog legs to southern edamame. \n\nEverything has a little kick to it do the turkey and gravy crowd may have trouble... This is a neat place all the way around.. Perfect for a date but still kid friendly earlier during lunch or during the work week...","2481":"This is one of my favorite places on the north side of Tucson. Their drinks are fantastic and the food is wonderful. The Parish Burger and bacon popcorn are staples on the menu. So delicious. Always get great service and the atmosphere is nice.","2482":"______The Short Story________\n\nAmbiance: Nice, dark rich woods and leather, high end. Comfortable. Romantic in appearance, but not romantic. Over the top LOUD.\nDrinks: Lacking more than a few draught choices. Bottles and cans for beer, mostly. Wine. Mixed drinks seems to be their thing here. I landed with the Non-Alcoholic Lemonade drink and it was tasty. I had two.\nService: Inattentive, slow, unpleasant, aggressive, rude\nFood: TERRIBLE\nHusband's Description: Fiasco\nThis is a BAR with hoity-toity prices for bar food that really isn't par with hoity-toity or the price. I guess bar food - is bar food - is bar food, no matter how much you try to elevate it.\n\n_______The Long Story______\n\nI had high hopes for this place. and have been pestering my husband to go for a couple years whenever we come visit our hometown. We arrived to a cozy little spot that was decorated to the nines in deep colors, dark woods, and comfy seating. Their draught list is short. Too short. They have bottles and cans of beer. I looked at their signature mixed drinks but nothing sparked my fancy so I moved down to the non-alcoholic section. I ordered a lemonade of sorts, mixed with other flavors and ingredients. It was fantastic.\nOur server was off-putting at best. Personality-wise, he was unpleasant in demeanor and tone. We also noticed that he was inattentive and slow from the very start.\nAPPS:\nWe started off with a cornbread. It sounded like it was just going to be cornbread. But it wasn't just run of the mill cornbread. It was gritty like some, but it was a strange color. Blue corn? It looked green under the light. Green food is a turn-off for me, unless it's veggies. Taste was not that of any corn or cornbread. It was too crumbly to eat with a fork, and they didn't give us spoons. I had a pile of crumbs on my plate. The lump of funky colored buttery like substance was strange-tasting.\nMAIN DISH:\nI ordered the Drunken Angel. It sounded right up my alley in flavors I like, in a delicious-sounding cream sauce. My husband ordered the Fish and Chips.\nBeginning with my husband, his fish was dipped in some odd-tasting batter. He struggled through it, but managed to finish. His French Fries were decent he said.\nMy pasta was weird looking and super unpleasantly fishy smelling and not what I expected. It looked like a mass of melted cheese on top of a dark-colored pasta making me question the description I read. I asked, and they were cooked with wine, so that was the color, not whole-wheat noodles. The smell was the kind that smacks you in the face. I don't like that ever. I pushed through the smell to taste the pasta, and it was okay, although very fishy tasting. I mixed the heaps of melted Parmesan into the little bit of cream sauce (too much cheese, y'all). I gobbled up a shrimp. It accidentally slipped down my throat when I meant to find someplace else to put it besides the cloth napkin. The shrimp was NOT fresh, possibly verging on the side of dangerous. And that was the end of that. I can't eat a dish that stinks fishy, tastes old, and is overcooked. Yeah... The shrimp wasn't just not-fresh, it was a massively overcooked, tight little rubber ball.\nI pushed the plate to the edge to try and catch the server's attention. He didn't even glance for a long time.  that I found it to be not good, not fresh, and that I couldn't eat it. He didn't say anything, took it, and walked away.\nNext thing, a looming woman comes over and interrogates me about the food wasn't to my liking, and why. Manager I assumed. Aggressive. Loud. I told her that the shrimp didn't taste fresh and that I was unable to eat it. I did not mention overcooked, so as not to sully the issue and end up with another *unfresh* shrimp dish. She proceeded to shout at me why I was wrong about the shrimp because it's delivered daily. Her attempts to scare me into keeping the dish were unsuccessful. I suggested she follow up with her vendors because it wasn't fresh. Daily or not. Not fresh is NOT FRESH. She asked what else she could get me. And although I really wasn't interested I told her \"French Fries\". She was annoyed about that too, and grumbled as she walked away. I thought that was safe, because potatoes are potatoes and french fries are french fries and kinda hard to muck up. Plus, my husband said his were decent. Not great, but decent. And decent I can do.\nThey were not decent. They were sour. SOUR FRENCH FRIES. My husband tasted my fries because he didn't think his had been sour. But as soon as he tasted it, sure enough, he noticed it too. He tried one of his own fries still on his plate to compare. Fine. Went back to my fries. SOUR. He was irritated at this point, and he's super patient.\nDO NOT GO HERE\nFOOD BAD AND NOT FRESH\nSERVICE AWFUL INATTENTIVE AND RUDE","2483":"This was hands down our best meal around Oro Valley when we visited last December 2021. We enjoyed our meal and drinks, both the food and drink menu is unique and flavorful. If you're in town check out this place. \n\nIt is located in a strip mall area and finding a parking spot can be a little challenging.","2484":"Heard so much about the food so was excited to dine here. I enjoyed my meal but it was a bit heavy for me. Left feeling a bit sluggish. \n\nService was great.","2485":"Our waiter was good but a little late topping off our coffees, but overall service was good. The style is not modern, more outdated, but not as bad thing, it fits to the environment. We ordered the Seafood Salad, the Mussels, and the smoked salmon appetizer. A very memorable lunch!","2486":"We were looking for a good dinner place that was a little different and a bit fun. This place fit the bill. Our server, Chelsea, was awesome! She was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a couple appetizers; the bacon popcorn and black & blue brussel sprouts. Both were very tasty! There were 4 of us and we each ordered something different; every one of the dishes were quite tasty! Great little restaurant in an inconspicuous shopping center.","2487":"Would had been five stars if the service was better.. our hostess was  more on the ball then our server.  we got our beers after we got our food and had to ask again. Other then that food was quite good... very fun swanky atmosphere, would be cute little date place","2488":"This is has been on my \"want to try list\" for years and I finally had time to come last weekend. Unfortunately they said I made indoor reservations so I was unable to sit outside. Other than that the experience was great from start to finish (minus a screaming child at a nearby table that was then moved inside next to my table - not the restaurants fault, I guess?). The food was incredible. I started with the charcuterie board, followed by the bronzino (amazing), with a fancy drink and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Our service was great and the food came out in a reasonably paced time. Obviously the grounds are beautiful and I loved walking around the restaurant side after lunch! Overall great experience, I'll definitely be back!","2489":"I totally understand why they were voted best happy hour. We went for dinner however the star of the show was their cocktails and hush puppy appetizer. Both were absolutely delicious! The drinks were delicate and not overly sweet with complex flavors. They are a bit pricey but they are well worth it. The hush puppies were moist and flavorful. The food was also good - a little on the heavy side but tasty nonetheless. They had a limited menu but enough variety to satisfy anyone's hunger. I highly recommend the drunken angel pasta if going for dinner. We will be back; hopefully for happy hour!","2490":"Rating: 3.5\/5.\n\nOur group of fourteen enjoyed the bar and clean venue. \n\nThe highlight of the dinner was the indulgent homemade cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The backdrop of the lovely garden was soothing.\nFor appetizers to share, the size portion of the mash aubergine, hummus, olive, quinoa and cheese trays were small.\nThe situation was identical for the traditional $32 branzino with couscous.\n\nThe service was efficient.\n\nThe parking was free.","2491":"Usually good food here but not a fan of my burned burger. When I told the waitress all I got was an apology. I wonder if the management has changed as this was not the same expereience.","2492":"Get the Brussels!! Great flavors! Best you can get locally. Cool environment\/ bar area.","2493":"Good good. I had the drunken angel and it was very rich and delicious. The hush puppies are fantastic. Burger was also good. The noise level is very high so be prepared. Very good service. We wore masks when we arrived, went to restrooms, and left, and we were the only ones we saw. Overall a good experience. If it hadn't been so hot outside, o would have asked to move to the patio.","2494":"First time visiting this Cajun eatery and we weren't disappointed.\n\nWe split an incredible dish, the Drunken Angel with Burgundy angel hair pasta, shrimp, crawfish, lobster broth, saffron red pepper cream sauce, fresh parmesan.\n\nIt was sooooooo good.  We'll be back.","2495":"What a wonderful find!!  We eat out a lot and this place was great.   They take so much pride in their food and how it's prepared.  We had David wait on us and he was absolutely wonderful.","2496":"Our first time but not our last. For starters, their drink menu is great and they have a variety of flavored tequila, vodka and gin...\nTheir Drunken Angel dish was delicious with a big piece of bread to soak up the delicious sauce, comes with a good amount of shrimp. My hubby had the Fish n Chips which was also very good, fries are nice and crispy. \nWill definitely come back","2497":"Shrimp and grits with greens. \nThat's what you get. \nYum!!!\nGreat menu with better service. \nHighly recommended.","2498":"Second time and this place should be awesome, like knock your socks off awesome, but it's a hard meh at best. Service was actually pretty bad. We got some serious attitude from the young lady when we arrived, made us feel unwelcome. The waiter was meh. The food, unremarkable and un memorable. Two stars only because of the potential of the space. Save your money and go elsewhere.","2499":"The experience is muted during mysterious pandemic-inspired measures such as blocking the entrance from Grounds for Sculpture and preferentially seating outside in subfreezing weather, but the French Onion soup and fresh breads make it worthwhile. The teas are from \"Two Leaves and a Bud\" and highly recommended for the aforementioned outdoor winter seating. Nothing else was as good as the soup; escargots were average, shrimp with chorizo was uninspired and the Brussels sprouts much too sweet. The tall, handsome European waiter was a consummate professional and made up for the schoolmarmish attitudes of the other staff.","2500":"The chef here has a real talent. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Fish and chips were the best I have had in AZ. Yay! They don't have a great selection of on tap beers but I guess I can accept that ;)","2501":"The service and servers were great. Food mediocre for cost. I've come to this restaurant several times and it has  gone down hill in the past 2-3 years. The only thing that saves it is the setting.","2502":"I don't know what happened when the folks who gave Rats a lousy review ate there but that ain't the way it is now. I've eaten here twice in the last few months and each time it has been a great dining experience. \n\nFirst is the venue. This place is an adult fairy tale. The grounds are beautiful by day or by night. The dining rooms are French Country and the bar is a cozy hideaway. At my first meal here, a banquet for thirty five, we dined in the pavilion, a wonderfully dramatic room for functions. Needless to say the sculpture gardens are spectacular in their own right. \n\nService was pleasant and professional although the waiter dribbled a little wine on the table when serving it. \n\nThe food is excellent. As noted, the first time I ate here was an event where thirty five of us were served the same five course meal. A tough challenge for any kitchen specializing in high end meals. All courses were great, One was particularly memorable, a poached lobster appetizer. On our most recent visit I had the house smoked salmon which was superb. As a main course I had the braised short rib, exquisitely prepared with fantastic frites and a water cress salad with a horseradish dressing. My companions had the onion soup and mussels with frites,both of which were to die for! \n\nThe wine list is limited and pricey but good. Rats Red the house selection is a nice blend. \n\nI'd recommend that those who had an unpleasant experience in the past give it a retry and those that haven't ,go out of their way to try it. I know I'll be back.","2503":"Went to the Parish for the first time last night and we were quite impressed! The atmosphere was very cozy, and fun at the same time! A little live music on Sunday night and a nice variety of beer and wine, as well as craft drinks available! Our server-grrr I'm so bad, I think her name was Lexi? Was AWESOME! Very welcoming and happy, and seemed to enjoy her job! She was able to provide suggestions on the beers on tap, as well as favorites on the menu! My husband and I went with the Drunken Angel, a delicious crawfish and shrimp pasta dish, and the Quail-which were both cooked to perfection and full of flavor! Although we didn't have room for dessert they offered a beignet that we couldn't pass up! They came with 6 in a batch, we each ate one and took the rest home-they were delightful! We look forward to being regulars at the Parish!","2504":"Delish- hush puppies, pork rinds, parish burger, steak frites, weapon something and easy going. \n\nHush puppies are good a bit heavy and darker than I'm used too. Great flavor! \n\nPork rinds- gotta love that Arizona pork ear with a bit of hot sauce. Yummo to me as a Yaqui girl but not my hubs jam. \n\nSteak frites. Yes- those fries and sauce was like poutine but better cause nice tasty steak w a good sear. Tasty chunks of salt hot you when you need them most! \n\nBurger- omygosh that blue cheese. Can I just eat that with ummm everything. Loved that the burger had several different distinct flavors, but didn't taste like a pile of sugar.","2505":"OK, this was a pleasant surprise! We are visiting in Oro Valley, and we drove to Tucson for dinner at this place. Drinks were delicious and surprisingly unique, same with the food. Seriously! Bacon popcorn, red beans and rice, angel hair pasta with goat cheese, and so many other delicious surprises on the menu.  Just know, it's spicy!! \nYou would not want to miss this!","2506":"I was thrilled to get an early lunch reservation on a Friday while perusing through the Grounds for Sculptures. We even got outdoor seating which stole the show! \n\nSadly the pros of this visit stopped there. There were a lot of staff working, at least the day we went, however everyone kind of just seemed all over the place. While we were there we counted over 12 parties confused of where to find the hostess area to tell them they have arrived for their reservations. Very all over the place and very distracting to us as we almost felt like we were working by constantly having to re direct fellow customers. \n\nI was expected to be blown out of the water for the prices ($18 for 5 shrimp lunch platter). It all fell flat. My sister ordered one of the few vegan dishes (roasted cauliflower) and it was very one note. Missing salt and basic seasonings. The $12 French onion soup was probably one of the worst sitting right with low end diner quality. The asparagus was cut up into small pieces, like for a toddler . The only thing that we did enjoy was the complimentary bread and compound butter (this we also had to ask for as they kept giving them to other tables and guests and always walking past us for some reason). \n\nWhile I am a frequent visitor of the Grounds, I will probably pass on Rats in the future.","2507":"This place is fantastic for a special occasion or fancy evening out! Absolutely gorgeous view out in the back where you can take a nice stroll. \n\nWe were promptly seated and served at 6pm outdoors under a nice heater. The free bread was paired nicely with herb butter, and the rest of our food came out shortly after. My medium rare steak came out closer to being well-done, but the sweet sauce, vegetables, and potato wedges complimented the plate perfectly. \n\nDefinitely consider spending the $$ here and there to treat yourself!","2508":"Thought this place was going to be a lot more expensive but it wasn't. The food was excellent. I don't know why I've never heard of it before.","2509":"Yelp app note - while searching for PARISH on the Yelp app I was directed to THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS as the first search result.  My sinful brothers and sisters - and you know who you are, especially this time of year - please don't mistake one for the other.  They are very...VERY different.\n\nTwice we've been to the Parish and both times we've sat at the bar.  On a Saturday night at about 7:30pm the weekend before X'mas, the place was busy, but there were seats left at the table and a few open at the bar.  \n\nThis is a place that takes its libations seriously.  Mysterious-looking jars of vegetables and fruits labeled clearly (lest you think they're pig fetuses), steeped in alcoholic goodness adorn the bar which looks like it was made with reclaimed wood.  Walls are deep red with black concrete floors.  Entertainment for the night was a man with a guitar and a harmonica (and a woman - though she wasn't attached to his mouthpiece like the harmonica).  The place has undergone a renovation and now resembles a fever dream I might have after too many spicy, deep fried foods and endless glasses of Mississippi moonshine.\n\nThe bar seating area has HOOKS underneath the counter (a nice touch for those of us with an affectation purses larger than our asses).  There were two bartenders -\"bar keeps\" judging by their traditional garb of the jaunty hat, vest and dress shirt - and they never stopped mixing drinks the entire time we were there.\n\nHouse specialty cocktails are a reasonable $8\/each and are comprised of ingredients, such as \"basil-infused\" vodka and lavender somethings.  These people are such purists they even make their own maraschino cherries.  (They'll proudly show you the bottle.)  We had an old fashioned, a gin martini and a Sam Clemens - a house specialty.  The old fashioned was very fragrant (probably made with some specialty bitters), and the rye was proudly shown to be a winner of a competition.  The drinks were not very strong, but just enough to get a buzz going.  The bar keeps are so responsible that they even have business cards for drivers who will drive you home, in case you had one too many and start babbling about a pimple on your chin that is virtually non-existent to the world but has somehow, in your exalted opinion - overtaken your face.  (I'm sorry if my pimple talk ruined everyone's good time.)\n\nFor food, we had the Tchoup (pronounced TCHOWP) - a very large and thick bone-in pork chop with mesquite smoked adobo and tea sauce.  Pork nice and tender, uniformly cooked and well-seasoned despite its size. My dining companion had a fish 'n chips, which he said was pretty good, though the pork was clearly the winner.  We had wanted to stay, and even entertained the idea of dessert, but were scared of what the musician with the harmon-guitar and his sidekick might do, \n\nI can see this place as being on our regular rotation - the vibe is laid-back and the place hip without being pretentious.  The drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders and chef obviously love what they do through the quality of their drinks and food.","2510":"We stopped here for brunch without a reservation on a warm spring Sunday.   After waiting 20 minutes for a table we were seated outside.   This is a great place to eat al fresco with a view of the pond and a couple of bridges and sculptures.\n\nWe ordered the charcuterie which featured house cured meats including pate, prosciutto, and salamis served with rye toasts, grape must, and whole grain mustard.   This was fine but there wasn't much variation in the salamis and the pate was underseasoned.\n\nThe rabbit ragout served over bucatini was flavorful and well balanced.  I would definitely order this again.    The mussels were served with a very rich, buttery broth with thee large toasts for dipping-also very good.\n\nSo the food is good.   Why only three stars, you ask.  The service here stunk from the people at the concierge to the runners.\n\nI went in and was almost run over by a series of waiters while waiting for the folks at the front desk to come to the front to take my name.   This took several minutes of waiting.   No sorry.  Just \"what's your name?\"   I didn't have a reservation.   They told me 1\/2 hour for a table.  So we waited.  No problem.   After 20 minutes, there were plenty of tables free inside but still no seat for us.   Finally they seated us outside which was not my first choice.  Outside there were different waiters for the different tables.   For some reason all other tables around us got served before us before we got our food.  We almost walked out but the manager convinced us otherwise.   Were not sure if we got the B team all around or if this place knows that because of their location at Grounds for Sculpture they have a captive audience.","2511":"Perish the thought of not going to The Parish while we are in Tucson! I had this restaurant bookmarked forever and I figured now was a good time as any to try them out. We placed an order to go. I had the shrimp and grits and shared some pork rinds. Everything was securely packaged for the trip back to our hotel room.\n\nThere was nothing shrimpy about this meal. It was a hefty block of fried grits, with plentiful shrimp, collard greens and coated in sauce. It did require true grit to try to finish everything in one go (I failed at this challenge). Overall, my meal was decent. I liked the greens and the idea of a fried grit cake is unique and was a nice balance of textures from the creamy soft interior and the crispy outer crust. I'm not sure if it was due to transport time but the shrimp was way overcooked by the time I dug into my meal though. \n\nThe pork rinds were light and crispy. I enjoyed the seasoning on it. Next time I get food from here I'm going to try their gumbo!","2512":"I've been to Rat's numerous times over the years and have never been disappointed. We just went for Thanksgiving and were absolutely delighted that they were able to keep the dinner at their usual high quality with the same elegant atmosphere. The courses were tasty and delicious and we couldn't believe the reasonable price for all of the food we received. Going out for dinner on the holiday is usually a mistake but NOT at Rat's, we highly recommend you try it!","2513":"Loved this place! My boyfriend lived in Louisiana for 6 years so he had been looking forward to checking this place out. Restaurant itself is very trendy, well decorated, and clean. All COVID protocols were being followed, social distancing was being enforced, tables spaced out, and all staff members were wearing masks. I didn't catch her name, but our server was very sweet and helpful. Their menu seems to be a bit smaller (which I am sure due to Covid) so they weren't many options for a somewhat picky eater like myself, so I had a burger and a side salad and it was delicious. My salad came with a spicy dressing that was SO GOOD. Salad was super fresh and crisp, and it was huge for a side salad. My boyfriend had the frog legs appetizer to start and loved them, he also had the shrimp po-boy which he said was fantastic. Cocktails were great as well, and they have a really nice looking bar area. We want to go back for happy hour one day and explore more of their menu and cocktails. Really nice place and definitely worth checking out!","2514":"Perfect! Great change up from the usual suspects. Southern inspired restaurant with good food and friendly staff. I had the award winning  Parrish Burger. It was great, from the quality bacon to the onion compote. I paired this with tasty hushpuppies that had the perfect amount of jalape\u00f1o and sweetness. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. Will definitely return.","2515":"Beautiful scenery, delicious food.  The charcuterie selection was amazing. Wait staff could pay a bit more attention but our server was very nice regardless. The hostess was okay, she didn't seem too happy.  Will definitely return based on the food and scenery.","2516":"We were so excited to try this restaurant based on all the great reviews. All I can say is if you don't like loads of spice, stay far far away! \n\nDisappointed as the food had so much potential with what seemed like really fresh ingredients but every single thing we had was painfully spicy. I hate to waste food but we gave up trying to eat it, paid and left; didn't think twice about not getting to go boxes. \n\nThe watermelon salad would have been so tasty, the pork on it was delicious. But whatever was in the dressing literally burned our lips and mouths. \n\nEven the popcorn and fries were covered in pepper. Gave up on the Brussel sprouts as they were way too intense on the spice. \n\nI am totally fine with food having some kick but this was beyond making the food tasty or enjoyable. If you are just dousing your food in heavy spice, what is the point of developing the complex flavors and textures in dishes? \n\nThe restaurant was also very loud, more bar than dining. \n\nWe would not recommend nor return.","2517":"The restaurant is smaller (in size) than I expected, but it's got very cool decor on the inside. My husband likes the artwork and I like the old apothecary looking bar lined with shelves of unique house infused liquors. \n\nWe ate at the bar, which is full service, to avoid having to wait for a table. There are also two big televisions broadcasting the Olympics, which is a nice addition for those interested. The bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nWe got the black and blue brussels sprouts, which were amazing, as well as the oyster and catfish poboy sandwiches. Both were good (huge portions!), but I'd say the catfish was better. The hush puppies were also incredible - crispy in the outside and sweet and chewy on the inside.","2518":"This place fell under the radar for me, but Yelp has its ways!\n \n Ambiance - Lots of space on the inside. It's a bit dim but has a really interesting atmosphere (dark, but lively?). \n \n Service - Efficient and friendly. They were fairly busy for a weekday dinner.\n \n Food - Would pass on the po-boy, but the ruby trout was delicious. The right amount of moistness and flavor. The fries that came with it were delicious as well. Bread pudding was decent, but stand outs were the gumbo off the happy hour and the drinks! \n \nOverall, I'll definitely be back for the drinks and to try more of the happy hour menus! Great place to hang out and catch up with friends.","2519":"We had an unforgettable lunch at Rat's last weekend. We were well taken care of by Jen, our amazing waitress. She was full of helpful suggestions when ordering, and always made sure we had refills. My fianc\u00e9 loved his Rat burger, and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. His burger came with a delicious side of fries and a pickle. For my lunch, I thoroughly enjoyed the turkey and bacon croissant, which came with a small salad. I also had the white sangria, which was on the sweeter side and full of strawberries. We loved our lunch here and it was so nice to be able to dine outside with the breathtaking view of \"Monet's\" bridge and the water. If you plan to go for lunch, make sure you make a reservation as we saw many people being turned away that did not have one.","2520":"We saw this in our local paper and decided to visit the Sculpture Garden and dinner at Rat's. \nThe Sculpture Garden was impressive and worth the trip.  Rat's on the hand was not. The location and the theme is impressive but the food and the service was not. \nOur waitress was friendly but inept. She disappeared on a regular basis for long periods of time. Our order was not correct and they offered to correct but the correction took twenty minutes. \nThe short ribs were tasty but dry.  Dessert was another long wait   The fish was delicious. \nOver all very disappointing!!","2521":"Always drove past this place and finally decided to try it. Delicious comfort food. We had the Beer Battered Catfish and Drunken Angel. It was the perfect amount of food and the catfish was extra crispy. Would recommend if you're in the mood for more hearty upscale southern food.","2522":"The food is delicious and well executed. The wine list is pretty impressive.  Our server was great and attentive.  A wonderful place to eat after a day at the Grounds for sculpture.","2523":"Awesome as usual.  Stephanie, the other managers and staff and Lawson our server are so good.   The food was amazing as usual.  Can't wait for their downtown Delta bar and restaurant to open.","2524":"One of the best meals I have had in a very very long time. I can't wait for work to send me back to Tucson to eat here again. I had the gumbo, lunch size, and it came with hushpuppies. It was amazing and enough that I had the leftovers for dinner. I had the porch lemonade and it was a great cocktail, refreshing and lite. The server was attentive and food came out fast for lunch. Unique quirky restaurant with great atmosphere. It is in a strip mall but don't let that deter you, once inside it is a random uniquely furnished place with lots to look at!","2525":"I was excited to try this place after reading the reviews. We convinced our friends who live on the far east side of town that it would be worth the drive to meet us here. It wasn't.\n\nWe arrived on a Friday night at 5pm and the place was busy. We got the last table available on the patio.  We tell our server that we are hungry but most importantly we are thirsty and when she sees our glasses half empty, to bring us another round!  I would have thought she would have a vision \"Wow, I will be getting a big tip from this table as they are planning on spending $$$ drinking and eating!\" but sorry to say this was not her vision, only our broken dream. We had to flag her down to get drinks, to order food, to order more drinks, to order more food, to order more drinks and more drinks and....well you get the picture.\n\nWe noticed the waitstaff were not wearing uniforms - this really bugs me as when a place is busy, you don't know who works there and who doesn't. Why would a business owner not want their staff to be in a uniform (or uniformally dressed i.e. all in black)?  Geez, it's cheap to at least get t-shirts with your name on them for your employees!  \n\nWe ordered appetizers - hush puppies with crawfish, bacon popcorn, french fries, chicken wings, and the pretzel. The hush puppies were amazing and served with this yummy sauce to dip them in - so far so good!  The french fries were some of the best any of had ever had! The pretzel was just okay, not worth writing home about.  The bacon popcorn was good, not great. The chicken wings were just inedible.\n\nWe ordered our dinners - the guys ordered the fish and chips and the gals ordered the spicy pork sandwich. I chose hush puppies (for $1.00 extra) instead of fries because I loved them so much.  \n\nOur dinners arrive and the first thing we notice is the guys fish & chips plates. None of us have ever been to a restaurant, ordered fish and chips and receive 1 PIECE OF FISH!!!  Come on, 1 piece of fish!!!!!?????  The menu states \"worlds crispiest fish\" and they got that right - this fish was so over cooked that it died several times. We are still shaking our heads over receiving 1 piece of  fish! A friend of mine ate there a week later and had the same thing happen to him so this is their normal portion!\n\nOur pork sandwiches looked and tasted very good.  However, my hush puppies did not have the yummy sauce that we received with the appetizer order of hush puppies. The owner stops by and I inquire about the sauce only to be told \"the sauce only comes with the appetizer order\". I ask if I can have some of the sauce and it seemed to be a big imposition asking for more of this sauce ( must have been a shortage) but several minutes later I did receive a thimble full of sauce. I am happy to have this sauce until we get the bill and WOW - they charged us $2.00 for the thimble of sauce!!!  Are you kidding me??? We had a lot of sauce left over from our appetizer order and had I known that it wouldn't come with my dinner and I would be charged for extra, we would have kept the sauce.","2526":"After trying this gem in a strip mall on with west side of Oracle road, near Orange Grove, it was so good my husband and I returned again for dinner two days later.  On Sunday the small place was elbow to elbow with patrons watching football, on the 6 flat screen TV's behind the beautiful wood bar. Since I don't watch sports I think i'll stick to midweek dining. The first visit we started with sazeracs which were wonderful! So good we both had two rounds. The appeal of this place is the creole dishes on the menu.\n\nThe hushpuppies with crayfish is wonderful! They can be added as a side to any entry for a small charge.\n\nThe \"pit\" flavored hot wings were excellent. Last night I had the Spicy Haitian pulled pork and immediately had a runny nose and a smile on my face. It was pouring rain outside and all my woes were forgotten. My husband loves their gumbo! I had the Big Hippie (eggplant burger) my first visit and it was great. I especially like the buns  on their sandwiches; nice and glossy, buttery toasted before assembling the sandwich. The menu again is pretty limited, with about 6 appetizers, a few salads, a few entries (the Gumbo being one) and about 6 burgers\/hot sandwiches. They  provide the option to make several of the dishes vegetarian, such as their lamb flat bread.  No desserts on the menu, but the owners assured us this will be changing in the new year. I'll keep my eyes open.\n\nI am certain we will be back soon.","2527":"Sooo - I have like 21 check-in's here and just getting around to doing a review.   I admit that I often meet friends at the bar for a 'Prayer Meeting'.  Happy hour is like 3P to 6P M-F.  My favorite at the bar is the Bacon Popcorn.\n\nHowever, we met some friends here for dinner tonight and the food was pretty fabulous.   I have the Shrimp & Grits, Shannan had the Crispy Fish & Chips and JW had the Drunken Angel.  It was just 'Wow'.  So many great tastes that made dinner very enjoyable.  There was nothing (even the Famous Bread Pudding) that wasn't excellent and would re-order them all again.\n\nSunday night has live country music and the guy was really really good.  Definitely a spot to eat dinner in Tucson. \n\nI think the owner won Iron Chef and also participates in the new group of chefs that just hang out called GUT (Gastronomic Union of Tucson) where they experiment and get creative with new dishes.","2528":"Came here for drinks after dinner at Sushi on Oracle, and I was very impressed with their drinks. Well one drink.. I ordered the Georgia ice tea.. and it was very delicious, dangerously so. (Peach vodka, green tea and lemon I believe?) Interior was very beautiful with local art hanging throughout, and bartender was attentive and very funny. All in all a great bar.","2529":"We took our kids to Grounds for Sculpture to close out winter break and made reservations for lunch at Rat's. It exceeded our wildest expectations of a place to grab an elevated lunch while keeping our three kids under 10 engaged (which almost never happens). From the moment we walked in, Sasha, the host, warmly welcomed our family and kids and set the tone for the lunch. Our server, Austin, was incredibly patient with us and our kids and knowledgeable about the menu (I can never make up my mind). As we were leaving, our oldest ask when we could come again!","2530":"Small but fun menu really different from the usual menu.\nRaymond our waiter was very attentive. Nice guy too.  We both had the Parish burger cooked to order and OMG it was delicious.  It was so big I had to take half of mine home. I love the atmosphere just so much color but still relaxing and fun.  Even the hallway to the bathroom is great.   We we come back? Of Course next time we are in Tucson.","2531":"Went with a group of four, EVERYTHING was top notch, including the atmosphere and service. We had the Brussel sprouts and frog legs for apps - they were both out of this world - full of flavor. We had the steak, trout, burger and gumbo for dinner. If it wasn't rude, I would have licked the plate clean because the sauce that comes on the steak is to die for. The gumbo was so flavorful, rich and as you eat it, the flavors build. The trout was excellent, the Chimichurri was one of the best we've ever had. The burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Bottom line - if you like flavorful food, a great atmosphere, and first class service, this is the place for you.","2532":"Friend took us to Rats for dinner.  Since there was a wedding taking over the dining room we ate in the bar which is gorgeous.  Servicemen was excellent.\n\nWe each got a glass of excellent wine from the specials that night and shard a charcuterie board.  Delicious.  Some had the pecan raisin bread and others the baguette.  All were delighted by that and the compound butter.  We were surprised when we were brought popovers which were very good.\n\nFor entrees one person had the delicious hangar steak, one the excellent duck breast, the non gourmet had the chicken but didn't like the glaze.  I had the mussels and fries but the sauce didn't wow me.  We had a side of duck fat potatoes and I thought I went to heaven but my husband didn't like them\n\nThe disappointment was in the desserts and coffee.  The coffee was not worthy of a second cup and the chocolate zucchini cake was not worth the calories.\n\nAll in all a beautiful setting, good food and great service.  My ideal there would to be to go with good friends and share a cheese plate and a charcuterie plate and some good wine.","2533":"When on the NW side of Tucson, you must stop in for some unique cocktails and delicious food. Raymond, our server was fantastic, accommodating, and very friendly. The rest of the staff welcomes you like an old friend.  The food is fast, fresh, and fantastic. The service is tops! We ate their catfish and the Parish burger, both served with the best fries I've ever had. Bold statement, but the fries were great! Prices are good for the Tucson area. Overall, the Parish deserves five-stars, great staff, great food, and tasty cocktails. You will not be disappointed with the NW Tucson eatery!","2534":"Celebrated an anniversary there.I asked for a nice section to sit in but was put into a dark cold corner. Had to cover the floor vents with the menus to keep warm  lol. When we first got there we were hardly greeted by the hostess who then completely forgot to seat us so we waited 20 minutes and she used the excuse \"I think someone else took your reservation\". What? The food was OK but the only thing going for rats is the atmosphere and I would imagine it is 1000 times better when the weather is nice and you can sit by the water and outside on the patio.","2535":"Super great restaurant! The food was great, best tartar sauce I've ever had, and the service was phenomenal! We will definitely go back! Only downside was my husband and I waited over an hour for them to text us for our seat but food was definitely worth the long wait!","2536":"Excellent flavors and seasonings in all their dishes! The pork belly on the water melon salad was like candy.","2537":"Not a fan!  Was looking forward to checking this place out, but now that we have we don't need to return.  Loud inside, hard to have a conversation with each other at the table.  Very dimly light...depending on where your table is located.  Get ready to have your cell phone handy for some light to check the menu and the bill.  \n\nI had the Compressed Watermelon Salad and got the pork belly on the side to give away.  Waaaaaayyyyyy to much vinaigrette tossed into the salad and it was really salty.  The watermelon could have been fresher.  \n\nThe husband had the Drunken Angel and was looking for the crawfish in it....seemed to be only shrimp tossed into his dish.  \n\nOur waiter, was scarce and didn't come around often.  We weren't asked if we would like desert or another drink....we were just given the check.  \n\nAll in all...this place is pricey for what you get.  Been there....done that, no need to go back.","2538":"Amazing ambiance! The goldfish swim in front of you as you view gorgeous foliage. The food was delicious but expensive. We would definitely go again.","2539":"Moved to Tucson about 3 years ago and went here for New Years eve dinner.  Have returned numerous times since. So many good dishes and drinks!  Gumbo, hush puppies, bacon popcorn are just a few of our favorites.","2540":"An New Orleans inspired menu in a suburban strip mall location featuring inspired dish s of an award winning chef.  The menu features a variety of tantalizing dishes from po-boys, shrimp and grits, Angel hair pasta and more.\n\nWe opted to share their special burger and got the hand cut fries for our side. Both were delicious and plenty for lunch.  It's a cool space but with Covid we opted to sit outside on the small patio.  Lots of other yummy sounding items to try next time.","2541":"Super unique decor makes this a fun experience! The bar is neat and you can feel the NOLA-inspired energy in here! Try the Drunken Angel. The flavor of wine in a creamy seafood dish! If you are looking for a super healthy meal, this is definitely not the place. But for a splurge every now and then, there are no regrets! My daughter also got the kids' hot dog and it was huge!","2542":"I was happily surprised with the quality of food at Rat's! We came to celebrate a friend's birthday. They provided complementary madeleines at the end.\n\nThe service was very nice but on the slower side. We were there for 2.5 hours, and it's not like we were particularly slow ourselves. \n\nThe charcuterie board was standard, but good! The escargot was not how I expected it to be served. Flavor was good but the price point is debatable.\n\nOf the 4 entr\u00e9es we ordered (short rib, prime rib, duck breast, hanger steak), the hanger steak and duck breast were the most notable. The hanger steak was perfectly tender. The short rib seemed a bit dry, and the prime rib temperature was not as accurate. \n\nOverall, pretty good flavor. For the price we paid, I did expect a bit more consistency across the board. I'd still recommend trying it out, especially for the beautiful atmosphere being right in Grounds for Sculpture!","2543":"A group of us met here for happy hour and really enjoyed our food and drinks.\n\nWe started out with appetizers: bacon popcorn (did you really go to The Parish if you didn't have the bacon popcorn?), hush puppies, and fries. What a good start to our evening. Out of the three, the fries were a little disappointing because they weren't crisp.\n\nMost of us ended up ordering entr\u00e9es. I had the gumbo, which was excellent. Someone else had the po boy and couldn't stop raving about how good it was.\n\nOur server was outstanding and checked in with us often during our time there.","2544":"I am leaving a second review because I have pictures of some of the food now! Is it is easily my favorite Place to eat i Tucson. There is no other place like it anywhere. I'd like to get the garden district salad with the Green onion vinaigrette and the salad is always so fresh and there's so many different kinds of fluffy fresh green in it. Besides that my favorite dish is the drunken angel which my daughter now loves also. Highly recommend this place.","2545":"Food was great, we had the grits with shrimp and the drunken shrimp. Both meals were amazing. Also had the Brussel spout appetizer and bread pudding for dessert which was also tasty but would have been out of this world if it was covered with vanilla ice cream.... my opinion anyway.","2546":"I have been going there since it opened.\nI will always recommend The Parish for lunch or dinner. Gumbo is delish as are the po boys. My favorite app is the Brussel sprouts, they are sweet and spicy. They have an amazing cocktail menu and a full bar. They can get busy during prime time dining so be sure to get thete early or be ready to wait.","2547":"Fourth visit here, but the first in close to a year. The food was great, as always, I had the drunken angel (again) and my dad had the gumbo, we also shared some cornbread and hush puppies, which were all amazing! The cornbread is unique cause it's made with blue corn and has a cinnamon bourbon butter, the hush puppies are an awesome mix of sweet and spicy, and the drunken angel is really a one of a kind dish with its burgundy angel hair. \n\nAnd our server was Cameron, it was his first day on the floor by himself and he couldn't have done a better job! Service was fantastic and attentive, very friendly, and just a very personable and genuinely awesome guy. Probably the best server I've had here. \n\nCan't wait to come back for the awesome food and the outstanding service.","2548":"It was our first time here! The food was amazing, the ambiance is amazing, service amazing as well. Staff is just as friendly as they are professional, and the views are definitely something to talk about. Cassandra took care of us & she got everything out timely and politely! Thanks again, wish we lived closer so we could return, but it made our trip to NJ pleasant.","2549":"Food and server was amazing!!! Gumbo was amazing. Bacon popcorn was delicious and unique. Butternut squash salad was one of the best salads ever had!!! Salmon salad was good too. Really amazing food!!! Would highly recommend.","2550":"Originally found this place looking for cocktails. The food was a plus. The cocktails were great, lots of infused alcohol. The bartender's were knowledgable and helpful in choosing drinks. The host's were also extremely pleasant and provided efficient service on a busy night. \nAdvice: make a reservation.","2551":"Atmosphere is cool. \n\nFood is okay...I had the shrimp po'boy which was decent. Was kind of unimpressed with the lack of shrimp. French Fries were delicious.\n\nDrinks were amazing. \n\nService was great. \n\nGiving 4 stars because I will return to try different meals.","2552":"Wow !  Fantastic food with a good spicy kick. My order was waiting when I pulled up. DO NOT order without getting the brussel sprout appetizer.  You will thank me.  Also, if you need gluten free food or vegetarian, they will take care of you.  Definitely on our list of restaurants when we come back for vacation.","2553":"Great food, great service! we went on a very busy night but it was still amazing. didnt get a table but sat at the bar and the 2 ladies working there served us with 5 star service with a smile! The frog legs and Brussels were delish, and will be back to try more!!","2554":"Your Johnny Steak and Frites are UNFORGETTABLE. I always split that dish into half when I'm dining there with someone. The gravy you put on the steak and fries are just so stupid good. There are days when your medium rare steak pops up into my mind, I can't stop thinking about it til I finally come to your restaurant to sit at that beautiful bar of yours! Your drinks are impeccable. My favorite is the Front Porch Tea drink! Your food has always been consistent and reliable.  This place really does social-distancing really well. When we sat at the bar, it felt like we owned the whole bar area! You guys are the best.","2555":"First time here and I would never come back again.  I ordered the drunken angel pasta. It was very salty.  The server even tasted the sauce and agreed that the dish is not normal.  Then the second dish came. It was the same.  \nThen I ordered the trout. Fish was ok.  I found something in the rice that came with the trout that looked like a thin long black piece of something. I was so excited to try this place and it was a horrible experience.  But our server Jessye went above and beyond to make this experience somewhat better.","2556":"So nice I had to go twice! They had me at \"bacon popcorn\". C'Mon Somebody, two of my favorite foods TOGETHER !! Both times I went I ordered this and now I don't want popcorn without bacon! The first visit I tried the Mesquite salmon salad with a green onion vinaigrette dressing. The second time I tried the beer battered catfish with fresh cut fries. Cute little spot with a funky NOLA themed decor. The Parish is a solid bet for great eats.","2557":"It is soooo good!! Options for everyone, and plenty you've never thought of, so a must try. Suggest table gets different items so you can all try something different. Their infused alcohol is a specialty there as well. Love this place. Is very busy on the weekends like all places.","2558":"This gem is located right in the middle of the Sculpture grounds. It's scenic and artsy. It's the perfect restaurant for a date, catching up with friends or even just going solo. I love it. It's probably one of my favorite spots in New Jersey. \nIf you're drinking wine, try the cheese plate and charcuterie. Can never go wrong with that! \nI've been here for lunch, dinner and cocktails. I've heard they have breakfast but I've never stopped by that early. \nThe staff know the menu well and come prepared with their personal recommendations. All very friendly! \nThe atmosphere is very relaxed, and cozy-elegant inside. During the day there's a mix of all crowds which is nice. You can find people who dress a bit more casual and lax, and then the ones that dress to the nines for Instagram. I don't think I've seen many children here though in the times I've been...","2559":"Love the Parish!  We just tried their new pick-up service because of COVID-19 restrictions. Ordered on the phone with them directly instead of Door Dash so that more money will go directly to them. It was so easy - they brought it out to our car and all the food was piping hot. Best of all - you CAN ORDER COCKTAILS TO GO!!!  They put a double batch in a sealed mason jar. I got my favorite La Verdad, had half tonight and look forward to finishing the rest tomorrow. \n\nTheir food is delicious. I think the Parish burger is the best in Tucson, hands down. Great fries as well - no anemic undercooked potatoes here. These are golden and crispy with the right amount of salt. My husband loves their gumbo and red beans & rice. \n\nOn top of the delicious food, since we were the first people to order a cocktail to go, they gave us t-shirts!  Class act and so generous at this difficult time especially. We are loyal customers for life.","2560":"My family and I came here after my brother's graduation and this place was unlike any restaurant that I have been to before. The decor is really unique and the atmosphere is cozy and the surrounding area is just simply gorgeous. We took a little tour around, thinking about the possibility of having a family get together here, and we're definitely interested because of how surprising affordable it is for a Sunday night gathering\/event. \nThe menu has fewer options than I was expecting, so it's a little easier to decide what you want. The food was phenomenal and so were the drinks. Their drink options were really interesting and some of the stuff I had never heard of before. I'm not entirely sure I would order the drink with the bacon-wrapped date nut, but there are more yummy drinks to choose from. \nTo experience it, just go there! It's not as snobby as I originally thought. The people that work there were definitely not as pretentious either. After you're done with your food, check out the grounds!","2561":"Visiting from Texas. Even with limited menu due to Covid-19 food was great. Beer selection was great as well. Staff seemed to like their job which always makes a good result for great costumer service.","2562":"yesssssssssssssss. one of my favorite places of all time. so glad i found this spot. shrimp and grits. fries. pulled pork. hush puppies. delicious.","2563":"Delicious food all the way around! My wife and step daughter shared the cornbread appetizer and both loved it. I had the Parish burger and found it to be very flavorful and excellently prepared! We loved the decor and the staff was excellent at good recommendations and overall very friendly. We would definitely visit again if in the area!","2564":"The Johnny's steak and Fritz is one of the best things that you can get in this city. Alabama quail is well done every single time. The crawfish hush puppies hit the spot. Friendly staff and well-balanced drinks. They get busy at times so sometimes there's a wait and so better to reserve if you can even same day. Consistently good and no complaints going there for the last 5 years.","2565":"I've been to New Orleans and lived on the Gulf for a couple of years. I'd missed the spicy seafood and creative venues that I loved out in that part of the country. I was longing for something to fill that void in my life and the Parish, without question, did exactly that.\n\nTheir drink menu is just exceptional and with a variety of very creative house-made spirits  (like cucumber tequila and vanilla ginger rum), you're sure to fall in love with something.\n\nThe food was just Divine. We had the crawfish hush puppies, which were slightly overdone, but the flavor within more than compensated. I suggest pairing them with the house remoulade in place of the included green onion sauce. You'll love it. \n\nMy sister had the fish and chips and it was great.  The cod was very meaty, flaky and juicy with perfectly crisped batter that tasted great.  The fries are to die for (especially when dipped in their fry sauce) and the tartar was very fresh. \n\nI enjoyed the red trout and was equally impressed. The crawfish butter really put it over the top!\n\nWe wanted to try the bread Pudding  (we hear it's amazing) but we were simply too stuffed and couldn't make room.  We will definitely be back for it though!\n\nThat said, if you want a little piece of New Orleans here in Tucson, The Parish is the place to be.  From the delicious food to unique and well-crafted drinks, to the friendly service to the awesome venue, this place is sure to please. Highly recommend.","2566":"Only knocking down a star because when we were there they were understaffed! Otherwise I had a great experience. I had never had New Orleans inspired cuisine, I enjoyed it. The waitress we had was very kind.","2567":"We were intrigued by the reviews.  The New Orleans style is a bit esoteric and definitely different from a typical southwest venue.  The menu is amazing- an interesting blend of southern food with some SW influence. We had to start with bacon popcorn and pork rinds. The popcorn was killer! I had a Honey Hefeweizen and the Hubs had a Bend River Black Currant Cider.  We saw a Smoked Salmon Salad at another table and ordered that. The spicy green onion dressing was perfect with the salmon, greens, pomegranate and jicama.  We also split a Johnny steak, a NY strip with a peppery Johnny Walker sauce over French fries. It was really good, but a little heavy on the sauce.  Maybe ask for it on the side. \n\nI was sad to hear they were out of catfish due to the hurricane but were offering fried tilapia instead. I was also sad that they are no longer serving brunch, because those pics look amazing!  We were too full to get the bread pudding- maybe next time.  Overall, great service!","2568":"I enjoyed this spot SO SO much! I love the spin on some of my southern comfort favorite dishes and their in-house infused cocktails were amazing! The vibe is so cool with the gothic decor and dark art pieces on the walls paired with the rustic and vintage tables and seating was so perfect. Staff was so attentive and food came out hot and fresh! The fried pork skins were still sizzling at the table! My shrimp and grits couldn't have been any better! They were packed with flavor and the way the grits were fried up was a way I never experienced but loved it so much! I can't recommend this place enough for its service, drinks, food and location!","2569":"Rat's Restaurant is located at Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, NJ. Grounds for Sculpture is a gem hidden in an industrial area. The restaurant is beautiful, and was conceptually designed by John Seward Johnson, Jr. with a Claude Monet-styled ambiance. It's named after the character \"Ratty\" from The Wind in the Willows.\n\nMy wife and I are members of Grounds of Sculpture, and as such, receive a 10% off discount at Rat's. In 2020 we visited Rat's a half dozen times. During the warmer months Rat's is the perfect outdoor eating destination. From the covered patio you have an amazing view of the pond, statues, and landscaping. Since Grounds for Sculpture is currently requiring reservations even for members to limit capacity due to COVID-19, you cannot enter the grounds from Rat's or enter Rat's from Grounds from Sculpture. I do miss the days of being able to go for a stroll through Grounds from Sculpture after dinner without having to get in the car and drive to the other parking lot. \n\nThe food and drinks are usually top notch. The menu is French-inspired and typically changes a bit each season. They added a Cheese and Charcuterie appetizer this year which is great because it was always so hard to decide between the cheese or the charcuterie. \n\nThe servers are always very attentive. Rat's has recently added an in-house pastry chef so the desserts have improved. Expect to pay approximately $150 for dinner for two with drinks.","2570":"I very much enjoyed my take-out birthday dinner last night during this 'shelter in place' period. The 'Front Porch Tea' hit the spot and such a cute presentation in it's mason jar. My main course, Guedry's Gumbo  was very tasty, although it could have used a few more pieces of meat. The hushpuppies are the best. And my vegies, Black & Blue Brussels, were yummy. I also purchased a couple of gift cards for another time. Good luck Travis and Parish staff. Hope you can weather this season of insanity so we can continue to enjoy your cookin'. Suzanne G.","2571":"The burgers are definitely big enough for two^^ and the cornbread was so good!! Moist and not too sweet but def filling and a great appetizer to have","2572":"Came here with a group, with reservations, on a weekday afternoon for lunch.  We instantly loved the atmosphere of the restaurant upon entering.  We were seated in a corner booth\/table combo for 7.\n\nOur waiter was kind and polite.  Enjoyed the seasonal High Tea cocktail, which consisted of jasmine tea, gin, lemoncello, and a couple other mix ins.  Half our table ordered the mussels for their entree, while the other half ordered The Burger.  \nEveryone enjoyed their food, though we agreed nothing was extraordinary.\n\nOrdered one scoop each of their ice creams\/sorbets to share among the table, cinnamon doughnuts (like beignets?), plus cappuccinos.  The capps were average, though a couple of the desserts shined--the lavender ice cream and buttermilk ice cream.  Doughnuts were also good, but forgettable.\n\nPrices are slightly higher, but given where we are, the ambience, and the VIEWS here (it's modeled after Monet's waterlillies), we felt it was worth the experience.  I would reccommend Rat's at least once while at the Grounds.","2573":"Excellent spot. Corn bread is very much worth trying. Grilled trout was perfectly cooked. Salads are great. Good service..","2574":"I love grounds for sculpture so when I had a chance to enjoy happy hour at Rats i took advantage of it. We arrived a little before 4 when happy hour started and had no problem getting a seat. \n\nDecor inside looks somewhat Indian with lots of bright colors, silky fabrics and beads. Several tables are surrounded by cloth covered chairs and an area by the fireplace sports large pillows to sit on and a beaded curtain.  Lovely!\n\nThere is a nice happy hour offering mixed drinks with house liquors, decent wine, and I believe beer, although nothing craft.  I ordered the pino noir which I enjoyed.  \n\nWe ordered the roasted brussel sprouts, which were yummy, BBQ sliders (you get 2), and I ordered the burger.  The burger was 6 oz, plenty big enough for a meal.  Two of us shared everything and both walked away satisfied and not broke.\n\nI love the place and am glad we were able to enjoy the happy hour before they ceased having one.  I will definitely be back for lunch and to enjoy the grounds.","2575":"I have been to Rat's quite a few times. It's my favorite place for a beautiful day because they have an incredibly welcome atmosphere and the menu always compliments it. \n\nThe other awesome part about it is that it is attached to a sculpture garden that you can spend an entire afternoon in. My recommendation would be to go to the garden for the afternoon then have a delicious dinner on the patio. Since I have been here it's becoming more popular so be sure to make a reservation online through opentable. \n\nLas time I was here, I ordered the summer squash tarte which was light and refreshing. It was served on a bed of greens and the portion was perfect. I also love lemonade and they always have a seasonal recipe that goes along with the menu on rotation. My group and I finished our meal splitting the chocolate torte which was served with mascarpone and chocolate. SO GOOD. \n\nOverall, this is an awesome day date spot, girls night out, or just a fun lunch area, highly recommended!","2576":"This is one parish I'd gladly attend anytime, not just Sundays or holidays.\n\nI was intrigued to try after seeing many of the amazing photos here on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.\n\nWe started with the Southern Edamame, which isn't as \"Southern\" or flavored as one would assume. Let's be honest though, is edamame ever bad? (NOPE!) I ordered a seasonal cocktail, which was a hot cider type drink and my boyfriend ordered a stout. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Shrimp & Grits. It's accompanied with Bliven's greens (I still don't know exactly what those are) and they were so tasty! They arrived on a hot skillet and were coated in the most delicious dressing\/sauce! The creole sauce was a perfect compliment to the shrimp and grits, and the grits were by far my favorite. I can't wait to go back and order this dish. The BF ordered the Parish burger, which I did not try, but he was really happy with it! I did sample his fries... (yes I am that girl) and they were awesome!\n\nDo not perish from your hunger, just dine at The Parish! \n(would also be a GREAT place for happy hour or drinks, they have infusion liquor which I am dying to try)","2577":"What a Lovely restaurant with unique sculptures all around the property.  The food was good however the atmosphere was the best part for us.","2578":"Travis and the rest of the Team kill it on a daily basis. So happy to have them here in the Old Pueblo","2579":"I was driving through Tucson on my way back to Phoenix and saw all the reviews here and decided to drop by. I wasn't all that hungry so my gf and I shared the drunken angel + hush puppies. \n\nMy oh my oh my, where has this drunken angel pasta been my whole life?! The dish is amazing even though it comes in at $24, but there's a ton of seafood inside and it's definitely worth it! This dish is Angie hair pasta with shrimp, crawfish, lobster north with a saffron red pepper cream sauce and topped with fresh Parmesan. If you've never been here before, start with the drunken angel! We also good a side of the hush puppies which was fried very well with a good crunch and a yummy dipping sauce. \n\nThe Cajun flavors are great here and there's a ton of sea food in every bite. I've never quite had Cajun food that tastes like this before but it is amazing!","2580":"Great service very fast something new and VERY yummy we had the cornbread and Drunken Angel. It was so creamy and cheesy I really recommend it !","2581":"The best restaurant I know of in Tucson. \n\nThe types of live music that I've heard here aren't my style so I do my best to avoid it. \n\nThe food is spectacular and the service is honest and hard working. \n\nThis is the first place I recommend when I'm asked where to eat in Tucson.","2582":"The bacon wrapped frog legs are AMAZING!!! Definitely recommend the fog legs! Very homey New Orleans feel inside too!","2583":"Great food, had the gumbo with shrimp and craw and it was awesome .  neat atmosphere..","2584":"Had a wonderful lunch here today! Our server Amber was excellent! She was friendly, efficient, and professional. The Brussel Sprouts appetizer was incredible and my shrimp and grits was way too good!!! Our group also had red beans and rice and gumbo and everything was fab! Also really liked the cute atmosphere. Don't miss this place!","2585":"One of the best kept secrets of NJ! I think very few people know about this restaurant with a gorgeous view almost right out of Monet's waterlily painting scene, and the selfish me secretly hopes it stays under the radar of the general public. The food can be a hit or miss, but mostly good.....The complimentary bread comes with awesome butter with herb, so simple and yet so good! I wasn't that impressed with my chicken paillard , chicken was not juicy enough but accompaying cous cous was tasty. Mushroom pot au feu was better,  I loved the maitake mushroom in it. Tartine had nice ingredients, grilled shrimp and avocado is a winning combo but the sauce flavor was a bit boring for me, I expected more. The restaurant benefits a lot from this beautiful setting, it's very romantic that you can easily impress your date if you choose this place..... you have the perfect setting! The waitress who served our table was very pleasant and accommodating, she is well trained! \n\nAmbiance : A++\nFood: B+\nService: A","2586":"It's a real pity that the service and ambience are poor as the setting has much promise.  Tonight after visiting Night Forms we decided to eat at Rats.  Cocktails were tasteless and boring to look at, appetisers,  just odd, pre spread foie gras and onion soup with a pinesol flavour.  Nigh on an hours wait for entr\u00e9es, with no offer of a second drink.  Service was non existent.   \n\nNot sure who Rats is intended for but it was a big miss for our family of 4.","2587":"Came to Rat's for Christmas Eve lunch and really enjoyed my meal. First, our server did a fine job, but I was a little surprised by various staff cursing (one of the hostesses said GDI to another hostess right in front of us as they were figuring out our table, and another staff member dropped the F bomb a few feet away from us when we were eating). Not the biggest deal, but kind of brought down the classiness of the place, I think.\n\nAnyway, I got the escargots for an appetizer and it was decent, although pretty filling (and thus a mistake in a day full of food!). For my entree, I decided to get the seafood salad, and I really enjoyed it! Definitely a big hit with me, and while I ended up too full after eating it, I would 100% eat it again :) Beer selection was fine.\n\nOverall, I would definitely consider coming back here, especially since I still need to tour the Sculpture Park!","2588":"The food is not the regular menu i star with the bacon popcorn dat was different but what got my attention was the blue cheese burgers dat was good the different varieties of beers is also good I think","2589":"Wanted to try this place since it's super close to home. Came in on a Saturday around 3 PM and seated ourselves in the bar area. Our waiter came and took our drink order which took longer than normal considering the place wasn't the least bit crowded. I went with the blueberry thyme Rickey which was tasty. For lunch I ordered the gumbo with hush puppies. The portion size was decent but I don't think they put enough gumbo (or andouille sausage) in the plate. The rice is mainly what takes up the dish, bummer. The gumbo had a nice kick to it and I decided the crumble up the hush puppies inside of the dish, delish! My boyfriend went with the fish and chips which he said were tasty and ordered the crawfish hush puppies as an appetizer. Overall the food was good. Spent about $50 for an appetizer\/dinner and drinks (one each) for two.","2590":"I just recently tried out The Parrish last Friday and I am definitely a fan. They have great and reasonably priced appetizers, great beer selection and overall good food. I went on a Friday night with my girlfriend and there was no wait and the wait staff was very nice and accommodating. Just to be sure it would be a place I frequent, I went there again to eat last Sunday afternoon just to make sure they are consistent. Again, had a great overall experience. The drinks (beer or cocktails) are a little too pricey, which is the only reason I gave it four stars vs. five. \n\nOn a separate note, I noticed a few reviews that gave only one or two stars. However as I read the reviews, it seems like those people had expectations of \"more healthy choices\" or \"more gluten free choices\". A big FYI to you: When you go to a Cajun or soul food based restaurants, it is about the taste of the food, not the caloric or gluten content. If you want healthy go to a restaurant that has healthy food. Cajun is not healthy so stop whining about the menu.","2591":"Having lived in the south growing up its hard to find well executed Cajon cuisine.   I had the gumbo. It was great.  The spices were good.  Having a southern palette the spices could been more intense but that would have turned away the less experienced Cajon enthusiast.  The hush puppies were spot on.  Overall a great meal.  My wife had the Drunken Sailor.  She enjoyed her meal as well.  The corn bread and bread pudding were good too.","2592":"Went for lunch on a Saturday.Service was good and was quick.The food was good and they have a decent  selection of beer , wines and cocktails.I had rabbit ragout and enjoyed it thoroughly.The others had a trout special or Cobb salad.Everyone (4 people) was pretty happy.The portions are not real large but quite adequate.The prices aren't low.\n\nI usually don't say much about restaurant appearances because generally I don't care! Here comment is required. This is an unusually pretty place , especially if you get to look out at the pond and the bridge.I was seated indoors looking out and at one point from where I was seated I saw a female Mallard poke it's way through some green vegetation under a big red flower.It was a very amusing sight and I would love to have been able to photograph it.If I had , it would be here.\n\nThis is a legitimate destination restaurant.","2593":"I made a reservation for 9pm on a Friday through open table. When driving to the restaurant we tried to gps and noticed that the hours on google and the website stated the restaurant closes at 9pm. I tried to call to confirm but the prerecording stated to refer to the hours on the website. No one answer the phone. We decided to go elsewhere. Please update hours or have accurate time on open table","2594":"First trip here and well recommended.  I had the fish and chips.  Clearly NOT frozen cooked but FRESH cooked.  Loved it.  My wife had the Gumbo (added crawfish) and she was very delighted.  The bread pudding was to die for!  Complimented by a couple of fresh drinks (Great happy hour BTW) and a wonderful selection of food AND drinks all added to a very nice dining experience.  Pleased, satisfied and WILL return.","2595":"Had a lovely experience at Rat's. I had been to grounded for sculpture but this was my first time eating at Rat's. \n\nWe had initially made a reservation to eat outside but due to our dinner being later in the evening and the seating being by the pond, there were a lot of bugs so we opted to sit inside.  I had a watermelon froz\u00e9 and scallops for my main course. The scallops were served with radishes and bacon over a corn pur\u00e9e. I ate every last bite of my meal so you can say it was delicious! My husband had the short rib and gave it a 5 star rating! \n\nWe definitely hope to be back to check it out for lunch!","2596":"Ive been here a couple times now and the food is pretty good. The first time I had the fish and chips and the second I had the shrimp po'boy which were both delicious. Fish was nice and crispy as well as the chips it came with. Shrimp was nice corn meal fried served on a baguette.   Will definitely be back again as its close by and fair priced. The service is great and the decor is very cool.","2597":"If I was going to comment on atmosphere, it would be the music that caught my attention. Siouxsie and the Banshees, Pogues, and then it was closing time when I assume someone else took over with Van Halen and AC\\DC.  This is definitely someplace I would feel comfortable having a good dinner at the bar.  Favorite food, no doubt their fries.  I ordered the pulled pork and about half way through found myself discarding the bun to eat the pork and slaw with the fries. I'm not the only reviewer to recognize the opportunity for a Poutine on the menu.  Will be back if I find myself in Tucson again.","2598":"This was a very good place. The staff was friendly and helpful, the food good. The seating, however, left something to be desired. The tables along the wall in the front are way too close together.  No oral privacy.\nCould be solved by removing one two seat table and making a bit more room for each remaining.  Had a very noisy 5 person crowd on one side.","2599":"Outstanding Brunch on a Saturday\n\nGreat food, service and atmosphere.  Going on a Saturday was a treat as it was not overly busy.\n\nThe food was excellent, the menu limited but broad and the wine\/beer\/spirit list very good. \n\nWent to Sculpture Grounds afterwards, but was surprised we had to pay full entrance fee of $18 per person.","2600":"Been curious about this place for some time, but reluctant to make the long drive across the whole valley. Very happy we finally made it.\n \nService: very casual\/friendly - our kind of vibe.\n  \nFood: Appetizer - \"Hot Legs Le'Jean\" (bacon-wrapped frog legs). Wow! Moist with a ton of flavor. Meals - \"Drunken Angel\" (seafood pasta) & \"Shrimp & Grits\". Pasta meal, from ingredients, to flavor, to presentation, was perfect - what a delicious dish. The shrimp and grits - 2 items that can be very dicey (preparation  & presentation wise) for a picky eater - my wife LOVED it. (We've never seen grits prepared\/presented this way. After many uninspired run-ins with grits, we were shocked at how good the grits were.)\n\nAtmosphere: the reason for only 4 stars. With a restaurant called \"The Parish\", we expected very lively\/colorful\/boisterous surroundings. Not so. It is loud in there. Otherwise, just dark and fairly generic.\n\nOverall: the food is most important at a restaurant and this food will definitely bring us back for future visits.","2601":"I met with a friend for a birthday dinner here a couple weeks back and had a great experience! Our server's name is Lawson and though he had many tables (on what seemed like a busy Tuesday evening!), he was friendly and attentive. He gave great suggestions and the portions were so plentiful. The flavors were a bit different than I'm used to for the red beans and rice & shrimp and grits but still tasty. The greens were pretty good too. Presentation was a 10\/10, no complaints ! Ohhh and definitely order the hush puppies.. the sauce is amazing ! Same for the fries!","2602":"I am finishing my second glass of wine and feeling inspired to write the review while my seat is still warm.\n\nWhat the heck man. This place is legit. I'm somewhat of a foodie per se, or maybe I just love the combo of amazing atmosphere + good service + even better food. If that's you too, move within walking distance of this restaurant!! I don't particularly care for Tucson but I would come back for The Parish's food.\n\nI live in San Diego and nothing compares to their delish factor.\n\nI got the brussel sprouts and pork belly butternut squash salad. WTF. Foodgasm. The pork belly was crispy and flavorful,  everything was flavorful. I also got the Black Station Malbec based on Alissa's suggestion (my epic server) and she was spot on. It's amazing!! And it was the first time I've ever asked a server for a wine suggestion where they didn't suggest the most expensive glass. I tipped her extra for that.\n\nIf anyone else related to the movie Ratatouille where he had magical fireworks on his pallete when he consumed exceptional flavor combos, this place makes that magic happen.\n\nOh, and pictures don't do the bar justice. It's gorgeous. Come, eat, leave happy and repeat.","2603":"Beautiful place,special atmosphere,romantic surroundings.\nGreat service and elegant foods.","2604":"We took dinner here one night, and it was delicious! We shared an appetizer of chicharrones (menu calls them pork rinds), and it was a very large serving, perfectly crispy with tasty sauce for dipping. I took a drink which is recently back on the menu due to popular request, back porch tea. It is a tasty cocktail that is refreshing and not too sweet (an adult Arnold Palmer). For our main, we shared the drunken Angel, and I think this might be the best shrimp and pasta dish I've ever tried. Portions are large and we munched on leftovers of both dishes the next day. The environment is nice. Inside is clean and airy, but we enjoyed our time dining on the covered patio. The service was friendly and prompt, but I discovered when reviewing my receipt the next day that there must have been a ticket mix up. We were charged for many items which we didn't order, so I returned to the Parish, explained the problem, and they promptly refunded the charges which were in error. This is a great place! They also offer many different sandwiches, salads, and other mains such as steak frites and catfish.","2605":"The good: The food is fantastic.  The chef has won some prizes in local contests and on TV and he deserves them.\n\nThe bad: They have family or other uncaring people working the floor, slowly sauntering to tables, failing to greet customers, taking orders during happy hour and delivering them ages later when the restaurant isn't even 1\/3 full.\n\nOther factors: Parking is plentiful.  So if you don't mind slow service and tableside auctions, come for the food, and stay for the food!\n\nE","2606":"Best place in Tucson by far. Food is amazing. The only issue is waiting time on weekends and Friday. I would recommend going during the week or not at peak times as you can not make reservations and the place is small","2607":"If you haven't visited Grounds for Sculpture yet (beautiful park like setting with acres of amazing art that people ages 1-100 will enjoy!), or if you do and haven't tried Rat's yet.......its a perfect one-two combination ! \n\nI admit, I take my family to Grounds for Sculpture (GFS) quite often but only went to Rats the other day with my wife and what a treat. Spring and Fall make perfect weather for a nice lunch or dinner on the patio. Food is excellent and the servers are friendly and accommodating. The hand cut potato wedges were amazing, seasonal lemonade and sangria were very refreshing. Plus at the end......my wife and I split the chocolate cremeux - perfection !","2608":"Food was so-so. I had chicken, date had a burger. Mine was messy and there wasn't much of it, but the prices were certainly quite high.  Flavors here are not memorable or special, just meh. Food's not going to kill you probably, but it might put you into a coma of blandness.  At least until you get the bill and experience your wtf moment.\n\nThe space is small and cramped and drafty. There was a band in this tiny space so once they started in, it was deafening. Not a place for conversing over your expensive meal. Drinks are nothing special, just standard like anywhere else. \n\nCleanliness doesn't seem to be anyone's priority. Tables are really super close together. \n\nA forced hipster ambiance. Don't be fooled.","2609":"Love. Love. Love.\n\nSeriously. I'm in love with this place. \n\nThey weren't too busy when we went there for dinner, and the service was amazing. Our waitress was very attentive. The food was out of this world. Now, I dont normally get food envy for what other people order. But my boyfriend and his aunt got the Drunken Angel and it was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Thankfully they shared a bit with me! I got the Fish and Chips which were wonderful as well. We also shared fresh oysters and they were very good. They do dollop a little bit of a hot sauce on top which some people may not like (and I'm sure you can ask for it without) but I thought it was very good and the perfect amount.","2610":"My wife really wanted to come here.  The restaurant is nicely decorated inside.  The staff is friendly.  The food is also good.  I ordered The Parish Burger with fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  I really liked the blue cheese crumbles and the crunchiness of the picked red cabbage.  My wife got the gumbo with hush puppies.  She really enjoyed it.  My only complaint was that it took a while to get our food, but it was probably because they were busy.","2611":"Today was my first time at The Parish and I'm so happy I gave it a shot.  I started with a cucumber gin drink off of the menu and it was great, so refreshing!  I ordered the drunken angel pasta dish and it was SO delicious!  One of the best things I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  The place was great and so was the service.  I'll for sure go back.","2612":"Loved this place the food is great I ordered both  the parish burger and the drunken noddles it was so good !","2613":"I have been upstairs for the lunch buffet good but I think  too pricey, even though I didn't pay. Been to the tasting lunch as a guest so I do not know the cost of that though I think it was good, Grounds are beautiful. Area is industrial. But Johnson has done a wonderful idea with the all the displays. I will be going for lunch downstairs one day then I will do an additional post.","2614":"Us foodies never miss a new kid on the block.  Always love to support those who set out to open up a twist on a venue, this being a Sports Bar or the new term\" Gastropub\" that term makes me think you get \"gas\" after dining there.  Not so.  Plenty of spicy dishes so if you are one who is always asking the server \"Is it SPICY\" then don't go to Parish.\n  We went on Sat. Grand Opening Day at about 5.00PM and it was crowded but not overwhelming.  Got a table right away.  With the steady flow of  customers and TV's on you could still hear the  people at your table.  Good acoustics I guess.  The menu is small but some really tasty different dishes.  We ordered the appy of popcorn with bacon bits and garlic.  Yummy good.  Hubby and I shared chicken wings and the Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich with fries.  Everything was tasty and a bit different with the flavors of Louisiana melded into the dishes.  The service was good and being the Grand Opening went smoothly from what i could see.  The owners came over to check to see if we were happy.  Overall, great experience and would certainly go back.  I'm sure we would be on our own.  Most of our friends are the ones who ask if the FOOD IS SPICY.  Yes it most certainly has a kick.  However, no gas, no heartburn.  That's a plus in my book.","2615":"Southern\/ Louisiana Creole cuisine isn't really my thing but after reading about the restaurant, reviewing the menu, and background of the chef --I had to give this place a try.\n\nAtmosphere: I liked the unique decor of the place. There's a stark contrast with the stripe, metallic, pink walls with the vintage, darkness of the bar and pieces of artwork. It's different, but it works. I also love the aesthetic of the pub area and how functional the shelves are. The planetary painting nearby gives a futuristic touch to the antique background. \n\nCuisine: We came a couple of times since the lunch menu differs from brunch. Overall it was a nice experience and I loved the thought and creativity behind it. I still don't think this type of food\/flavor is my go-to type of dish, but I really admire how everything is executed and would still recommend trying The Parish once if you're the area and looking for something a bit more different\/novel.\n\nLunch Menu:  \n1. Guedry's Gumbo & Crawfish Hushpuppies ($9) -  The gumbo was not really my thing due to the flavor and texture, I liked the idea of the hush puppies but personally don't enjoy heavy dough texture. \n\n2. Hot Legs Le' Jean ($10): The frog legs come wrapped in bacon, which was a nice touch. I found them to be a bit dry --possibly because frog legs are rather thin and require an adequate cooking time? Overall, it was reasonably priced and worth a try.\n\n3. Drunken Angel Pasta ($15) - I love the creativity of how the pasta was soaked in wine, rather than using the wine as a sauce. I also appreciated the piece of grilled baguette. I feel that pasta dishes tend to be marked-up (in general) and that the sauce lacked a rich, creamy flavor I'm into but it was still a nice dish and definitely something I'd like to DIY at home. \n \n4. World's Crispiest Fish 'N' Chips ($12) - My significant other enjoyed this dish. \n\nBrunch Menu:\n1. Sweet Blue Cornbread ($7) - Small chunks of cornbread were served in a mug, with a side of honey and buttermilk for dipping. I didn't find this to be a great value and was sad that the bread was super crumbily --but learned from my uncle that this was typical of cornbread texture.\n \n2. Cornmeal Crusted Soft Shelled Crab ($15) - My significant other is super into soft-shelled crab but was not into the flavor --personal preference. \n \n3. Fried Chicken & Waffles ($11) - My brother ordered this dish, I believe he said it was decent. No notable comments. \n\n4. Smoked Cochon Benny ($11) - Although I enjoy biscuits and think that the concept is great --I learned that I prefer regular English muffins for my eggs benedict. The type of flavoring for the sauce and the home-cut style of potatoes weren't my thing but definitely fair for the type of cuisine The Parish offers. \n\nService: The service was great!\n\nAdditional Info: \n1. Their vegetarian option: The Big Hippie Burger ($14)\n2. They offer reservations for parties up to 20 (see website)\n3. Some of the unique art on the walls are for sale\n4. They have live music on Fridays at 9PM\n5. Live music on Sundays from 6-8PM\n6. Brunch is offered on Sundays from 10AM-3PM\n7. Happy Hour is M-F from 3-6PM \n8. Late Night: Thursday - Saturday from 10PM-12AM  \n\nOverall, I agree with other reviews that The Parish is a difficult place to rate since they have an incredible menu, atmosphere, and drinks --but since the Southern\/ Louisiana Creole cuisine offered is not something I particularly enjoy, the food is more a 3\/5 for me personally, but overall, for those are into Southern\/Cajun flavors, it's definitely a place you have to try!","2616":"We visited The County of Southern fusion last night, aka The Parish. We surveyed, we dined and we were converted. \n\nI am a believer in good customer service as an essential part of a dining experience. If it's not, I might as well eat at home. The reason I'm not giving The Parish five stars is because of the unfriendly and cold reception staff. There were three people manning the reception desk last night and they didn't seem very friendly at all. There were two women and one man. The women at least made a feeble attempt to be nice but the guy had a LOOOOOOOONG and sour face the whole time. He didn't greet us or even crack a smile even though his face was the first thing we encountered upon entering the establishment. We also had to pass by  them as we were leaving and, once again, it was a demonstration of aloofness when they bade us farewell with cold silence.\n\nNow, moving onto the positive aspects of our dining experience... the food was otherworldly in its greatness. Every dish we ordered was superb. We started off with the Hot Legs Le Jean aka frog legs wrapped in bacon. Loved the texture and taste! \n\nThe partner-in-dine went with the Alabama Quail and I the Drunken Angel. The partner-in-dine was chirping high praises for the quail which was pan seared then oven roasted, infused with shrimp, andouille and mushroom cornbread stuffing, and topped with Carolina gold sauce. \n\nI became tipsy with ecstasy while devouring my pasta. The Drunken Angel had burgundy angel hair, shrimp, crawfish, lobster broth, in moderately spicy cream sauce. I loved the noodles al dente and the savory cream sauce.\n\nThe partner-in-dine enjoyed his choice libation so much that he went for round two. He claimed that the Dutch Well Water was tangy and zingy at the same time. I was happy with my Tucson Tap Water.\n\nWe saved room for dessert and selected the Peach Cobbler in cast iron pan. It was hot, heavenly and heartwarming! \n\nWe also have to commend our server Jeff who was attentive, friendly and courteous (unlike the cold beings at the reception).","2617":"First off : my wife and I are trying to keep to eating plant-based food. So, when we saw \"vegan option\" as a feature of this rather pricey restaurant, we were encouraged. \nVegans beware, a menu of choices for you is slim to none. Agreed salad, was selected -- but you get that in any steakhouse! There was also a corn chowder as soup du jour. but the choice of vegan entree was only a cauliflower steak. I don't know many people who are going to line up for that! I can't! Like a lot of people, cauliflower attacks my intestines with a vengeance!\nAs a result, a chowder and salad was it for hungry bear, till dinner at home.\nSo, vegans visiting Grounds For Sculpture, in Hamilton NJ need to eat before getting there!","2618":"Went to The Parish for the first time last night. Interesting menu, friendly greeting, prompt and personable service - the waiter was Lawson, and I think he is an asset to the business. \n\nI tried the homemade pork and beans. The beans were wonderful - flavorful and tender. The pork - which was chunks of pork belly - were a little disappointing. Perhaps they were only intended to render up flavor and not be eaten, but that was not what I was expecting. The meat on them was hard to chew, and the fat wasn't tender, either. I would order it again, for the flavor, and just set the pork aside.\n\nOn a brighter note, I was in the mood for dessert and had their bread pudding - a delightful warm square of chocolatey, caramely goodness that I would happily have again, and again, and again.\n\nAll in all, a winner. I will be back to try more.","2619":"I've been here twice now and I can honestly say... I'm a fan! The first time I came was for breakfast and the second time I came for dinner. Both were delicious meals. \nFor dinner I ordered the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend ordered the red trout. The trout was alright but the shrimp and grits were fantastic! I seriously could not stop eating it. The collard greens on the side were good too (just take note they are made with bacon so if you are vegetarian, be careful!). For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was a nice finish to the meal. \nI cannot remember exactly what I ordered for breakfast but I do remember enjoying it. \n\nI have yet to try any of the mixed drinks from their menu but they sound good. Last time I went I got the pinot grigio which I liked. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here.  The food is good!","2620":"This place rocks. Great food, friendly service. \n\nDon't sleep on the bacon popcorn, y'all. It's amazing! Their burgers are some of the best in town and the gumbo is good too. \n\nI can't say I've ever had a bad experience here.","2621":"Spent the weekend in Tucson for my sisters birthday celebration and asked at our resort for recommendations for dinner. We were recommended The Parish and my sister had been wanting to try it because she heard the food was great! My sister is a chef so I wanted to make sure we went somewhere delish! We called ahead but were told no reservation unless our party was more than 7 so we got a Lyft from the resort and headed over. We got there at 8:15, when we went in to put our names in for a table two hostesses said we are no longer taking reservations for the evening. They were both rude, no apology and no explanation.. we asked why and they said our wait is over an hour and we close at 10 so our manager said to no longer take names to be seated. We had 4 women total who clearly would of easily spent over $200 that evening who had been dropped of by a Lyft. It was disappointing to be treated this way. I'm from Phoenix and have never been treated so poorly in an upscale restaurant. We asked if we could go sit at the bar and maybe just wait it out a bit. They said we could go look. When we got to the bar and asked the bar tender if there was a chance reservations might open again or if we could hang at the bar to wait it out.. he acted like he had no idea what was going on in the restaurant at all and like we were putting him out by talking to him. We went outside ordered our Lyft, had a lovely conversation with a couple from Germany and ate dinner at North Italian restaurant where we were treated with respect and served with smiles. Very unfortunate turn of events here and I hope it's not the norm.. great food is one aspect to a great restaurant but to be treated in this manner will ensure I'll never find out. Very disappointed.","2622":"The Parish is a really great spot to relax and eat great food. At the suggestion of my coworkers we decided to meet for lunch and I offered to go earlier to secure a table. \n\nWhen I arrived I was promptly greeted and sat in the bar area. Our party had 13 and they provided a space were we could easily chat with one another. \n\nThe menu has something for everyone and I had a really hard time choosing between the garden district salad and the eggplant burger. Both came highly recommended by my coworkers. I opted for the salad and ordered a clementine cocktail  from the bar which was absolutely delicious. \n\nAfter our orders were taken, we had time to enjoy the atmosphere and each others conversations. Our food arrived promptly and it was delicious. The garden district salad was crisp and the toppings were crunchy. I can honestly say, the food and the service was five star and I haven't stopped raving about the Parish.","2623":"All the pictures of this place were why we came for lunch but none of the things we wanted to try were available on the lunch menu. So that was disappointing. The food was still good. Lots of flavor. The inside is fun and inviting.","2624":"I'm usually not one to give five stars unless completely excellent but this one comes close. It's also that it's the best creole food I've had west of the Mississippi. The dark vibe interior and the wicked cocktails make for a nice date night too. The staff are friendly and helpful and all that's missing is a nice jazz band in the corner!  Hope this place stays in Tucson forever!!","2625":"Ordered the hush puppies to start, and the drunken angel, fried catfish, and backyard burger as entrees. The drunken angel was absolutely the star of the show. The broth was thick, rich, and bursting with seafood flavor. The noodles were well cooked, and chunks of shrimp and crawfish were plentiful. In my opinion the only thing that could have made the dish better would be if the bread included was garlic bread. The fried catfish and the burger were tasty as well. Portions were massive. Service was far above expectations.","2626":"This is more of a I want to impress my date and get something unique type of places. It's also a Ritz Carlton Dove Mountain recommendation for whatever that is worth. \n\nIt's dark in here and too hot during the summer. However, the menu can be exotic. We ordered pigs feet and that was not up my alley. I also got the pasta and it was amazing. \n\nI do remember one waitress was serving every table in the entire restaurant. I do hope that has changed.","2627":"Awesome restaurant with a New Orleans flair. First I recommend getting on the wait list through Yelp while you're en route. Our estimated time was 38-58 minutes and we were seated in exactly 38 minutes. \n\nIt's a low light restaurant with a Bourbon St feel. The current menu is digitally available at the table. \n\nOur server, Lawson (who had a good balance of checking on us, making recommendations, and ensuring we had time to enjoy our meal and company) was knowledgeable and friendly. \n\nI don't normally drink alcoholic beverages so Lawson recommended the Aqua Vita which was mild and minty with a lemonade vibe. My husband ordered the Doctor, a whiskey based drink. Lawson asked if he wanted another while recommending another whiskey based cocktail. My husband went with the recommendation and loved it. \n\nWe had the black and blue brussels (crispy outside, tender inside with a subtle kick) and bacon popcorn as appetizers. I had the red beans and rice with andouille sausage (spicy with a piece of poppyseed cornbread).  My husband had the andouille sausage po boy with double fried fries. Then we finished with bread pudding. All the food was cooked well and intentional with attention to detail. \n\nWe definitely recommend dining at this southern inspired gastropub","2628":"Very good, interesting food in gorgeous, very interesting setting at the beautiful Grounds for Sculpture. High prices but high quality food, service and setting.\n\nSome outdoor seating at a more casual part of Rat's.","2629":"No rats visible, but dead bird on entry walkway; a signal to turnaround and find another place to eat.\nMeal ruined by untrained staff (issues with order taking, serving, refilling beverages, not removing dishes for 30+ minutes when finished or dishes being taken away while eating was in progress; plus interrupting conversations repeatedly).  \nThe food was mediocre at best with most dishes over cooked, tasteless and served cold, especially highly touted signature dish.  \nNoise level high as kids ran through and screamed seemingly endlessly on both levels of restaurant.  \nPayment with Rat's own gift card created major problem and ended up with overcharge.  \nWhen returned home with swan shaped 'doggie bag' found contents smashed together and almost unrecognizable.","2630":"Had a 40 minute wait, that was worth every minute. Had the shrimp and grits. Divine! Will definitely return.","2631":"If you like spicy and expensive this is the place for you. I loved the atmosphere and my cocktail but not so much the food, but the maybe that's just me.","2632":"THE FLAVORS!! What a treat to have The Parish in Tucson. First timers. Checked in on Yelp. Easy, immediate seating. Lawson was our server, cool dude, knows his stuff. He recommended everything we ate from drinks to dessert. Dutch Well Water, hush puppies and grits were the stars of the evening. Great creole atmosphere, made for a fun Wednesday night.","2633":"We started going to The Parish when they first took over the space from Chuy's. It's always one of those places that you can count on to serve delicious food in a laid-back, comfortable atmosphere. While almost everything we had was delicious, I can't, in good conscience, give them a stellar review after tonight's meal. \n\nMy husband ordered the catfish. He's had it before and it's always been perfection. But tonight, it was so salty it was inedible. Everyone at the table tasted it just to see, and yeah, there was nothing good about how over-salted it was. Our server, Lawson, was happy to take it back and get him something else, but by the time we were able to get his attention to do so, we were pretty much finished with the meal. We ended up getting something to go, but we should have just skipped it. While we weren't charged for the inedible catfish, no other attempt was made to compensate us for the issue. I get it, covid, tough times for restaurants and everything, but it was a little disappointing.\n\nOn the plus side, the Brussels sprouts, hush puppies, and drunken angel were all perfect, and the apps came out super fast, which was nice.\n\nWe also liked the ability to use Yelp to get on the waiting list (although the feature to have Yelp tell you when it's time to sign up wasn't useful. If we'd waited until it told us to sign up, we wouldn't have eaten until at least an hour and a half after we intended to. As it was, we got on the waiting list when it said there was a 33 - 48 minute wait, and we ended up waiting over an hour.)","2634":"Absolutely fantastic  meal and then some. FRESHLY prepared everything! The salad with homemade garlic dressing was the start... followed by perfectly grilled trout with seasoned butter over crispy pomme frites!  Then the absolutely absurd rum caramel covered bread pudding!! \n\nLastly... Amber is the bestest bartender\/waitress in the world!","2635":"Great food, creative cocktails, and friendly service!  Good place for celebrating special occasions","2636":"I was so looking forward to eating at The Parish, and experiencing some southern cooking here in Tucson. I forgot southern cooking means \"fried\". One of our party had the gumbo and thought it was too hot\/spicy but good. Another had the pork sandwich with habanero sauce and it was too hot and unfortunately stayed with him for about 8 hours. I had the shrimp Po' boy which was mostly French bread and a few pieces of super fried shrimp. Not great. The red cabbage cole slaw was too vinegary, but the fries were pretty good. The best thing we had was the bread pudding with caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream. The service was pretty good but several mistakes were made on our order. Would I go back? No.","2637":"Visited Rats for the first time and I am in love! Celebrated our engagement and we both loved our meals. I would have given Rats 5 stars but we had to wait a really really long time for our food. Toured the grounds before heading to our reservation. We arrived at 7:45pm and did not leave until 10pm! Not sure if food was delayed bc there was a rehearsal dinner going on at the same time or if they were understaffed. Yes, the meal was expensive however we were already expecting to pay a lot. Hostess and staff were so friendly! We mentioned our recent engagement and they offered us a complimentary glass of champagne each! Drinks were strong but we're not complaining. My steak was probably one of the best and most tender\/soft steak I've ever had! My fianc\u00e9 ordered the seafood risotto and it was so creamy and filled with a variety of seafood. We will definitely be coming back for another special occasion.","2638":"One of my favorite Tucson stores! A taste of home!! Not only is the food outstanding, but the service and ambiance is amazing!","2639":"Wow wow wow, blown away with the pork belly watermelon salad! The drinks are handcrafted and made with care. I was very impressed and will definitely be back next time we're in Tucson - so glad we listened to other yelps!!","2640":"Probably my favorite restaurant along Oracle-every dish I have had is outstanding,  my favorite is the Drunken Angel pasta.   A little pricey, but good sized portions.","2641":"Awesome find on our drive thru Tucson!  Casual setting inside with unique decor.  Food was delicious!  Had the gumbo and Drunken Angel.  Both were hearty with lots of flavor.  The Drunken Angel also had generous portion of shrimp and crawfish.  Other meals looked delicious as we saw them presented to other tables.  Would definitely dine here again when back in town.","2642":"The Parish is my favorite restaurant in the Tucson area. I have tried their bacon popcorn, hush puppies, shrimp and grits, drunken angel and the parish burger. The only thing I wouldn't order again was the parish burger as the blue cheese and mustard mix drowned out every other flavor including the delicious grilled onions.  Their portions are huge and I always wish I had a buddy to share with as I have yet to leave with room for dessert and the bread pudding looks amazing.","2643":"The Parish offers divine cocktails and excellent appetizers along with delicious meals. I went to The Parish for drinks and dinner. I had the following:\n\nDrinks:\nBell's Porter Stout beer\nParishioner cocktail\n\nDinner: \nSlow cooked adobo pork sandwich\n\nI also had several appetizers including oysters, muscles, bacon popcorn and crawfish hush puppies. \n\nI have zero complaints about the Parish, They offer a unique bar menu and although the dinner menu is small, they have great dinner options to choose from. A great restaurant for dinner or for after work drinks and appetizers.","2644":"Awesome awesome awesome! The \"drunkin angel\" is amazing. The dish and chips are very good, I wish they would use Haddock instead of tilapia but this is the west coast. But hands down the best batter I have ever had on the fish and the fries where amazing. Mixed drinks are top notch and they don't skimp on the alcohol, craft beer are great. The music is also great and not to loud. You must try the Crawfish Hushpuppies awesome.","2645":"Looks can be deceiving. This wonderful worldly taste of New Orleans is in a quiet strip center. After having the handmade, still crackling and popping pork rinds, I could not wait for more. Gumbo followed and was so impressed that I came back for drinks around 5:30. Great food and handsomely tattooed staff. I would come here again and again.","2646":"The hippie burger with eggplant patty was not flavored\/seasoned well. The burger would've benefited from more seasoning of the eggplant, a sauce spread on the bun, or a vinaigrette on the veggies. Otherwise, just a standard bun with lettuce tomato onion.","2647":"On recommendation of two different friends, we drove up to The Parish from the east side. Long drive and terrible parking, but So Worth It! The shrimp po' boy was delicious, as were the gumbo and drunken Angel dishes (we all tasted each other's food), and the best hush puppies this side of Georgia. If you get hush puppies, ask for a side of remoulade. You won't be disappointed. If you have to wait for a table, it's worth the wait!","2648":"I am a huge foodie person and got excited when my friend was down to try this place since the menu seemed so good.\n\nCame here last night (Saturday night) around 7:15, it was not crazy busy, but a table had just opened when we walked in. We decided to just order wine instead of drinks, but the drinks did sound amazing. (Next time, will be ordering them for sure!)\n\nWe were tempted to try an appetizer, but decided we should just stick with dinner. We ordered the gumbo and the blue cheese burger. The gumbo was to die for, lots of flavor and decent portion size. The burger was out of this world. We like it medium rare and they cookied it PERFECTLY. It was flavorful, moist, and definitely a good burger. \n\nThe gumbo came with hushpuppies, it was amazing, tons of flavor and not dry AT ALL! Very moist, I could not stop eating them!\n\nOverall, I cannot wait to come back here!","2649":"Amazing food!  Started with the absolute delicious brussel sprouts.  We thought there was no way the main dishes could compare, but they did!  It was all fabulous food!  We will definitely be coming back!","2650":"Omg, I just love this store...the owners name is Debbie and she can educate you on everything in this upscale gift shop!! She is the sweetest!\n\nI came to the store to specifically buy some candy bars that I saw on Facebook. They are perfect for gifting! I found them immediately and was in heaven. Debbie explained them to me and there I went picking and choosing.... I ended up with 15 bars and was happy as a LARK to gift these out! \n\nNeedless to say I went back for another 10 candy bars as I found the bourbon and pecan pie was my favorite and I needed more for myself and others. I'll post a pic and you can see the description of these candy bars!\n\nThank you Debbie for the wonderful customer service and the candy bar you gifted me, I'll be seeing you soon when I need a unique gift!","2651":"Definitely only went here once and it'll be the only time in my life! The food was cold and it was very overpriced for the amount of slop on my plate! Sorry not sorry","2652":"Amazing food! Great service! Very unique food. The drunken angel pasta is the best! This a my go to place for dinner. The food is just amazing every single time","2653":"This is seriously gourmet food in a casual atmosphere. The drunken angel pasta is amazing. The sauce on the steak and frites is seriously addictive. I can taste it now, just thinking about it. Shame it is so far from home so only get to visit occasionally. Amazing food, great service. Yum!","2654":"Honestly, when I went to this restaurant I was expecting a lot better. There is a one page menu with only about 20 options, most of which being some kind of seafood. There is only one burger but you can do a B.Y.O.B. The food isn't that great, and you have to have a reservation to sit anywhere except by the front windows and outside.","2655":"This is easily one of the best restaurants in Tucson!  Everything I've tried has been delicious. Waitstaff is friendly and attentive. This place is so good I drive from Rita Ranch as often as I can just to eat there. You won't be disappointed!","2656":"I have to come back here and try the other items! \nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts, trout, and shrimp and grits.\nBrussel sprouts- delicious, very unique flavors with the pecans and blueberry, yummy blend of sweet and savory \nTrout- I liked that it wasn't overly smoked, the roe and minty sauce complimented the trout really well too. However, the fries were too much, I think a mix of salad and fries would be better. \nShrimp and grits- I loved the crunchy texture and my friend loved the sauce, she literally licked her plate \nI am so surprised that such a food spot exists in Tucson!","2657":"We wanted a nice meal and cocktail before heading back to Phoenix and OH BOY, WE FOUND IT.\n\nWe were seated almost right at our reservation, which was great because they were really busy. There are very interesting paintings on their wall that were fun to discuss. Our server was incredibly helpful, offering suggestions, and explaining some of the items on their menu. \n\nWe ordered the hush puppies because Yelp reviews recommended it, but honestly they were just okay. In fact, I was really wishing we didn't order them at all, but only because I wanted more space in my belly to finish my entr\u00e9e. That entr\u00e9e was the heavenly Drunken Angel.  \n\nThe Drunken Angel has this perfectly thin burgundy angel hair pasta that I adore, topped with full shrimp and crawfish, then covered in shredded parmesan.  It was so entirely creamy and delicious. I wanted to finish the whole thing, but ended up taking half home to eat the next day. \n\nMy boyfriend had the Johnny Steak and Frites. He savored every bite, saying that it was the best steak he's ever had. My son had a hot dog. It was a big ol' fancy sausage on a big ol' fancy bun. He wasn't super hungry at the time, but he ate all of the bread, which was really really good.\n\n10\/10","2658":"The ambiance is exceptional!! Very fun location for a date or quiet evening. They have private dining space for groups as well. Then walking around the property before or after to see all the Art was amazing. The food is good but it's more about the atmosphere.","2659":"Great little restaurant. Very good food. Nice bar area. This place is a definite stop on our travels","2660":"The restaurant is better looking than the food tastes, but unfortunately you can't eat ambiance and decoration. Bread was stale and cold. Almost all of the food that was delivered was colder than the ambient temperature. It was otherwise tasty, and adequate, but not worth the price. $20 for a pretty basic bacon cheeseburger that I can get for $12 anywhere else, and a $20 French Dip with one thin slice of roast beef and what tasted like canned aus jus. The waiter was awesome though so he still got 20% tip from us. It's a shame when you're paying for executive chef quality but receive line cook food. Pay for gourmet, and receive just satisfactory.","2661":"Fantastic!!! I ate the Shrimp and Grits... I was so eager to eat the meal that I forgot to take a photo!!! I cleaned the plate and soaked up the remaining sauce with a side of hush puppies.\n\nFinally some upscale cuisine with great customer service. Sunshine and David were our servers. Great service with a smile!!! Be prepared to spend some money and leave the restaurant with a full belly!!!","2662":"I am sorry, but The Parish is okay at best, food wise.  It is a bit pricey and food adequate but worth top 100 list.  Bartender was friendly, atmosphere was okay.  I can't think of a dozen places better, fabulous food, not so pricey, warm atmosphere.  Sorry Yelp, you missed the call on this one.","2663":"Venue is beautiful- love how you can walk around after dining and also have fun with sculptures placed throughout the venue. It's definitely entertaining- Food tasted delicious as well. All of the dishes I had from there were all very satisfying. I took one star off for cleanliness. I reserved an outdoor table which was a great choice after all but they placed my utensils directly on the glass table without napkins being under it or anything. The table were all glass that's not being sanitized after each party leaves so I felt extremely uncomfortable after seeing that. Our server was a bit too busy and always had to look for him to get his attention. I would recommend this place for post pandemic to be safe.","2664":"Rat's is a hard place to write a review on. After dining there it seems part of what you are paying for is the atmosphere and being able to dine in the restaurant not the quality or taste of the food. If I could, I would give this place 3.5 stars. \n\nI'll start with service. Overall, the staff was generally friendly and courteous. However, they seemed understaffed and everything felt a bit rushed. There also seemed to be a lot of variation between the servers. The table next to us the server spent more time talking about the dishes and food where as our server just seemed to rush through the process. \n\nThe food was what gives them 3-stars. I got the lobster risotto which as of this review is the 2nd most expensive entree on their menu at $36. The lobster tail was good and reasonably sized. My biggest complaint with this entree was the risotto was under cooked and crunchy. I've made risotto at home and it is concerning that they couldn't cook it right.  The other thing I noticed was the lobster tail was piping hot and the risotto was luke warm. My wife got the crab cakes which she really enjoyed and the bite I had was pretty good. Overall, the flavors of both dishes were good and I enjoyed eating them. We ordered dessert getting the baked Alaska and chocolate cremeux. They were both pretty good though they used grand marnier lit on fire to 'caramelize' the meringue but it didn't do a great job of this so it was 'half baked' at best.  \n\nThe atmosphere is really why you'd come to eat here. Despite all the downsides of their food I found it fun to eat here and I find myself wanting to go back again to try other entrees. I'd recommend coming here at least once and making your own opinion of this place. Hopefully they can make the quality of their food more consistent as it seems many people have written reviews saying how much they love this place.","2665":"The reviews were great and while I was a little disappointed that some of the items I read reviews about weren't available I was not disappointed by what I ordered. We had the cornbread and pork rinds as an appetizer. Both were delicious. If you are a fan of pork rinds but never had them served hot and fresh-these are a MUST! We did the reservation here on Yelp and the table was ready just a few minutes after we arrived. Parking is tight bc there are other restaurants in the same strip mall. Dress is super casual which I was happy about. I had the trout with Brussel sprouts-they also brought out collards but they were a little too bitter for me. The trout and Brussel sprouts were delicious. I also had the strawberry mule and it was very refreshing. Service was amazing. I would definitely return when I'm in the area.","2666":"Went here for a birthday night out. If you have a group of 6+ you can reserve their semi private room. We came here around Halloween and the decoration is on point! The food was surprisingly delicious. Give them a try, it was a fun night of drinks and food.","2667":"Amazing food, great staff, and a vibe that can't be beat. If you're looking for the best place in Tucson to chill, eat, and enjoy great food and company, this is the place to be.","2668":"What's not to love about this place.  Loved it.  You had high level Cajun\/French cuisine at an affordable price.  The cornbread we ordered should be on the desert menu, it was so fluffy and so delicious.  I loved me some sweet cornbread.  \n\nThe Drunken Angel and Guedry's Gumbo just hit the spot on a date night after we had come down to Oro Valley to go cycling on the Tucson loop.  The drinks were on point.  \n\nTo add to the epic food, the waitress was a lovely person who checked on us at the almost perfect interval, when we ordered our food she knew exactly where to guide us based on our questions.  Then the food came out fresh and piping hot, which is perfect.","2669":"Great food. Pricey, but it's all good. The location is fantastic. It is easily one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to. Perfect for a date or anniversary or Mother's Day.","2670":"Overall, good place to grab some American cuisine. I had the watermelon salad. While it was wonderful, the heat was a bit surprising. Overall, it was a good lunch place. Burgers looked good! Quick in and out with some interesting items.","2671":"I was ready for some good Cajun food but The Parish disappointed me. The gumbo was a healthy portion but it lacked flavor and I chose not to finish it. The skillet corn bread tasted good but the infused butter must have been in the freezer since even the hot corn bread didn't melt it.  It was a cute place with Victorian styles chandeliers but I cannot recommend their food.","2672":"The drunken angel pasta was absolutely delicious! The crawfish and shrimp were cooked perfect and the sauce was amazing! So glad we found this gem!","2673":"Really great ambience, staff is very memorable and cheerful. But none of this says southern, Cajun or creole. Way to much blue cheese, Ribs, the burger, the peppers.","2674":"Great for our first year wedding anniversary.  Flavor profiles are very innovative and delicious.  The service was very friendly and attentive to us.  Great location too, a beautiful pond and sculptures outside that complete the entire experience.  I highly recommend this restaurant.","2675":"We went there to the happy hour. Snacks and drinks are good. Nice atmosphere, social distance. Great customer service!! We'll come back soon.","2676":"Too difficult making reservations. Too sad!!! The times are very limited. Unfortunately those of us who can not quite navigate and understand the wait list, we are out of luck. Encourage an easier way to make reservations.","2677":"Out of this whole city, this is my favorite restaurant. And that's saying a lot. I eat out a lot and this place just feels like home. The unctuousness of the food and the specials created for one weekend only keep me coming back again and again. My most recent trip was in honor of the return of the compressed watermelon salad. Arugula spring mix topped with fresh blueberries and black raspberries. Compressed watermelon squares, feta cheese, house made. Spicy tamarind dressing and pork belly!  Pork belly chicharron es to be exact!  Luscious pork belly fat and perfectly cook meat surrounded by a crunchy exterior. The melding of fat, salt, acid, spice and fresh produce make this a dish that hits on all cylinders.  When it's available (it's seasonal), I order it every time. The chef also has great entree selections. This visit, we followed the watermelon salad with an order of shrimp and grits and the drunken angel pasta. The shrimp and grits were amazing. The grits were shaped into and fried. It took on an almost polenta like quality. This was topped with perfectly seasoned and cooked shrimp and a Cajun style cream sauce and caviar style mustard. Accompanied by a side of collard green a with bits of meat and an acidity to help cut the richness of the shrimp and grits in between bites. The drunken angel pasta is one of the crown favorites here and never disappoints.   Burgundy flavored angel hair pasta, saffron-red pepper-lobster sauce with crawfish and shrimp. This is heaven in a bite of food!  Perfectly Cajun spiced, the rich ness of the lobster broth and the flavor of those burgundy noodles pair nicely. Chef Travis Peters has a created a classic with Thai dish. He also offers one time only weekend specials. You catch these on The Parish Facebook page. You don't want to miss out. Generally posted around five o'clock in Friday's, some of the latest have been a Nashville got chicken sandwich and smoked pork belly po' boy sandwich. Add this place to your list of must try's and you will not be disappointed. Oh, they also have a bar with plenty of house infused alcohols and delicious cocktail concoctions.","2678":"Pretty cool place. I have to give a huge shout out to the bartenders here - they are awesome!  Fast, easy service with big smiles. They keep on top of your needs and are just top notch!  Now let's move into the dining room where after an hour and half wait we were seated and forgotten about. No waters, no knowledge that we were even a table of 4 waiting to be waited on. Staff wouldn't look you in the eye so you could get their attention. Restaurant was thinning out by this time since it took forever to be seated, so there were no excuses - except for the fact that the waitress that we finally got had many excuses for us. Such poor service - so sad since the bar area is run completely different!  We we got our food and it was okay - very overpriced for what you get. We ordered a drunken angel and a drunken shrimp dish. Portions are small - prices are high!  Menu is limited - which is fine, must be a COVID times menu. Other reviews are outstanding, but I have to go with just average, and the only reason they get average and not low is due to the bartenders!","2679":"Great aesthetic and love the food! I like that they are open for lunch with a smaller menu.\nMy favorites are the goat cheese relleno, hush puppies, cast iron corn bread, shrimp and grits and the drunken angel.","2680":"First of all, what a cool restaurant name and how appropriate for a cajun restaurant! Fun fact, Louisiana is the only US state where political subdivisions are called parishes instead of counties!\n\nI discovered The Parish sometime in 2020 and have been here a handful of times. I primarily did takeout due to the pandemic, so it is hard to comment on the service\/environment. The one time I ate at the restaurant, the service was helpful but slow. I'm not sure if its the norm for this place. However, I did notice that the restaurant and bathrooms are clean, and there is plenty of seating.\n\nFood:\nShrimp & Grits: One of my favorite takes on this Southern dish! The fried outer layer of the grits really adds a nice crunch to the smoothness of grits. In addition, the shrimp and its sauce has nice kick to it, I think this may come from mustard seeds. I also enjoy the collard greens and feel that the addition of pork gives the vegetable side dish a bit of a smokey flavor. The entree is pretty heavy, so I would actually split it in half and pair with a lighter vegetable side or a salad.\nCompressed Watermelon Salad: The different ingredients compliment each other very well. My favorite components of the salad are the tamarind vinaigrette and the pork belly. The tamarind vinaigrette tones down the sweetness of the fruit while the crisp pork belly adds a savory component. One thing I would considered is excluding the candied pecans because I think it doesn't really contribute as much to the dish.\nHushpuppies:  In general, I don't like hushpuppies but these were really flavorful and a bit addictive. \n\nDrinks:\nIntermittently, there will be mocktails on the bar menu. I don't remember which ones I've tried since it changes often, but I will say it is totally worth trying out!\nOverall: Excellent food with authentic cajun flavor. I would recommend this restaurant, but just note the food can be very heavy.","2681":"If Nathan leaves this place, The Parish will definitely suffer. He is an amazing bartender!!\n\nI sat at the bar with a coworker on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night. We ordered bacon popcorn and hushpuppies to start. They were both amazing. Although next time, I might pass on the bacon popcorn because they were a bit hard on the inside and tough to chew. The bacon flavor was definitely spot on, though.\n\nOur drinks were all fantastic. My mule was perfect, and my coworker loved his martinis. They infuse their own liquors, which you will see lining the wall. They have some unique options, so definitely expect good drinks here.\n\nThe side salad was so special and not your standard chopped romaine with some grape tomatoes. You'll see when you get it. The blue cheese dressing was okay... it didn't have the intense blue cheese flavor I was expecting, but it wasn't terrible.\n\nMy pasta dish was so rich and delicious. I wish I could've brought the leftovers back, but alas we were in a hotel. My coworker ordered the chop, which was HUGE. I got to taste a bite, and it was the best tasting chunk of meat I have ever had. The rub and bbq sauce definitely was the star of the show. I would recommend the chop to everyone.\n\nAll in all a fantastic place for dinner, and I can't wait to come back again.","2682":"Great food, great service.  Personable, but edgy wait staff.  Fun with a group.  Patio feels like you are sitting in the parking lot, patio is  not great.   The inside is nice.","2683":"I always enjoy my meals here, so it's about time I write them a good review!\n\nInside there is a warm atmosphere and the staff are friendly-- which is more than many places can say. \n\nThe cocktail list is unique and the drinks are nicely made. I am in love with the drunken angel pasta. Also the hush puppies. \n\nI really appreciate the staffs attention to detail. My boyfriend has a shell fish allergy and they even checked to see if what he ordered were cooked in the same pan as shell fish. \n\nThey also play live music inside occasionally. \n\nI highly recommend this place!","2684":"The Parish has quietly become my favorite place in town. Great cocktails, a decent tap list, and some of the best noshes around. I love the burger. I love the drunken angel. I love the hush puppies. Service has always been great, and we've never had a bad meal. Did I mention they have happy hour? They have happy hour. It's amazing that many don't know about this place. Show someone you love them and take them here.","2685":"I KNOW I KNOW only 2 stars.  I honestly feel that I have had better.  I had ordered the blackened steak salad, it wasn't a salad to me if you call one stalk of lettuce on a slice of tomato and 3 pieces of burnt cold steak that tasted like it was sitting out a salad that's CRAZY.\n\nI'll have to try it again in a future let them fix their kinks, and I can try it again.","2686":"I totally enjoyed my special lunch today with our women's group from our Community. It's such a special treat to go to Rats after strolling through the Grounds of Sculpture. Our waiter attended to our specific dietary needs and got everything right. I enjoyed a glass of Malbec snd had a prime rib steak sandwich with fries which was very flavorful and hearty. We ended with a fresh cup of hot coffee. Loved our afternoon in an uplifting venue.","2687":"Great food. You will not be disappointed! They understand the true Cajun cuisine. Thx","2688":"Just awesome food and wait staff very attentive. Gumbo is full of seafood and flavor. Never was a fan of hush puppies but theirs are great. Drunken angel great flavor and down right yummy.  Nice selection of local beers on tap.","2689":"What a great, funky atmosphere with innovative food and creative cocktails. This was an unexpected spot tucked away in a strip mall in a residential district of Tucson.  I found this on YELP staying just a block away at the local Marriott Towneplace Suites. \n\nThe cocktails were rock solid and perfectly balanced. The Parishioner was perfection (but you'd better love bitterness).  I also loved La Verdad with their house-infused cucumber tequila. I drank every last damn drop.  Wine list is also solid.\n\nFood was mixed.  We agreed that the winning dish was the pecan smoked ruby red trout.  YUM.  If you're looking for the taste of succulent, sweet crawfish in your crawfish hush puppy, better look elsewhere.  This is primarily fried dough (like a hush puppy) with an essence of crawfish.  Ours was overcooked (almost burnt and dry).  We also tried the gumbo, which had some great heat (spice) to it but little depth of flavor.  I'd go back here and try some more stuff in a second!","2690":"A really delightful lunch of branzino, filet mignon sandwich, foie gras, and roast cauliflower (should have gone for the brussel sprouts instead). An outdoor table under a transparent awning that needs desperately to be cleaned. Excellent, attentive, polite service.","2691":"We were disappointed in this place. There's a lot of hype around it so our expectations were high, to be fair. \n\nFirst the good. Once you get past the strip mall issue, the inside was interesting. Dimly lit , New Orleans feel with textures and a wall of cartoon portraits, funky lighting, decor and a really fun and funky alcove for private parties. The burger and hush puppies were tasty. They have a waitlist and this worked out well. \n\nNow the bad. The drinks were genuinely terrible. They have a short NOLA themed beer list We ordered two beers to start.,We love beer. All kinds of beer. These were undrinkable,, both. Seriously bad. I thought maybe the lines were foul because neither really tasted like beer. They were WAY too cold, and sharp and micro carbonated. Nothing smooth there. My husband powered through his and hated it. We were thirsty and water was slow coming. He didn't send it back because I beat him to it with mine. I then ordered an 11 or 13 dollar Parishoner house specialty drink in its place. This was horrible too. Tasted like grapefruit juice. The balance was all off. and it too was over chilled . \n\nThey were out of catfish at 530pm. The food we ordered had some great flavor. Yet, the spices were off. Red beans and rice with Andouille had potential if not for the overkill on pepper that made the other flavors hard to decipher and meld or remain  with you. The sausage casing was so chewy and thick that it was a choking concern.  It was hard to get through with your cutting teeth or molars. It took real designated and distracting effort to not choke on it even after sausages cut up more separately. I think they must do the Heimlich there more often then most places. I had to take it away from my mom and remove the skin because she had dentures. We all tried some, no one finished a piece because of this. The prices were hefty for the top items. I'm grateful that we didn't pay for anything at the higher price range now. My husband, a seasoned NOLA foodie had the gumbo. Again, great authentic rich  flavor, yet spice overkill to where it overpowered the potential flavors and killed the end taste.  At that point, we just said everything was great when we rarely saw our server. Not his fault it wasn't. We told them it was our sons birthday ahead of time and at dinner . They ignored that and never offered dessert before dropping off the check after a very long delay.  This place was remarkably loud. Not great for people with hearing issues.\n\nWe felt a bit angst after leaving. Not relaxing or conversational. I don't get the hype. Aside from the unique theme ( which is quite nice and would work if the food and drinks were spot on or if there was some music or something to make not hearing one another worthwhile) There's much better much more affordable in town imo. \n\nI don't think we are going back here.","2692":"The 4 stars are for the atmosphere and the creme brulee. I had the turkey Croissant and it was okay. The brussel sprouts were also okay, but not something I would order again. My friend reported that he enjoyed his salad, but since he was able to eat half of my sandwich (which I was perfectly fine with because nothing about the sandwich made me desire to eat more than half), I don't think sufficient food was provided to satisfy hunger pains. \n\nGiven how pricey the food is, I assumed the food would be crafted in a manor that is more than average, but the creme brulee was very enjoyable and the atmosphere is absolutely beautiful and comfortable enough to make me want to come back again .... for a drink and a creme brulee.","2693":"Haven't been here in quite a few years so we were looking forward to what had been some great meals in the past. Unfortunately this was not to be. Appetizers were generally good to excellent. My foie gras was excellent as were the two apps my sons ordered (bone marrow for one and French Onion soup for the other). My wife ordered the spiced pear and fris\u00e9e salad which was OK as the pears were heavily spiced and the burrata was too cold and thus tasteless. Entrees were a big miss. Pasta dish was so garlicky and salty that it was inedible. I ordered the hangar steak which was tough and consisted of only a few slices of beef. The plating was terrible for the steak, served with a few sad looking potatoes and green beans. The two sides we ordered (Brussels sprouts and squash) were underdone and uninspired. Overall the restaurant feels tired and dated.","2694":"I had a fabulous lunch here the other day - a great wine list, yummy sandwiches and a little something for everyone. The staff was friendly, the overall atmosphere was casual chic and it was a bit of a ways down State Street away from the crowded shops. I had a great time and would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Santa Barbara.","2695":"First time at Jane.  All I can say is AMAZING!!  Our waitress, Mariah, was great, attentive, polite, and gave great suggestions, one of which was the appetizer.  A plate full of deliciousness, baby scallops on a plate with pesto sauce, fresh mozzarella, slices of tomatoe and avocado.  The scallops were to cooked to perfection.  My husband ordered the Texas burger and said it was the best burger he'd had in a long time.  I ordered the chicken and fried Brie sandwich and it was to die for.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and caramelized onions on the sandwich put the sandwich over the top.  Yummmmmm!!  We also ordered dessert.  I had the coconut cake, my husband ordered the lemon tart and I must say the coconut cake was delicious but after trying his lemon tart I would have preferred that, just my personal taste.  All in all, this was the best meal we had here in Santa Barbara on our four-day stay!","2696":"10\/15\/2011\n\nService kind and prompt. Food very tasty.  Consilience wine offering (Syrah) was very good.","2697":"Chicken piccata was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it. Ordered coconut cake to go - so glad I did.","2698":"Delicious. The calamari was excellent and our meals were also great. Beautiful atmosphere, too.","2699":"Quiet and cozy with really good food.\nI got the chicken and brie sandwich which was delicious, and not at all greasy (tough call for a meal thats basically meat and cheese on bread!) And my wife got the fish sandwich which I was assured was excellent. we shared fries which were super crispy and nicely seasoned. \nGood service by friendly staff.\nNo complaints at all","2700":"Jane has a wonderful ambiance and great food. The chicken piccata is a MUST along with their coconut cake.... I am salivating thinking about it. My significant other ordered the steak special as his entree- that was spectacular. The calamari is lightly breaded and the chipotle ketchup sauce is really good. I'm definitely coming back to this place.","2701":"I heard great things about this place but really was not impressed at all. Our server was very distant. She was not attentive or socialable. She had the host explain the specials to us. Also the duck entree was on the list of specials but was the same price and presentation as the duck entree not on special. The presentation of the duck and lamb entree was very nice , however the flavor profiles were lacking. The duck was not cooked to perfection (medium rare) as duck should always be. The potatoes au graten were absolutely delicious. I was disappointed that we were charged a $20 corkage fee when 3 out of four of us work in the restaurant and wine industry locally and brought in a local wine. We brought it up to our server and our server told us that the manager did not want to waive our corkage fee. Beautiful and warming ambiance and food presentation is impressive,  but if you are looking for an experience to include impeccable service and savory food, this is not the place. Management needs to work on some kinks here.","2702":"A wonderful evening. Great food, fair prices and great service. Our  server, Lindsay, was so patient with a table full of patrons with food allergies and odd preferences. She went out of her way to make sure we were all happy and satisfied. We all would highly recommend this restaurant.  This place was referred to us but this was our first time coming.","2703":"Having been a long time Montecito Cafe fan,we tried Jane.\nPromptly seated,,homemade bread,drinks etc.Always ordered goat cheese pancakes,\noutstanding! Reading yelp reviews,tried the chicken piccata,not disappointed, best I've ever had! The atmosphere reminds me of Cafes in France. Again reading yelp reviews we ordered the coconut cake,fell a little short to me.Service was spot on! We will be back for sure.","2704":"Rented the upper room for a small wedding party on a Friday night after our ceremony at the SB Courthouse (it is awesome). Jane has always been on our list of places to try and after calling around we decided this was the best place for us and our budget. We were not disappointed. The staff is extremely accommodating, helpful, and provided us with several very flexible farm-to-table options for our menus. Each guest was able to choose from the menu we defined at the time of the meal, so there is no need for individuals to select items months before. The upstairs room is fantastic and private. It can get a bit noisy if the restaurant below is full, but there are heavy curtains to pull closed that help reduce the sound. But I think they pulled the curtains closed as our party probably made more noise than anyone - and we were early to start and last to leave! Everyone raved about the quality of the food which was notably fresh and well prepared, even for a large party. Our selections included filet mignon, salmon on a cedar plank, veal scaloppini, and seafood pasta. One thing to note is that they did not allow us to bring any food or beverage items in, but the wine selection is very good particularly with local wineries, and reasonably priced, and the wine glasses were never empty. Be sure to leave room for desert - the coconut cake is amaaaaazing.  It's multi-tier, has the coconut shavings on the sides and you get to swirl it into a milky anglaise and its just divine. We are so happy we landed on this terrific restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful evening of great food, beverages and outstanding service!","2705":"came here for lunch after seeing the high rating but the food was pretty disappointing. \nthe restaurant itself was very cute and quaint. the service was great.\nhowever, the food didn't impress me. the menu itself wasn't exciting.  \nfirst, the bread just didn't taste good. it was tough and chewy in a bad way.\ni got an omelette and the eggs were way overcooked. the smoked salmon inside was way too salty. the fries looked good but were not crisp enough.","2706":"It's odd to go into a sister restaurant (Montecito Inn restaurant) and realize that a big portion of the menu is identical to the original restaurant. I would think that if you're going to have a different identity\/name then your menu would differ. Am I wrong? \n\nNonetheless, I've enjoyed what I've had there. My two favorite dishes are the chicken picatta and the fettucine & chicken pasta bowl (Dried Tomatoes, Garlic, Mushrooms, Basil & Cream). And the coconut cake is DELICIOUS!! I'm rarely sold on getting a slice of cake at a restaurant but it takes a lot of will power to not order it. \n\nStaff is friendly, service is great. The odd thing is that there was a time when I would hear their name thrown around when friends would discuss their weekend plans. Now I never do. Sometimes I forget that it's there. Though the food is good I never think OMG THIS IS GOOD! I do at other restaurants that are also more affordable and with more of an ambience that I enjoy. \n\nIf a friend asks me to go to a dinner here I'll go happily but first I'd probably throw out some other names to see if they'd change their minds.","2707":"Such a find!  We were looking for a good lunch for our first meal in Santa Barbara and we were famished.  The desk personal at our hotel recommended Jane and it was a GEM.  \n\nWe were the first ones seated for lunch so we had the pick of the place and requested to sit upstairs on the balcony to enjoy the weather and sites.  Our server was knowledgeable about the wine selection and was able to suggest a local \"buttery\" chardonnay at our request (While this style has fallen out of favor, but it sounded so delicious with our meal choices and we were pleased that our server could accommodate our request).  It was served at the perfectly chilled temperature.  \n\nWe started with the gorgonzola salad.  The kitchen split the salad for us without charge.  It was delicious.  We also ordered the chicken picatta at other yelper's suggestion and we were NOT disappointed.  Again, the plates were split in the kitchen allowing for a beautiful presentation and less mess table side.  The chicken was perfectly cooked with a delightful golden crust and dressed in a buttery, lemony, caper sauce that was light, yet rich and flavorful.  The au gratin potatoes were like nothing I've ever tasted and I still dream about them, (really).  The entree also include saut\u00e9ed squash and snow peas that were cooked to an al dente perfection.\n\nThroughout the meal the waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  Our server even gave us a hand written list of nearby tasting rooms that she personally recommended.\n\nJane set the bar very high for the rest of our trip and while we had some amazing meals in SB, our conversations always returned to Jane and how it was a delightful and perfect start to a wonderful trip.","2708":"I went to Jane for the first time not too long ago for a date night, and it was really delightful! The food was great, and the Sangria was tasty. It felt warm and welcoming inside, and we got really great service. We split two appetizers, the \"pots\" of eggplant pate and olive tapenade and the goat cheese pancakes with smoked salmon. The eggplant and olive were great, and tasted very good although i'm not sure the goat cheese pancakes with smoked salmon is something i'd personally get again, my date really liked them though and it wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't something I really liked. We also split the veal, as the entree which was very tender and delicious. We also got the coconut cake for dessert, which was heavenly. \n\nIn total, we ended up getting two appetizers, splitting an entree and a dessert, and also ordered two glasses of sangria, and our total came out to be around $70, which really surprised me (in a good way). Great quality food in a fantastic environment, I definitely look forward to coming back.","2709":"Went here for my birthday dinner on vacation. We were looking for a nice atmosphere and good food.  We received both amazing service and meals!! Our waitresses were sweet and friendly, even put a candle in our creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! We ordered Cesar salad with salmon and the cowboy burger. Both incredible! Highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!","2710":"Awesome lunch! Just as advertised, the salads were great! I had a chicken Avacado salad, my hubby had a seafood salad & my son had the naan salmon sandwich - each perfect! Service was friendly, casual but attentive - loved the whole experience!","2711":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. The dishes were a little ok the small side but all tasted really good. Would definitely recommend the coconut shrimp for the appetizer!","2712":"I absolutely LOVE Jane! I have had both dinner and lunch here several times and I am impressed each and every visit. It's a great place for a romantic date, special occasion or night out with friends. Wonderful ambiance, friendly staff and delicious food...what could be better. I have tried most things on the menu and EVERYTHING is superb. The prices are very reasonable especially for the quality of the dishes. For the coconut fans the coconut cake for dessert is a must. I can't wait to go back soon :)","2713":"Food took forever. Was cold when it came out. My salad had 2 tangerine slices on it. Never coming back here again.","2714":"This was a very disappointing dining experience.  There is no music and little ambience.  I had heard good things but it was average and boring.","2715":"thanks to the crew at jane, we had our first full family dinner in a couple of years. 12 of us sat down, thank you very much, and it was memorable. food is always yummy, and service with a smile.","2716":"Lovely place, especially second story balcony. Fine burger excellent fries and pyramid hef.  Only mark off was waitress who kept forgetting I was here.  Look forward to trying more on the menu.","2717":"I've been to Jane 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  The first time was dinner and drinks with girlfriends on a Friday night.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Jane was owned by the same owners as the Montecito Cafe - I fell in love with the mixed greens, apple fritter and fried brie salad there, then stopped going when they took it off the menu.  Jane offers this same salad as an appetizer salad, but they will super size it to a salad bowl size if you ask (double brownie points from me!).\n\nI have had the following dishes at Jane (in order of yumminess):\n1) Mixed greens, apple fritters & fried brie salad\n2) Flatbread with shrimp and lime cream sauce (appetizer)\n3) Red rings (appetizer)\n4) Grilled chicken entree\n5) Romaine salad w\/grilled chicken salad, tomatoes, bacon, avo & gorgonzola (with a vinagrette dressing)\n6) Linguine with cream sauce\n\nFor dessert:\n1) Coconut cake with creme anglese sauce\n2) Creme brulee\n\nI highly recommend the fume blanc for wine.\n\nThe service has been great all 3 times that I've been there - the staff is very attentive and super friendly.  My hubby and I will definitely be back again.\n\nOne thing to note: the lunch menu does not have some items from the dinner menu.","2718":"What really helps make a restaurant go from pretty good to amazing is the service. Our waiter was AMAZING. For my mom's birthday last year, I took her and my dad (couldn't really leave him behind could I?) on a wine tour in Santa Barbara and afterwards, we went to Jane for dinner. \n\nThe food was incredible. I don't know if it was because we might have still been a bit buzzed from all the wine and so everything tasted so much better, but we didn't leave anything on our plates. We had their firestone onion rings, which were crispy and delicious. As for dinner, I had the veal marsala, which was flavorful, delicious, juicy, just mmmm. My mom had the chicken piccata, which she really enjoyed, and my dad just had the grilled chicken. We didn't have anything for dessert since by then we were absolutely stuffed, plus we did have a birthday cake waiting at home for my mom to cut into. However, since when I made the reservations, I specified that it was for my mom's birthday, our server came and brought out an ice cream cone with a little candle on top to give to my mom and we all thought that was so adorable. He totally won us over with that and pretty much got us to be guaranteed future patrons next time we mosey on over to Santa Barbara.","2719":"Very much enjoyed our dining experience at Jane. The server made wonderful suggestions of their standout dishes-Chicken Piccata and Mixed Seafood Stew. Both were very flavorful and well executed dishes. Also, enjoyed the coconut cake for desert. Not sure if they except reservations, but try to snag a table on the upstairs balcony.","2720":"My husband & I went here for our 2nd anniversary. It was a quiet Monday night. The service was friendly & the food was good. I wasn't particularly amazed with any of the dishes we ordered but it was good enough to make me want to come back to try out some of the other options.","2721":"Was recommended by my cousin to try out this place when visitng santa barbara. The portion were decent and pretty tasty. The customer service was great. They were very attentative and was always asking if we were doing good. \n\nI got the halibut with citus butter which was a special because they did not have the sole. It was good and very tasty.  We also got the mixed fresh seafood penne. The flavor was good. I would definitely come back and try other food they have when im back in santa barbara.","2722":"Great Restaurant in the heart of downtown!\n\nWe recently attended a rehearsal dinner here over the weekend. A quaint restaurant, which can get VERY loud! The large parties are seated upstairs with their own private bathroom. We had a prix fixed menu but it was great! I started with their butternut squash soup...YUM! For my entree, I had the steak. For large parties, they tend to cook them more medium rare so I did have to request a little longer for me. Just keep that in mind.My boyfriend had the duck and raved about it for days! The dessert was just as yummy...tiramisu! \n\nOnly downside, there was no elevator. I had my daughter's stroller, which they politely stowed away for us. But also something to keep in mind. All in all, it was a wonderful dinner and we would definitely come back.","2723":"Lamb sausage fettucini was amazing. Great atmosphere and service.","2724":"Rating based on lunch only.\nExcellent selection of entree salads. Steak salad was subpar due to mediocre freshness of the greens, lamb sausage salad was good and grilled shrimp\/ahi salad quite good - large, butterflied shrimp grilled to perfection and fairly decent tuna.\nSlightly put off by a small percentage of the mixed greens which were brown and wilted. Would give 3.5 stars if I could. I would come back.","2725":"The staff at Jane were fantastic, food was good and we just loved sitting near the fire place.\n\nI think this may have been mentioned in another review but you MUST try the coconut cake .... It is out of this world.","2726":"Nice service, lovely atmosphere. have to echo the others and say the chicken piccatta was amazing. Also suggest the planked salmon, with the HUGE creme brulee or the sundae (home-made toffee chips).","2727":"My family and I were having a wonderful dinner at Jane until management decided to allow a homeless woman (complete with her suitcase and bedroll) to have dinner at the table next to us. While their charity is applaudable, subjecting my family and I to the direct verbal abuse that ensued is inexcusable. Worse, though, was the simple response from management of \"I'm sorry for your experience- I was hesitant to seat her.\" Unfortunately it takes a bit more than 'sorry' to compensate for a $150 meal that was rushed through in order to flee the obscenities directed at my family and I.","2728":"Such a cute local business. Jane offers an atmosphere romantic and casual enough to suit either needs. \nThe food here is wonderful! So far I have tried the El Mach Burger, and Avo B.L Double T. The burger was so juicy and cooked to perfection with flavors pouring out from the pasilla chili's. The sandwich was also delicious, but I altered it and added some sun-dried tomato aioli, it came out quite delicious. Lunch here is simple, and packs many flavors. You will not be disappointed. ALSO, ask for their chipotle catsup if you like a spicy kick to your french-fries. \nAs for dinner, I have tried the Grilled Chicken Breast accompanied with a tomato cream and some chili's again. IT is a fabulous dish, but I have to hand it to them for their Chicken Piccata! Their piccata sauce is to a T! A perfect blend of buttery-ness and lemon! It has me coming back for date nights in the future.\n\nPLEASE visit Jane if you are a tourist or a local! \n\nAND do not forget to try out the Coconut Cake for a special treat ;)","2729":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in California. The food is beyond wonderful. I can't say enough about how good the food is. They don't try to be terribly fancy, they just execute flawlessly. I had the seafood stew and an appetizer that had grilled prawns with polenta. Both were outstanding.\n\nThe service is also wonderful. You feel very taken care of, but they're not intrusive.\n\nIf you can only eat in one place in Santa Barbara, make it here. If you're going to try for dinner, you'll probably need a reservation. Their reputation is well known and they are busy.","2730":"It's been a while since I went here, but I remember I got one of their pastas and it was really good, but not stellar. They definitely have good quality food but personally, I don't think it stands out that much. It is very good though, just maybe a little overpriced. I do hear their lunch menu is more affordable, so maybe go for lunch instead of dinner.","2731":"Such a cute spot for a date especially if you get a seat upstairs overlooking the restaurant but I only came here for dessert and was not impressed by the highly complimented coconut cake. \n\nI'll give 1 star for the cake and 4 stars for the ambiance. The coconut cake was quite bland and not as moist as I would like. The frosting was not overly sweet but didn't have much flavor. No idea why the cake popped up as a highlight of this restaurant but I'd love to come back and try their savory menu.","2732":"I really like this place. For a nice date weekend away from home, we had such a nice romantic meal here. It really put a cherry on top of the vacation.\n\nFood was excellent, staff were perfect, atmosphere was out of a movie, and my lady loved the coconut cake\/pie at the end.\n\nThe chicken was just right with a lovely sauce. I had a burger (not what I planned on having in such a romantic restaurant) that was excellent. The wine was perfect for the meal although I forget what we drank.\n\nThis is going to be one of the places I visit every time I get to SB. I used to live there for many years and this is one of the 4 or 5 places I really like.","2733":"We had dinner here last night. I really enjoyed the ambiance - it is cozy but at the same time very hip.  We started with the red rings and the goat cheese pancakes with smoked salmon. I absolutely loved the goat cheese cakes and I liked the red rings but eating more than two of that greasy goodness is out of the question.  My husband ordered the filet mignon as his entree and I had the flatiron NY steak.  Neither of us had had red meat in a few weeks so these dishes really scratched where we itched.  I think his was better - mine was just a tad on the tough side.  For dessert, we devoured the pecan tartlet.  It was a busy night for Jane, as there was a concert at the theater across the street (the Granada), but the service was pretty good.  I would go back, I want to try the fried brie and apple fritter salad next time.","2734":"Went here on a Tuesday night with my office department when we were in town for a planning off-site (a group of 11). \n\nShared the Appetizers: \n- calamari = standard, still good\n- fire stone red rings = good but greasy \n- *didn't get to try one, but my coworkers ate the coconut shrimp. They had positive feedback (too bad there were only 5 or 6 on the plate). \n\nMain course - I was really craving a burger that night and had the Classic Cheese Burger. The server recommended it, said it was juicy and best around the area... It was okay for me. BIG definitely (only finished half). \n\nGreat wine selection. \n\nShared Dessert (everything, really sweet for my palate, but good and plenty): \n- coconut cake\n- chocolate cake \n\nService = fine and nice, but seemed to stop checking in on us toward the end (my water glass was empty for what felt like 15-20 minutes before I was able to get another refill). \n\nOverall, nice ambiance, great interior, accommodating with the reservation for my group same day.","2735":"My wife and I have been here twice and both times the service and food have been superb! If there's a show going on at either the Arlington Theater or Granada Theater make a reservation.","2736":"Great food awesome steak sandwich and better pasta. Seated us without reservation. Service was just a tad slow. Highly recommend","2737":"Truly a special find. \n\nExcellent food and excellent staff. The decor is comfortable and makes you want to stay all night! Try sitting outside on the porch upstairs. Great view of a beautiful city! \n\nThe food was fresh and so good! For dessert you have to try the coconut cake. WOW! It's a big piece and can share it easily (get your own!). \n\nNever had a bad meal! Great place to relax and have an enjoyable meal.","2738":"What an awesome place. The food was fantastic, the service top notch and the owner \"Jane\" was so sweet and unassuming. I will definitely be back for lunch very soon.","2739":"Decided to come up to Santa Barbara for the day (easy to do from where I live), and our first stop was this lovely restaurant.  I fell in love with the d\u00e9cor and ambience... there was a very comfortable, homey vibe to it, and I loved gazing up to seeing like a balcony of tables upstairs.  It's just really cool looking.\n\nAs for the food, really tasty, fresh ingredients, and they have one of the most unique and varied listing of salads....... so many to choose from.  They also had a very nice selection of sandwiches and burgers, too....... not to mention pasta.  I had trouble choosing, but my selection was their Greek salad...... all because of \"lamb sausage\" as one of the ingredients.  It just sounded good, and when I asked the waitress, her face lit up with enthusiasm.  That's all I needed to see.  My husband ordered the gorgonzola salad, and my daughter ordered the chicken, mushroom and sundried tomato pasta.  We all ordered a cup of their tomato basil soup to start.  What I liked about this tomato basil is that it wasn't overly acidic, nor was it overly creamy.  A bit on the mellow side, I could definitely taste all of the ingredients, and it was freshly made, too.  As for my Greek salad, it was delicious.  My only wish was that they would have given 1 or 2 more lamb sausage \"patties,\" so I wouldn't have had to work hard to making it last (I kind of have issues with lettuce to protein ratios.... I like there to be enough to go around).  While there was plenty of fresh spinach leaves, there was not enough lamb.......but don't get me wrong.  There were a decent amount of kalamata olives, onion, cucumber and tomatoes interspersed throughout.  Plus, my husband tossed me his avocado (fool that he is for not eating it).... so I was a very happy girl.  Even their red wine vinaigrette was mild, yet flavorful.......not too much in the vinegar.  It really was a delicious salad.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their meals, as well, but I didn't taste either of theirs to know.\n\nThe desserts looked great, but we were all pretty full when done, and truth be told, my husband and I have been watching our calories, sooooooooo, we took a pass...... but they looked great.  \n\nI would definitely come back to this restaurant, but there are so many to try in this wonderful coastal town, I'm not sure when.","2740":"Wonderful food! So-so service. We had reservations for four. The table was very small, on the order of 36\" by 36\", which was very tight, at best. We asked our waitress what the specials were and she told us they were on the menu card on the table. Ordered four filet mignons which were tasty and cooked to order, but slightly underseasoned. The oyster mushrooms in the sauce were tough, evidently not fresh but reconstituted freeze dried. The zucchini and scalloped potatoes were well seasoned and prepared well. Had to ask our waitress twice for a soda which took ten minutes to deliver. She was there to take orders from us, not make suggestions or make our meal memorable for our daughter celebrating her 21st birthday and college graduation. For what seems like an upscale American bistro, it didn't come close to wow-ing us for the $160+ tab.  Won't return.","2741":"We ate here after we were married at the Santa Barbara courthouse. We easily found on street parking and were seated right away as it was only the lunch hour. I wasn't blown away by any of the dishes that my party had but I loved the ambiance of the place. Wooden family style tables adorned with fresh flower bouquets. The biggest reason Jane gets 3 stars was the lackluster service. Considering that the restaurant was not full, our drinks, food and desserts came out very slowly! The food selection just didn't excite me. My food was well prepared and tasty but it didn't have that wow factor.","2742":"Happy to have a  restaurant open late on a Monday. Our wedding Anniversary celebration ended at a wonderful destination. We got a great table by the windows and like that, the place was packed. A common reaction when I go places. Service was slow but the food is so worth the wait that didn't matter.    Felt like a real local place and if we lived in town we would be back.  No discount if your name is Janie.  No room for dessert I Took a slice of  coconut cake home.","2743":"This place was AMAZING! My family went to celebrate after I graduated and it was the perfect place! The wine list was a little pricey for okay choices, but the food was fantastic. \n\nI would avoid the apple\/goat cheese fritters - they're literally just hunks of apple and goat cheese fried - but the steak was fantastic, AND they had great options for my vegetarian brother :-)","2744":"I had a hard time rating Jane.  I feel like 3 stars is too low and 4 is too high.  Some things are great and others just OK.  If you decide to come, you will probably enjoy yourself, but you'll forget what you ordered by the time you get back home.  \n\nFood is solid...never had something \"bad\".  BUT, there is nothing terrific, tantalizing, or awe inspiring about anything on the menu.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is probably why people come.  Love the name and the ambiance is great.  Upstairs on the balcony is great.  It feels great sitting in the restaurant with a nice glass of wine.  \n\nRestaurant is beautiful. Service is good.  Food is good...And, uh, butter is higher quality than average?  Not much else to say.   I'll probably be back, but not that often.","2745":"Jane left me beyond satisfied and content. Service was good. I had the seafood penne pasta and there flavoring in the sauce was absolutely amazing. Seafood was fresh, and penne was cooked to the perfect texture. Secondly, of course I couldn't resist to leave without trying their famous coconut cake with a nice cappuccino on the side. The coconut cake is a MUST get. The cake itself was very light and had indescribable flavoring. It's an experience you must try on your own.","2746":"Love this restaurant. Had a very romantic dinner while sitting at the small bar with my hubby last night. Service was great. Food was wonderful. I went all out with two glasses of ros\u00e9, appetizer (goat cheese\/smoked salmon pancakes), main course and dessert. What a nice evening! I love their burgers, too. Small, lovely location with understated elegant interior. The lighting was relaxed and dim and soft. Overall, very relaxed. Not cheap, but well worth it.","2747":"Excellent restaurant for food quality food quantity taste wine select and open but intimate ambience.  Plus the compost their food scraps and donate to local charities.  All 3 of us myself, sister and mom enjoyed everything we ate shrimp and ahi salad, burger, and the lamb sausage salad and their potato pancakes with salmon yum yum.. the only sad thing is we do not live in the area... Oh and the prices are not extreme and the food quantities are filling! thanks Jane","2748":"The service was great, the food excellent. Make sure you try the coconut cake.  The best.","2749":"My girlfriends took me out to Jane for my Bachelorette dinner and we all had a lovely time! Stephanie, our server, was so nice and patient dealing with a crowd of seven women. She answered all our questions about the wine menu and waited patiently while we all figured out the bill.\nThe food was great and portion was generous.\nThey also placed us in a private-ish nook and added little personal touches, like a \"bachelorette\" sign and complimentary ice cream with a candle, which we all shared.\nAll and all, we had a wonderful experience at Jane! Thank you!","2750":"Five stars just for the coconut cake.  So rich and fluffy light at the same time.  My wife and I had a big seafood lunch down by the beach so we wanted a light dinner.  We  decided to share an appetizer and entree salad for dinner.  Both were good, but we definitely saved room for dessert.  Service was great and the place was very cute.  I would love to come back for a complete dinner next time we are in SB.","2751":"Michelle was an amazing server! Very attentive. The food was incredible. I recommend the seafood pasta, onion rings appetizer, chicken piccata and the coconut cake! They were to die for!","2752":"The mussels were excellent. Definitely try the coconut cake. Best I've ever had! I don't even love coconut.","2753":"Delicious and fancy place to be at. My partner always wanted to eat here because it looks so pretty and romantic on the outside. We ate here on our 3 year anniversary and loved it. Sweet ambiance inside and friendly hosts. Chicken Piccata with fetuccini alfredo was spectacularly tasty. I love this local SB spot with a beautiful family history.","2754":"We had a we wedding dinner here last night.   We had a group of 24 family celebrating the wedding of our oldest daughter.  Our server was amazing!!  Very attentive, quick and always\nright there to make our dinner amazing.\n  Everyone was raving about their dinners, from the petite to the salmon everything was perfect.  Because of our large group additional staff came in to help when it was needed.  Everyone at this amazing restaurant was so helpful and nice\n\nThank you Jane for helping us to celebrate this wonderful event.  I am sure our family will be\nreturning for more events in the future.","2755":"Outstanding experience.  Seated upstairs near window.\nAppetizer was seared scallops with avocado, asparagus and tomato.  Delcicious.\nBoth the Wild Mexican Seabass and the yellowtail main entr\u00e9e were cooked perfectly with great flavors.  Service attentive.  Prices are very good considering the area.  There are places that would charge more for the same type of food.  I can see why the place was packed on a Thursday night.\nI'm not in Santa Barbara often, but will definitely be back and would definitely recommend.","2756":"I would give this 5 stars but for the fact I come so rarely. To me 5 stars either means it changed your life in one fell swoop or you go regularly. It did neither, yet it is undeniably one of the best restaurants in SB. \n\nThe menu has changed a bit since my last lunch here (probably 2.5 yrs ago). The starters are different and tempting--every single one. \n\nI almost went with the goat cheese pancakes with salmon, cream cheese and caviar (a tiny bit for garnish, I imagine, as it's only 10), but chose the mussels in a light Pernod cream. I love mussels and they were on the small side but there must be two dozen and the sauce as good as any accompaniment to mussels I've ever had. \n\nIt's not a beurre blanc sauce (as at Relais de Paris and many other French restaurants, including La Mangoire on 53rd and 2nd in Manhattan). It's certainly not a low-fat sauce, but it's not overly heavy and has quite a kick. I can't wait to have it again. \n\nMy friend's lamb chops (three) were excellent though not Oilo e Limone quality. That may be the best dish on the menu (Julia Child's balsamic reduction atop the New Zealand lamb chops). These are also fattier than the lamp chops at Olio. But the gratin (almost a dauphinois) was excellent, as were the vegetables. \n\nThe simple but excellent chicken and fettuccine is still on the menu and I'm sure it's as good as it used to be. \n\nThe menu's innovation lies in the \"salad bowls\" and had I not been pressed for time, I might have had either the scallop or papaya salad. \n\nOur server was wonderful (and extremely attractive even by my stringent standards as a child raised around Hollywood). We chatted about classical music and her grandfather I think would get on well with my father (the idea of leaving after the Beethoven on the theory that nothing modern can possibly measure up seemed one that he would approve). \n\nI plan to go to the Granada a great deal in the coming year (UCSB Arts and Lectures 2014-15 season) and will definitely put Jane on the pre-show stable of restaurants. \n\nNote on price: after tip it was 100 for two. That was for one large entree (enough to share), an appetizer (mussels were 13), four glasses of wine. More than fair.\n\nP.S. The bread is underwhelming but perfect for dipping in the sauce with the mussels. Also they give you ONE spoonful of butter for every four pieces of bread. Too funny. I pointed this out and the server said it must have been a mistake. The food runner then proceeded to bring a second butter dish also 90% empty. I guess Jane wants to limit butter consumption pre-meal.","2757":"I took my kids to dinner here and it was remarkable. The service was excellent, and the food is awesome. I had the salmon and my son had the rabbit. Some of the best food I've tasted. Definitely would recommend.","2758":"The service was awful: took about 7 minutes before we got waters, 10 min before we even ordered drinks and when we said we were ready to order food also they said \"after we bring you your drinks\". We literally got our drinks (a bottle of wine and 2 glasses) 10 min later then finally were able to order food. \n\nThe calamari was over cooked and rubbery.\n\nChicken piccata was ok. Sauce could be more flavorful it was really just meh. \n\nMy friend liked her mussels, my other friend got the \"chops and fries\" and she said the best part was the salad that came on the side. \n\nThe hostess was really nice and other items in the menu look promising. I will not be back to the downtown location,\nBut will give the Goleta location a shot once it opens for lunch.","2759":"My husband and I went last night. It's a small place and they try to cram so many people in at once which I don't like. The food was OK but not worth the price. I'm sure there are plenty of other places you can spend that kind of money on and get better food. I just don't feel like it was anything special.","2760":"loved this place. me and my family went to Santa Barbara for wine tasting and a had a wonderful time. I found this place on yelp. We ordered lunch and had cocktails. Everyone was nice and helpful and if you are ever in the area and want some good food please try this place out.","2761":"I've only been here for lunch so I can't speak to the dinner meals. But they have a lot of lunch specials and quite a few salads, which all looked really good. If you want a nice spot for a sandwich or salad during lunch, this is a good one. It seems quite popular though, so you might want to make reservations.","2762":"OK.  Sea Bass overcooked.  A little overpriced.  Do not GO.","2763":"I get a little impatient with reviews based on specific experiences: My bread was cold. The service was slow. My chicken piccata was fabulous! \n\nI'm more interested in the total experience of a restaurant, over time. What's its original intent? How is its POV different? How well does it execute on its intent? Is it consistent?\n\nTo really judge a joint, it takes more than one meal. I like to go back a few times before I make up my mind, and I like to bring other people with me. I've been to Jane three times with friends, so now I feel I can make a provisional judgment. \n\nHere it is: Jane is the real thing. This is very good food, served by a serious wait staff, in authentically unfussy surroundings. It's not about phony elegance, a catchy concept, or a regional theme.  It's about food. \n\nThe dishes are flavorful, surprising, satisfying. They're not amped up, over-designed, or trendy. They borrow from the usual food cultures---France, Italy, California, U.S. heartland---without making a big deal out of any one. They're plain Jane, using \"plain\" in its most positive Shaker-like sense.\n\nYou'll probably meet Jane in the flesh. She told us she's not actually a chef, but the daughter of a couple of chefs who run another restaurant, the Montecito Cafe. Her parents should be proud. I can tell you that Jane and her eponymous restaurant are quickly moving up my list of favorites.","2764":"Came here for dessert with my wife awhile ago based on reviews on Yelp. My wife ordered the coconut cake which was melt-in-you-mouth good (and I don't even like coconut!).  I ordered the chocolate marquise with creme anglais, which was rich but not too sweet.\n\nDid not eat dinner here but the food from tables around us smelled and looked great. \n\nService was excellent even though it was graduation weekend for UCSB and it was late at night.","2765":"This place is great.  First off, the restaurant is a family owned place, which I love.  I got to meet the grand daughter of who the place was named after, who by chance is also named Jane.  \n\nThe restaurant has a great vibe.  The ambiance [5 of 5 stars] is casual but quaint. there are two levels in the place and a tiny balcony which looked really cool... the only thing was that on the day of our visit the heaters were not working, which was a bummer.  The restaurant can accommodate for small or large groups, but I would DEFINITELY recommend getting reservations.  We were super lucky in getting a seat even though we didn't have one.\n\nNow to the food.  \nI got the Lamb with potato and string greens [4 of 5 stars].  It had some oranges in it, which I felt were way to strong to pair well with the lamb, which is a more delicate taste.  Other than the oranges though, the meal was good.    The lamb was well cooked while being soft and flavorful.  The sides paired well with the food in that they weren't overpowering the taste of the meat (with exception to the oranges of course).  \n\nMy date got the season fillet [5 of 5 stars]. (I honestly forgot what it came with, sorry).  It was really good!  The filet was cooked great (even though it was a medium and I prefer a medium rare).  The meat was super tender and melted in my mouth.  The mushroom sauce was a great pair, and the like the above, the sides paired well with it.  \n\nfor dessert, we got the Chocolate Chiffon [5 of 5 stars].  This was really soft and really decadent.  If you like that kind of stuff, you will definitely like this.  The server recommended that we get some raspberry sauce on the side, which definitely added to it. It also comes with a cream on the side which tastes a bit like vanilla bean ice cream.     \n\nOverall, this is certainly a recommended place to go if you are in town and if you can get a seat.","2766":"We have been traveling in CA for 3 weeks and this has probably been the best meal so far! The space is great although a bit loud. Loved the upper loft seating layout. All our food was fresh and creative but not over the top. We loved the chicken piccata and filet mignonette. Save room for dessert, crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e is perfect and traditional (no enhancements, just rich and creamy).","2767":"Yummy food, cool, hip atmosphere, excellent service, diverse menu.  It really is hard to beat this place.  Romantic evening for sure.  Very reasonable wine list; not too flooofy, they don't put on airs. Very California. Delicious. I am still dreaming about my seafood stew.","2768":"Jane is a great place for a celebration with friends and family or a quick meal for one before Thomas Friedman at the Arlington. Great service, good, and location!","2769":"So delicious and such a  unique and beautiful little place. Get the rack of Lamb, is teh best lamb I have ever had!!!","2770":"Yummy! And, great service too. We'll definitely be back... A bit loud, but could still hear the conversation around the table.","2771":"Apple and brie fritter salad was very good.  The batter on the apples and brie was perfect, and the salad had the perfect dressing to compliment the fritters. \n\nThe red onion rings were amazing. Perfect batter, perfectly cooked, and the balsamic reduction drizzle was genius. I recommend asking for extra balsamic and skipping the dipping sauce. \n\nThe gorgonzola salad was very good. Excellent mixture of ingredients and dressing. \n\nWe were also very pleased to see Pranqster and Brother Thelonius beers on the menu. Two of our favorites.","2772":"Delicious food! Had the seafood pasta and enjoyed it. Would definitely dine at again.","2773":"I love Jane!  In one word I'd describe it as \"charming.\"  This is the place I like to bring my family when they come into town to visit.  Staff is friendly are prices are decent.\n\nI really like the chicken picatta which has great flavor and the coconut cake which is surprisingly moist and delicious.","2774":"Service was exceptional as well - nicely done! Didn't have any prior conception of this spot but, I'll tell you what, the filet mignon won me over. Overall good.","2775":"The food was good, but the service was only so-so.\n\nI took my parents and my sister out to dinner to Jane on a Monday evening. Even though we showed up at 6:00pm, the place was packed. Our server had a larger party up stairs and our table downstairs which probably made him less attentive to us. \n\nMy parents and I had the filet mignon with the scalloped potatoes, which were awesome. My sister had the chicken and Brie sandwich, but she wasn't impressed. \n\nI will give Jane another shot in the future to see if the service improves.","2776":"I really enjoy Jane. The staff is always friendly, the place always bright and beautiful.  I've only ever been for lunch which was ok. A bit overpriced for lunch and the lack of flavors. But the thing that brings me back is always that coconut cake. It's amaaaaazing.  It's multi-tier, has the coconut chunks on the sides and you get to swirl it into a milky anglaise and its just divine. I've actually made trips from my hotel on the beach up to Jane just to have this cake.\n\nI've never tried the dinner dishes to they might be great. Regardless, get the cake. Even if your food is meh, you'll leave happy as a camper :)","2777":"I visited Jane last night with my friend Debby for dinner. \n\nWe tried the Coconut Shrimp, yum and the Cheese Stuffed Poblano, which was a nice idea but wasnt cooked thru. I wasnt wowed by Seared Ahi Tuna and Shrimp Salad but the nightly special, Broiled Halibut with Tomato Cream Sauce was to die for. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce, a savory symphony in my mouth. \n\nDebby drinks white wine and I prefer red so we were relegated to the wines by the glass list. I was a little disappointed Demetria Pinot Noir was only one of two Pinots by the glass. This is Santa Barbara wine country after all.","2778":"As time passes, the number of stars goes down.  That  trajectory is a direct factor of how, though as charming the restaurant atmosphere and setting is, it is not enough to carry a meal. Away from that lovely place, the food memory is = meh.  Ordered all the specialities = meh. Service was given by a kind person but sloooowww and not particularly attentive.  Waited at the door for ten minutes unacknowledged.  We headed into the restaurant with too high of expectations, so a readjustment will have to occur before returning.","2779":"Amazing food. Deserves Michelin star rating. Perfect ambiance. And excellent service! One of our top favorite restaurants!","2780":"Jane on State St. is the quintessential Santa Barbara restaurant. From the friendly staff, to the inviting, cozy size, and beautiful d\u00e9cor it is a picturesc, local spot to enjoy an evening. The food is fresh and delicious. \n\nAt the end of April we hosted our families (14 people) on their inside mezzanine for our wedding dinner. It could not have been a more perfect final event for our day. The table was nicely decorated with table settings, small flowers, and a printed menu when we arrived. We chose a 3 course, $55\/person set menu and pre-selected wine for the table. The options offered were perfect for our group and everyone raved about the food. Jane's went above and beyond to accommodate our groups requests and make our evening amazing. \n\nWe highly recommend.","2781":"How to summarize Jane? 5 star food at 3 or 4 star prices! The entrees are in the $20-$30 dollar range but seem like they should cost significantly more. We enjoyed the mixed berry salad, chops & fries, penne pasta, and goat cheese pancakes. Everyone at the table was marveling at the quality, taste and freshness of the food.","2782":"Great ambiance and very friendly staff.. chicken piccata was very flavorful and the fettuccini was cooked perfectly and had very creamy sauce.  Spaghetti Bolognese was just ok.. we tried the cheesecake and thought it tasted very sour creamish.. great for a date not recommended for children","2783":"I have enjoyed eating at Jane every time I have been there.  This is a fun place for a group, as well as just dinner with a friend or two.  Some of the food is just okay, some of the food, like the grilled yellowtail I had last time, is AMAZING.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The coconut cake is also worth trying.","2784":"I can only speak to the chicken piccata, because I can't bring myself to try anything else.  It's that good.  Have had for lunch and dinner. Lunch portion comes with smaller sides, and potatoes vs pasta. Staff is always gracious. Also a lovely pre - theater meal.  Really, you must try it!","2785":"Excellent food. Friendly staff. I had the Mahi with sauteed swiss chard - it was scrumptious! If you are in SB go to Jane!","2786":"Nice place, mediocre food, relatively pricy.\n\nChicken fettucine pasta we ordered was like an Olive Garden plate, nothing special or great. I'd honestly rather go to Cheesecake factory (same pricing, better food). \n\nAnother person in my table complained about the steak sandwich he had and the manager (some lady in her 20s or 30s) was basically telling him off claiming that he was wrong and that he should know better since he ate most of it. The thing is that half the sub was fine, and the other half was terrible which is why he consumed most of it. Incredibly rude, especially when the birthday girl had to see that. The server was sweet (he had a sleeve and a nose ring), we felt so bad because we had to split our check in a really difficult way. \n\nI am not from the area, but if I ever am I will never come again. The food isn't that great and the manager really ruined it for us. Here's a tip for you: think about what you say before it could ruin the business.","2787":"I have been to Jane twice and so far its been great.\n\nThe atmosphere is great homey and charming, and you can get a table easily during the week for lunch.\n\nYummy and very creative salads such a nice change from the average chicken caesar and cobb options.\n\nFriendly staff, just attentive enough without being intrusive or hovering.\n\nHaven't been for dinner yet but will soon.","2788":"An easy 5 stars. \n\nAtmosphere is calm, spacious -- you can enjoy a meal with your friends without shouting at them or being elbowed by nearby diners.  Waitstaff is polite, friendly, mindful of timing and dining pace. \n\nAnd. the. food. Don't get me started. Everything was exactly right. Salmon on a cedar plank.  Potatoes. Steamed veggies. The wine. The caprese salad. The coconut cake.  There just aren't words to do the meal justice. \n\nThis might be the best meal I've had in Santa Barbara, after living here for TEN YEARS. How have I not been here before? Your guess is as good as mine -- but at least we've set the record straight.","2789":"YUM YUM YUM.  I never give 5 stars, but Jane doesn't deserve anything less.\n\nI made reservations for a group of 6 girls for my sister's Bachelorette Party.  When we arrived on Friday, 8\/2, we were greeted with warmth and felt very welcome.  \n\nThey had a beautiful kings table set up for us, with gorgeous sunflowers and candles.  The ambiance in the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.\n\nOur waitress was phenomenal.  Just attentive enough and made some wonderful suggestions.  I don't remember her name, but we were told she was fairly new.  She was very knowledgeable and made the evening great!\n\nStarted with the Onion Rings, OMG these were delicious.\nEveryone got something different and we all picked at each others plates.  The salads were delish, Chicken Pasta had a wonderful sauce, and the Chicken and Brie Sandwich was amazing.  Every bite was delicious!  We finished our meal with the lightest, most delicious Coconut Cake.  It was divine!\n\nI will definitely be going back to Jane the next time I am in SB!","2790":"Came here on a whim for a family dinner during a stay in santa Barbara. Amazing food, cozy atmosphere, great service. Wonderful experience all around !","2791":"Dungeness Crab Papaya Salad! so.good. I never would have thought of this combination but sitting on the upstairs patio on a beautiful afternoon devouring this was the perfect wind down to my weekend getaway to Santa Barbara. The upstairs patio area is a tiny, itty bitty thing that fits only two couples but its romantic and sweet.","2792":"thank you jane for always: \n\n- welcoming us like we're your old friend\n- offering a fresh and creative menu\n- serving a list of great wine choices\n- tempting us with super dessert options..... [admittedly, we go there] :)\n\nmeals here are super consistent, delectable and reliable.   we've just learned the hostess name and must offer that linnea is a great addition to the restaurant.  wait staff is super helpful and informative and willing to go the extra step to make the experience and meal a delight.\n\nwe're happy you're here in SB, jane.  \nkeep up your amazing-ness - we'll be back again and again!","2793":"Half of the experience at Jane makes you feel at home, and the other half is fine dining in a fancy restaurant.  Throw in great food and you've got a winning combination that should appeal to a large variety of diners.  The staff is friendly and helpful; the restaurant has a great ambiance, and the food is very good.  Make sure to save room for dessert; I got into a big argument over whether the coconut cake was more insanely delicious or less insanely delicious than whatever pecan thing my opponent ordered.","2794":"Oh no!  I hate it when I feel obliged to  update a review from 5 stars to 2. Loved the first time we ate there.  This time- just okay. Server- nice guy.  Had a 6:30 reservation (thinking early would get us on our way as we wanted to make it an early evening).  Server, Ben, came right up. Gave us some recommendations. Orderd a salad starter, two entrees, 1 glass of wine.  20 (!!!)  minutes later, Caesar Salad (very mediocre and nothing Caesary about it- tasted like a creamy dressing w\/o much flavor). ONE HOUR from ordering the entrees arrived.  Server did come about 10-15 mins before the food arrived and apologized for the delay- apparently a large party upstairs got their orders in first and ours was way slow.  Had the lamb chop special ($27 too high for what it was- scalloped potatoes on plate needed salt)- it was pretty good but frankly, I was so hungry by then, that anything would have been fine.    It would have gone a long way if he'd comped us a starter or a glass of wine- something.  Will try other places in Santa Barbara before going back.","2795":"I've walked and drove by this little spot a million times, never gave it much of a glance, so glad we tried it for early mother's day!  I made a reservation a week early, not sure how fast they book up? I have to think pretty quickly, we got a little table, not my favorite, but, it worked out fine, apparently you have to specially ask for the terrace or whatever, NEXT time!! and there will be a NEXT time, our waitress was Emma, she's absolutely awesome! honest, quick, ya know, what you'd expect from a 4 1\/2 star yelp restaurant.  Food was off the hook! well, I did have the fish and chips, substituted the onion rings for fries, they were really really good!  Fish was very light, as was the batter.  Best mom\/Wife in the world had greek salad, she said it was awesome too!  Looked good! I was eye balling other dishes around us, everything looked great!  We're very happy we found this oasis!  Can't wait to try other items on the menu, prices were not out of this world either!  Good Luck!  I took pictures of my food, saw there were already a million or so here, didn't use any then. \n\nthey don't open till 5:30 I think they're open for lunch from 11 to 2:30, closed sunday! even mothers day.  Nice to see a place that isn't so greedy!","2796":"$8 for a Caesar Salad that was extremely small, I really should've sent it back. Such a stingy amount, how stingy? Let's just say it should've cost $5 for the amount I got, when the plate came out I had to ask myself did they spill some of it or did the server eat part of it, the plate looked so big and sad with all five ice burg leaves and splash of salad dressing, was gone in 5 bites. The saddest part is I was actually looking forward to dining at Jane, I insisted on going here. Of all the other restaurants we could have gone to I chose Jane and even called ahead and made a reservation. \n\nMoving on: our main course was pleasing taste wise but again SUPER SHAMELESS you'd have to be incredibly delusional to think this was fair Stingy amount. Let's just say regardless of how tasty it was, I walked out starving even though I ate a starter and and entree. How much did it cost? About $80 for two without drinks or dessert before tax. Did we get ripped off? Yes! Was I infuriated? Yes! Knowing that I could've gone to Chipotle and had a $10 buritto and been happily nourished without spending $40 (before tip)...  \n\nDon't get me started on the wine list... I won't name the bottles, but let's just say you really shouldn't mark up a $7 bottle to $42... that's just wrong who do you think we are, idiots? I've been around the block and if that bottle was marked up morally and ethically to $26, then you might actually be selling bottles.  \n\nUnacceptable coming from a casual restaurant. To top it all off the host was wearing Vans, I LOVE VANS, am not knocking Vans I own 4 pairs myself they're great for running errands on your days off, but it kind of doesn't go with the whole we're trying to be an upscale restaurant that charges a lot for nothing vibe.","2797":"We went to Jane for the first time based on all the great reviews however our experience was disappointing. Our waiter was friendly but had too many tables so service was slow. Our appetizer and dinners were average at best. To top it off, our bill came with an error on it. We are locals and won't be returning as there are much better dining options nearby.","2798":"You can't do any better than Jane! It's wonderful!! Having Salmon tonight. So, so good!","2799":"My boyfriend and I love this place! It's delicious, well priced and has unique and delicious food. \n\nTonight, we were waited on by Jennifer. She was great, consistently filling our water and checking on us without being in our face. Best waitress we've had here. \n\nWe'll definitely be back!","2800":"YUM!! I do not say this lightly, this might have been the best salmon I've ever tasted. No disrespect to my mother in law who is a fabulous cook and was sitting right next to me, but she agreed it was incredible. I don't remember the full name of the fish but it was amazing. \n\nI LOVE the ambiance of this place. It's cozy, intimate, and well decorated. There's a fireplace and 2 upstairs lofted seating areas. Wonderful for a romantic dinner or fancy group occasion. Service was excellent.","2801":"This was our fave restaurant in visiting SB. Relatively high up on State, and a bit separated from the hustle of lower state. Everything feels very homey here, from the ambiance to the food. The staff is incredibly nice, and everything on the menu is fresh and organic. Just a great place for wine and a good dinner, not overly priced for SB.","2802":"The Chicken Piccatta - literally the best meal that I've had in weeks! The chicken was so incredibly flavorful and it was balanced with a buttery fettuccine. Even the vegetables on the side tasted amazing! \n\nI was pretty full by the time I finished my meal (I had wiped my plate clean), but I decided I had room for dessert. I ordered the Coconut Cake since it was so highly reviewed and I didn't regret doing so at all. \n\nJane is definitely a place I'll be making sure I come back to every time I visit Santa Barbara. It may be a bit on the pricey side, and you may have to make reservations a week ahead of time, but it is all definitely worth it!","2803":"We've been here many times. Food is good for SB but nothing special. However our 8 year old likes the kids pasta that comes with a soft cone ice cream. When it came to dessert, I asked for an adult cone and a kids cone. We were told to wait 10 mn for the machine to freeze ice cream. We waited. Another 10 mn later, the young manager said it would take another 10 mn. So we waited. Finally we said we can't wait anymore as my husband had to go to work. They offered my kid a piece of toffee to compensate. The hostess at the desk apologized and offered to bring the dessert menu to \"buy\" dessert! So we complained that we've been waiting 20-30 mn for the stupid soft cones and asked to see the manager. she said she was the manager!! The least they could have done is to comp us for a dessert, having waited so long. And we told her so. But The manager was less helpful than the male server who hardly showed up. Meanwhile the place was packed. obviously they are taking their loyal clientele for granted. Sorry Jane, you lost us as customers. You should train your managers to try to remedy problems not accentuate them. The manager said the ice cream machine rarely didn't work. I pointed this out that another time we came in and the same happened. Maybe time to have a plan B for the when the machine doesn't work? Toffee won't cut it in any kid's book. Very disappointing how things were handled by a young, seemingly inexperienced manager. And since when is the hostess the same as a manager. Cutting corners in staffing definitely shows. Be forewarned.","2804":"we come from San Francisco, and have found Jane to be our first stop to dine in while we are here.  We have been to many restos in this hot spot for foodies, and Jane is definitely a place to stop into for some goooooooood foood. We had the chicken piccatta, and the baked brie and apple salad, nom nom nom.  We will be going back again tonight, since we just got in. Oh yeah, I guess vegetarians....do not come here, they dont cater to you, but they have a very generic vegetarian dish.  JANE!","2805":"Very cute restaurant, excellent attentive service, linguine with clams excellent, coconut cake yummy","2806":"What a hidden gem this place was. I was visiting Santa Barbara from LA on a whim for a friend's birthday and thank god yelp led us here.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is charming and warm, with string lights and wooden decor.  At the same time, the place is hip as well as romantic. You could as easily go here with family as you could on a date.\n\nWe started with the caesar salad and onion rings. The caesar was good, but the onion rings, delicious. Seriously, get these onion rings. You have to. \n\nAfter our first course (we're fat asses), I got the linguine with clams which was holy-shit-i-want-to-eat-this-forever- good. The clams were perfect and they were doused in a garlic butter wine sauce.. My friend ordered the bolognese (delicious) and my mom, the flank steak with madeira sauce (seriously, so delightful).  Even though we were so damn full, we had to order the coconut cake, and it was the best decision we've ever made. This cake is so good that if you like coconut you absolutely must get it no matter how full you are. It was light and fluffy, but with flavors that exploded in your mouth. It also was paired with a vanilla-cream sauce. It was the best cake I've ever had. I swear I would stop at this place to eat this cake again on the way to San Francisco. The guy sitting behind us heard us raving and said he'd fly from Kansas to eat this cake. We got ANOTHER piece of cake to go. Literally, order this cake.\n\nOur waiter was also a dream. He was so nice and an impeccable, friendly, awesome server. \n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone. We loved it so much.","2807":"The BEST burger I've had in forever!  Perfectly cooked, fresh egg roll\/bun, delicious fries.  Went with a group of 6 girlfriends and ALL of us were totally pleased with the food.  Portions, quality, and price were excellent.  Very efficient waitress, terrific service, pleasant atmosphere.  What a wonderful experience!  I will definitely return and recommend JANE to friends!","2808":"We LOVE this restaurant.  Always great food and good service.  I am especially partial to the Greek salad and any of their fish entrees.  Don't leave the restaurant without a piece of coconut cake.\n\nThe restaurant is very child friendly and the kid's meal is fabulous!","2809":"Dined here last night. Seared scallops for appetizer were ok. Not bad just not memorable. But the seared ahi and broiled prawns salad bowl was definitely memorable - fantastic! I modified the fettucini w\/lamb sausage pasta and had it without the lamb sausage and it was a nice hearty bowl. I was craving upscale comfort food and this dish delivered. Just the right amount of garlic. Husband had the filet mignon and he loved it. Wished we had room for dessert but didn't - the coconut cake looked delicious.","2810":"I have to preface this with stating I'm a simple person and love great food. I'm no expert but I know fine dining and have had the privilege to dine at many esteemed establishments. And prior to Valentine's day I believed Jane to be one of them.\n\nBoth my girlfriend and I went for a nice Valentine's day dinner which offered a set menu priced at $65 per person. It offered interesting and exciting choices, however most dishes were a disappointment. The service was great and the waitress was very nice. The decor was very nice, quaint with romanticly dim lighting. The tables were a little too close but it wasn't a big problem.\n\nOn to the food, I ordered the lobster bisque appetizer which was nothing more than flavorless cream and food coloring. We also got the steamed muscles with parmesan and spinach which was flavorful and good. For our entr\u00e9e we ordered the duck breast with a blackberry reduction and the filet mignon, both came with steamed vegetables and scalloped potatoes. The sides were part of the set menu, no other options available. Both dishes were ok, definitely not great. The only redeeming quality of the dinner was the coconut chiffon cake, it was amazing, light and airy and left me wanting more.\n\nAlong with dinner we had 2 glasses of house champagne that came with the set menu. There was no substitute for the champagne which I found odd being in an area that offers so many great wines.\n\nIn conclusion, I would probably visit this place again but never on a night with a set menu. The other options on the regular menu seemed so much more appetizing and reasonably priced. I could have more easily forgiven the bland food, had the price not been so steep. I expected to be wowed but walked out disappointed.","2811":"Great meal here on New Year's Weekend. Boyfriend had the fettuccine and chicken pasta that was delicious. I had the Jane burger. It was good but could have used a little less of the onions, there was a mound of them and I think that's what made my hamburger bun all soggy (was already like that when it was served). Very cute interior and decor, good for romantic dates!","2812":"Friendly service! Make sure you call ahead though, to be on the safe side!","2813":"The service was great and everyone was so nice. The food was okay! The first dish I didn't like and they were kind enough to offer me something. I ended up with the Jane Burger which was decent. I'm definitely up for giving this place another try.","2814":"One of the BEST places I have dined at in Saint Babs! Wait staff was Excellent!!! We started with an appetizer--\"Red Rings\" (I believe they were called) was very tasty. My mother and I had the Veal Marsala which was absolutely delicious!!! Each bite was sheer bliss and served with yellow beets (which I imagine can change given what is selected for the menu that evening), and a fettuccine with Parmesan. My other two guests got the chicken piccata and the NY peppercorn steak. They raved about their entr\u00e9es and you could tell they too savored each bite. This could be a five star restaurant if the bread basket was served warm. My recommendation would be to either change the selection of the bread (which maybe they do) and\/or serve it toasty warm. Not really a big issue and should not hinder anyone from going to a true \"Santa Barbara Treasure!\" When making reservations, the woman I talked with was a bit snarky for no reason but in all fairness, maybe she was just having a bad day. There was a crowd which kept the door open as they lined up out the door. We sat towards the front of the restaurant and some of my guests did get chilled, but it is rare SB is cold--again not a big deal. I look forward in returning (day dreaming as I type this review:) to Jane and am proud that Santa Barbara has a restaurant of this caliber!","2815":"Loved this place.  Very nicely designed and furnished.  Friendly, professional service. Thoughtful menu.  For Starters we shared the coconut prawns w\/ mango,arugula salad & curry mayo and the Broiled oysters w\/ spinach, bacon pieces and spectacular sauce on top. For entrees we had the lamb rack special w\/ sundried (i think) tomato\/port sauce, broccolini, scalloped potatoes and the Greek full-meal salad. I had the recommended pinot with my dinner. Service by Lauren was just right- attentive, not hovering, great recommendations. Food was plated nicely, right temp, perfect portions.  Prices were very reasonable- 2 starters, 2 dinners, 1 glass wine- about $70.   I will DEFINITELY go back next time in Santa Barbara next month.","2816":"Five star all the way. The environment is wonderful-wine bottles line the wall. You feel like you are in wine country. The staff is very accommodating and the food, oh the food is DELICIOUS! I had the chicken piccata and my fianc\u00e9 had the filet mignon. I would highly recommend both. For dessert we had the cheesecake. It was wonderful. I would highly recommend visiting this restaurant.","2817":"Great place for dinner , walk in and sit at the bar or make a reservation for a table \n\nVery friendly staff and good value \n\nJust ate again and loved it !!!","2818":"Are you a creature of habit? Do you love a dish so much that you have to order it. For me Jane Restaurant in Santa Barbara makes the most spectacular chicken piccata that I am unable to order another dish. They are known for the chicken piccata and it is obvious why. Every time ( and I have had it 4-5 times) it is crispy, tender and just \"melt in your mouth\" delicious. The fettuccine they serve with it is cheesy and perfectly cooked al dente - it's never mushy. Jane Restaurant offers a special meal in a casual neighborhood style - the staff is always smiling and accommodating which makes me want to go back and recommend it to my friends. Hint  - order the chicken piccata","2819":"Food was so-so.   Elements of it were delicious but other parts were lacking.   Service was lovely.   A bit noisy which was a struggle for older members of our group.","2820":"We decided to try Jane after hearing so much about it and we couldn't have been happier! The service was amazing from the moment we walked in the door. The hostess led us to the bar and poured us wine while we waited! We were on a date, and everywhere else we went made us wait forever for a drink.  The appetizer (goat cheese pancakes with smoked salmon) was unreal, and both of us loved our entrees. Can't wait to go back.","2821":"i have tried there chicken piccata twice and both times have been heavenly.","2822":"Well, where do I start. Hostess was prompt and very professional, wait staff were quick and responsive and extremely nice. We ordered a few appetizers, they were great! I recommend the Garlic Shrimp (I think that's the one).\n\nMain meals were delicious too although the highlight of the dinner was by far the Coconut Cake. Un-freakin-believeable! Delicious!","2823":"I've eaten at Jane twice now, and both times were excellent. The servers are friendly and helpful, and the food is excellent! Both times, I've ordered el macho burger, which is delicious, but I've also tried the lamb pasta, the filet, and a beautiful salad. Most importantly, our check with three drinks and tip tonight was $55. There aren't many places in Santa Barbara that are so reasonably priced, and even fewer that are so delicious! This may be our new date place.","2824":"nice place in a nicer part of state street. well appointed.  spot on service with a reservation at 6:15; goat cheese pancakes were a flavor bomb. wine from los olivos; sea bass with tarragon; super greek salad with lamb sausage, split for two. wild caught rockfish sandwich, not breaded or fried, thank you. crem'brulee, split. thanks. perfect date night. ps the arlington is next door, and the central market is around the block. fun!","2825":"The food is ridiculously good! Our server was pregnant, I'm pretty sure.. And she was seriously so patient and kind while I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat. I ended up being an asshole and was picky about certain items in my salad. My salad came out exactly how I wanted it and she wasn't annoyed with me at all. \n\nShe was very very very very very nice!! I wish I lived closer because the food was soooooo good! I love all the different types of salads. The only problem is that I am pretty picky. \n\nThis place rocks!","2826":"Cute restaurant with friendly service and yummy food.  They also have a vegetarian menu if you ask them.\n\nWe sat on the patio upstairs this past summer for a pleasant evening with great service.\n\nSame owners as Montecito cafe, I think?...","2827":"One of my favorite spots in SB. The Chicken Piccata and Salmon are top notch and be sure to finish you meal with the coconut cream cake!","2828":"The service was probably the worst I've experienced in a restaurant in a long time, they started us out by ignoring our request for a window facing table under the pretense it was reserved, the table stood empty for 2 hours until close.\n\nSo instead they sat us next to a 16 person table, next to the busing station, in between the waitress banging my chair with plates and trays and the loud table next to us we couldn't have a conversation.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the staff was condescending, ignored our request numerous times and in general seemed burdened with us.\n\nThe food was mostly awful, the bread was stale and hard, the filet mignon had the consistency of a rubber sole with a big chunky gristle in the center, and an overpowering taste of herbs ( not in a good way), and a BBQ Burger gave indigestion to one of my companions.\n\nAbout the only good thing I can say about the food is that the Chicken Piccata and the Fired Brie and Apple fritters were tasty, so about 2 out 6 things we ate were good, the rest was garbage.\n\nBut the service, what a disaster, the other one of my companions, which happens to own a 5 star Hotel and Restaurant, couldn't help herself and inquired about the table and the level of service, the staff response was unapologetic, we are short on staff, we don't know, it's not our problem, we left before getting our dessert for fear of the staff spitting on it ( yeah that bad), and we left no tip, something we had never ever done in many many years of combined dinning. \n\nWe ended up our night on a high note across the street at Bouchon, where we were treated like kings, and served dessert even though they were about to close.\n\nJane, you were the low point in a 48 hour trip with folks I love and hadn't seen in 2 years. Shame on you.","2829":"Jane is owned by the same family who own the Montecito Bar and the Montecito Cafe.\n\nThey have a lot of great comfort food, desserts, and wines.  I wish they had a bar!  Their ambiance is old-school with lots of wine bottles and cool black-and-white pics on the wall of the woman the restaurant is named for.  \n\nThe macho burger is excellent.  I'm also a fan of the pasta with shellfish and red pepper.  You can't go wrong with dessert, either.  Save room.","2830":"Where do I begin! Jane is one if my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. I am an avid wine drinker, so their great selection makes us a great pair. The food is unparalleled! The beer battered onion rings are beyond words. I love the filet, it's my favorite dinner on the menu, although I am still working through the menu","2831":"The service was friendly and efficient, and the desserts--chocolate marquise and coconut cake--were exceptionally wonderful.  But the appetizer and main course were total disappointments.  The coconut shrimp's coating had no coconut flavor at all and the shrimp itself was raw.  The dipping sauce was horrible.  The duck was tasteless, chewy, with skin that wasn't crispy in the least, just fatty, and the berry sauce was tart with no sweetness to balance it.  I don't expect to return.","2832":"We had a great evening at Jane celebrating our dear friends' wedding reception.  It was nice to have the entire space reserved for our group, and the 2 upstairs areas were a great way to split up the crowd.  There are a few small tables on the upstairs balcony, so I recommend requesting one - definitely the best seats to enjoy the fresh Santa Barbara breeze and State St. people-watching.  Jane's staff was very professional and swift, and their bartender was particularly fun and memorable.  I enjoyed my wedge salad and veal marsala, and my husband enjoyed the seafood penne along with a couple slices of coconut cake!","2833":"One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara by far. Every from the pasta,steak and fish are above anything else you will find on State street.","2834":"My valentines day dinner was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed the preset menu that was made. There was so many great choices that it was hard to pick just one. I ended up getting the fillet mignon and it was  amazing!!!  The service was great, food was awesome and had the best seats in the house!  I'm a raving customer and will be back when I'm in town.","2835":"This place was as close to perfect as a restaurant can be. We were going somewhere else and ended up at Jane. What a stroke of luck!! The food is amazing. I had Jane's famous chicken. Juicy and delicious. And for dessert you have to try the coconut cake. And Jane was there and she was so lovely. This place is warm and wonderful.","2836":"Service is weak. Food is just fine. I don't recommend. So many other great places to eat really good food. Sadly, this is not one of them. I had read good reviews. So, maybe it was a bad night. I'll never go back.","2837":"Had the chicken piccata--it was perfect. Husband had the fish and chips--way delish.\nOverall: I'd recommend this place.","2838":"Very good food and great service. We went last night at 9:50 and they still took us happily and they never said the words \" we will close in 10 minutes \" their grilled artichoke was amazing and the dock plate was great and amazing too.","2839":"Went to Jane for the first a few days ago with my girlfriend. For a Monday night, the place was really packed, and we had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table (there was a huge birthday party and place seemed a little understaffed). \nWe waited at the bar with a glass of wine and beer, and servers we fully friendly, always keeping us updated on table, asking if they could do more for us, etc.\nWhen looking at the menu, there was a large variety and diversity of dinners offered, and I was kind of overwhelmed with what to pick. Everything sounded delicious.\nI decided for the Grilled Chicken & Fried Brie Sandwich, and it was bomb. The sandwich was tasty to the last bite, and the fries were just amazing!\nMy girlfriend went for the fettucini and lamb sausage, and it was even better. Fresh pasta, great lamb sausage, and the whole combination was just perfect.\nDespite the wait, this place deserves ALL 5 stars, as we left happy, full, and already looking forward to the next time at Jane's.","2840":"Went here based on Yelp reviews. The GF and I were heading home after a quick run up to one of our favorite wineries in Paso Robles.  We needed gas so decided to stop in SB. Hunger dictated we eat so Yelp to the rescue. Reviews sounded good but it was a Saturday night at 8 with no reservation. We were seated on the balcony overlooking State Street and were toasty thanks to the heatlamps.  Shared the warm Brie salad and it was delicious,  GF wanted the sea bass but they were out so she opted for the Mahi-Mahi. Again, another winner. The seafood stew was great as well.","2841":"Yum!  Really great service, delicious and well thought out menu, and pretty atmosphere.  Loved the apple fritter, fried Brie salad and the Jane sundae.  Jane came to our table to check on us..nice touch!  You need to go here!","2842":"This restaurant is so cute! We came to SB from LA to get away for a few days, and Jane was only a mile away from where we were staying. I would highly recommend it! Great experience, good wait staff, and very cute environment. P.S. we sat at the upper level outdoor patio.","2843":"Thank Goodness we missed the turn off for Andersons pea soup!!! Driving down 101 we ended up in Santa Barbara, yelp led us to Jane's and it was SUPERB. We did lunch , and it was great, had the lunch swordfish sandwich many husband had the burger, it was really delicious!! Will be back again.","2844":"Over all it was a good experience, but not quite five stars for the price. The ambiance was okay. My husband had VEAL PUTTANESCA, it was good. I had GRILLED INDIANA DUCK BREAST, it was a little rare. Service was average. There are a lot of restaurants in this area, we would try a different one next time when we are in town.","2845":"Wonderful seafood stew!  My daughter loved the pasta as well.   If they would be more kids friendly will be even better!","2846":"My friends and I had a birthday here yesterday and overall it was an enjoyable experience.\nWith the reviews on yelp I ordered the following and here is my review:\n\nChicken Piccata: Its a very smooth and well-cooked texture of chicken and pasta. The sauce it creamy, lots of my friends needed hot sauce to go with it but for me it wasn't enough amount to have in need. I give this 5\/5 stars\n\nCoconut Cake: This was also really good but so expensive. I ended up paying around $20 for just two slices of cake. You can go to any bakery and get a full cake....It was really good and classy but just not worth this much. Because of the price I'd give it 4\/5.\n\nFirestone red Rings: was the best onion rings I've ever had. It's fried in the most perfect balance between crunchness and savory You have to get it even though it's again overpriced in my opinion.\n\nOverall Taste in Food: 5\/5\nOverall worth in price: 3\/5\nOverall experience: 4\/5.","2847":"My SO and I were in Santa Barbara for the weekend, and happened upon Jane while checking out State Street.  The menu looked enticing, but it was 7:00 on a Saturday night -- and no reservation.  We took a chance and were warmly greeted by Jane, who asked if we would like to have a drink at the bar and she would land us a table as soon as possible.  She was very gracious and escorted us to the bar and recommended some daily wine specials.  We enjoyed our wine, and within 15 minutes, a wonderful table on the front balcony opened up!  It was perfect, very charming.  We entered through a set of french doors and were seated in a nice corner table for 2, with a view of State Street and the added bonus of live music from the Mexican eatery across the street (very fun!)\n\nThe food was perfect - I had a wonderful apple fritter and fried brie cheese salad (not low calorie, but a fabulous treat), and a beautiful chicken breast dish that was perfect!\n\nMy SO had a beet and goat cheese salad that was perfect, and the salmon special -- again, perfection.\n\nThe service was perfect -- the right timing and level of attention.\n\nCan't wait to return to this gem!","2848":"So many great things to say about this restaurant.  I'm a local of 38 years, and Jane is a favorite of mine.  Great salads, pizza and entrees and desserts--both lunch and dinner.  Friendly atmosphere and professional waitstaff.  Highly recommended.","2849":"One of my favorite restaurants, which boasts really fresh, flavorful ingredients. Favorites include Mixed Seafood & Vegetable Stew, Fettuccine & Chicken (but I substitute shrimp instead of chicken), and also the Baked Eggplant from the vegetarian menu. Also, the \"Pots\" of Eggplant Pate & Olive Tapenade with grilled flatbread could be a meal in itself.\n\nReasonable prices. I need to try more things on the menu, but I keep ordering the same things I love!","2850":"Wonderful food. We ordered some standards like steak and burgers. Pleasantly, they exceeded the standard. Better ingredients, better preparation, better experience. The coconut chiffon cake was again simple and perfect.","2851":"I had a wedding rehersal dinner on September 16 2016 for a party of 40 people. I must say the service was perfect the food was perfect and I was very pleased was everything. I tried call other places and never had near the awsome costumer service as I had at Jane's. I am very glad I had the dinner at Jane's and all the guests where also very pleased with everything. I highly recommend Jane's restaurants to everyone they are the best.","2852":"Very solid, \"high\" casual dining on State St.  We took our UCSB kid for a late dinner on a saturday night. I had a really good burger ( bun baked in house and rocked the burger), my kid had a beautiful filet and the wife a seafood soup. We all enjoyed the dishes and the help was outstanding. A bit noisy for intimate chatting but that's the only negative I found.","2853":"Let me state this first - my entree was very good - the chicken piccata. The server stated that it was only served with roast potatoes. I was so thankful that I checked yelp, I saw the entree was consistently served with pasta. So I requested fettuccine Alfredo as my pasta, which they provided. I was not impressed with the coconut cake  - the actual cake was very dry, but that was easily camouflaged by the layers of pudding and icing.  My mother, who is vegetarian, wasn't impressed with her portobello mushroom entree. Why didn't I give this restaurant 3 - 3 1\/2 stars? It's because of their service. My mother and I arrived at 2:15 pm, not knowing the restaurant closed at 2:30 pm for lunch. The restaurant host, Emma, looked at me with annoyance that I was there. She stared at me without saying anything for 10 seconds. Then she abruptly asked me if I was dining in. I said yes. Then she said, \"Well we close in 15 minutes, so you'll have to order quickly.\" I was simply shocked and taken a back at her rudeness. Emma unwillingly ushered us to our table. Then the waitress, Michele, came. She asked us immediately if we knew what we wanted to order. I told her no, it's our first time here. She then said we will have to order quickly because the kitchen will be closing soon. I  was completely disappointed at her immediate request and rudeness. I asked her what was the most popular dish - she said the chicken piccata. I ordered the chicken piccata, my mother ordered the portobello mushroom entree. I guess Michele was so focused on getting us out of the restaurant, she forgot to bring us our waters and forgot that we also ordered the coconut cake. Let me also mention that there were two groups of people that were seated before us, but hadn't order yet, that the staff  were very pleasant and accommodating to. While my mother and I quietly and quickly ate our dinner, two gentlemen came into the restaurant after 2:45 pm and asked Emma if they could order some burgers to go. It was obvious that they were very familiar to Emma  - she told them she would check with the kitchen. Please note: this was after 2:45 pm. She returned telling them the kitchen was closed, and that they wouldn't be able to order their food. She treated and responded to them pleasantly. I was shocked. So now, I realized Emma's attitude might've been personal. My mother and I quickly left. We walked by Emma, and she didn't acknowledge that we were departing, nor said goodbye, or said thanks for coming. This was my mother's and I first visit to Santa Barbra, and we had wonderful and memorable dining experiences at the Opal Restaurant, Finch and Fork, Andersen Danish Restaurant, Los Agaves, and others.  This was the first restaurant where the customer service experience was poor and horrible. The food was very delicious ... but  for me, customer service and quality of food goes hand-in-hand. Jane completely failed in customer service. I'm having an upcoming conference in Santa Barbara, and was looking for great restaurants to recommend to conference attendees. Jane will NOT be on my recommendation list; my recommendation to Jane - train your manager and wait staff to be hospitable to ALL customers, whether they arrive at 11:15 am or 2:15 pm. No customer should feel like that they're an inconvenience, or interrupting your staff's day.  UPDATE: I reviewed other patrons' reviews and noticed there was a consistent theme regarding Jane's poor service. In 99% of all poor - average reviews, the host was mentioned as the initial provider of poor customer service and lack of hospitality, followed by the wait staff. That speaks volumes!","2854":"Came here from a friend's recommendation and left feeling very satisfied. The restaurant is very cute with high ceilings, two sides of mezzanine levels, yet oddly still maintains a quaint feel. We walked in seeing an open table for two. The manager asked if we had a reservation and seemed a little stunted when we said no. Maybe consider making one if you're celebrating a special occasion?\nAnyway, we ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast and a Grilled Hawaiian Ono. One word: delicious! Both dishes came with veggies and potatoes, both were moist and both had great accompanying sauces. We topped off our meal with the Coconut Cream Cake and though the exterior cream was not a favorite, the rest of the cake was scrumptious and I would recommend it. Jane's great, give it a try!","2855":"Ya this is the spot. Great service. Fresh and delicious food. Epic ambiance. We eat here every time we are in SB","2856":"I've eaten at Jane several times but yesterday made me think twice about coming back.\nThe waitress was wonderful, very attentive and got the food out quickly.\nHaving said that the iced tea was great, she left a liter carafe to let us refill it ourselves which was a nice touch.  \nThe fish and chips were okay.  The coating on the fish (deep-fried) was totally overcooked, dried and a deep dark brown....almost burnt looking.\nMy salad with prawns and ahi was just okay.  The prawns seemed a little dry, without much flavor and the ahi was completely over-seared a light  brown with no pink in sight.\nI think the cook just wasn't paying attention and we ended up paying for his inattentiveness.  The place was busy for lunch but I'm disappointed the food wasn't up to par.  Sorry Jane, I love you but come on...","2857":"Wow! I love meat, and I can honestly say that I had the best filet mignon of my life here. It was cooked to complete perfection. I've just tried the meat, but I bet everything else has the same standard.","2858":"Jane is a cute restaurant. It looks small from the outside, but is actually pretty large. They have seating on the first floor, 2 second floor areas and a patio on the second floor. They have a pretty good selection of food on the menu. \n\n===Service===\n\nFrom the beginning the service was friendly. The hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us up on the second floor. Our waitress was very helpful in choosing a dish. Great service. \n\n===Food===\n\nEl Macho burger: Pasilla chile, jack cheese, avocado, onion, tomato and a spicy chipotle aioli. The burger wasn't spicy at all, but it was still good. I love any juicy burger that is topped with avocado. 4\/5\n\nGrilled chicken breast: Cilantro, Anaheim chiles, onions, tomatoes and cream. The sauce wasn't too heavy which I thought it was going to be. The chicken was cooked perfectly with the skin on. It was also served with steamed broccolini and a scalloped potato. The scalloped potato was just absolutely delicious! 4\/5\n\nCoconut cake: I'm not a huge fan of coconut. Actually I'm more towards the side that hates coconuts, but this cake was so light and fluffy and not too sweet. It was a great dessert to end the meal. \n\nNext time I'm in Santa Barbara I will gladly come back to Janes. I also recommend you trying it out for yourself since I had a great time and a delicious meal here at Janes.","2859":"I keep trying this place - only because friends like it.  But out of 5 or 6 tries, the food is always awful!  There are so many great restaurants in Santa Barbara that I don't quite understand why this one survives!!\n\nLast night we went for a pre-theater dinner.  So we were there right when they opened.  So there should be no excuse for bad food - wrong!!!  We both ordered fairly quickly, to ensure we would receive the food in time to eat it in a leisurely manner.  Well - it arrived in about one minute!  Which made me a bit suspicious to start off with...\n\nBut then I tasted my veal scallopini.  Yuk!!!  I probably should have sent it back.  It was luke-warm and the sauce was a bit gelatinous.  Seems as though it had been pre-prepared and was awaiting the first sucker to order the veal!  I am quite sure about this, because the vegetables were hot, steamy and crisp.  Quite a contrast!  Also, the portion I received was quite small.  Only one very small piece of veal.  And the only flavor was of dried parsley.  Can't they even afford fresh parsley!?\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken and it was also dried out and didn't have much sauce.  Seems perhaps my assessment that our dishes were pre-cooked for the pre-theater rush might be right!\n\nAnd then I became certain I was right!!!  The two ladies at the table adjacent to us just happened to order the same two dishes.  Theirs looked amazing and were steaming and clearly HOT!!!  Unlike ours.  To add insult to injury, the lady with the veal had two large pieces of veal, not one skimpy one.\n\nLike I said - I guess some people have good meals at 'Jane', but I never have, and I certainly won't be back again.  Been talked into this place for the last time!!!","2860":"What a cute place with yummy food and the service was great...what a rarity these days!\n\nWe had the red rings (best onion rings you will ever have), chicken breast and steak sandwich and they were all very tasty.  \n\nMy only regret is that we didn't have more time to enjoy there as we were headed to a concert at the bowl.  This is a great restaurant to grab a bite before heading over there as it is not that far away.","2861":"My family likes to try new places so when my son said Jane I was excited to try a place I always wanted to eat at. Getting seated at our table at 8:45 after a 45 min. wait we ordered a appetizer of onion rings and waited and waited. 40 min later our rings arrived. \nBy the time we had sat down Jane was emptying out so the kitchen being busy was defiantly not the problem. About half way through waiting for our onion rings we had ordered so I was expecting our meal to arrive fairly soon after the appetizer. Nope, after another 30 min our meals arrived.    \nThe food: Onion Rings, great batter, way way way to greasy\nThe Clam Linguine: Tiny pinky nail sized clams in a parsley sauce. I say parsley sauce because that's all I could taste and way to salty. No flavor profile at all.\nThe Chicken Piccata: My Son love the piccata although the fact he left the Fettuccine on the plate tells me all I need to know about that.\nThe Fish Sandwich: My wife's choice did not go over very well both at the table or later in the bathroom. French fries were over cooked as well. \nThe  Half Papaya & Dungeness Crab salad: My Daughter liked this and so did I. \n\nThe service: very disjointed but very pleasant. Had to ask for bread while we waited forever our appetizer. \n\nThe aftermath: My Son & I had cramps that night and diarrhea the next day, my Wife's dinner came out the other end the night before.","2862":"Fresh, fast, affordable. LOVE ITTT. Gluten free options, very accommodating. Nice staff. Will definitely be coming back :)","2863":"Salmon & Goat Cheese Pancakes - I could eat 15.\nCoconut Cake - literally the only cake I ever want again.\nMussels and Capeletti - exactly how mussels should be served and there were plenty of them.\nOnion Ring Appetizer - Good but not worth a letter home.\n\nEveryone in my party was pleased with their dinning experience \n\nAlso of note this restaurant is super cute! It looks exactly like the cute cafe in Portugal from the end of the movie Love Actually.","2864":"I love this restaurant. My go to place for first dates. The atmosphere is very quiet and has a nice ambiance. Staff has been impeccable every time I've gone.\n\nI ordered the chicken piccata the first time I went and I get it every time I go now. The other things on the menu are also great (I take bites out of other people's food haha) but there's no reason for me not to order the piccata every time. It's that good. \n\nDinner for two usually costs me around $40-70 depending on how much my date drinks and whether she orders appetizers and desserts. Worth every penny","2865":"Ben is the most accommodating, knowledgeable waiter and the food is divine!  The appetizers we loved were the onion rings and the clams. We had the seafood pasta with the most delicious sauce. The restaurant is packed. We were at the best restaurant in Santa Barbara with the most charming waiter. Highly recommend and we will be back.","2866":"Great place and great atmosphere. Friendly staff and cozy feel. The profile says not good for kids but we brought our infant and sleeping 3 year old and they were very accommodating. All of the pasta dishes were delicious as was the duck.  Will definitely be back!!!","2867":"Wonderful food, rich complex flavors, thought provoking & delicious!\nMercedes was professional, attentive & her suggestions were spot on.\nHighly recommend this restaurant, lovely memory with family & delicious food","2868":"1311 State St, Santa Barbara:\n\nI could not help falling in love with Santa Barbara's Victorian style Fine Dining Restaurant--- the food is so delicious (unique and thorough lunch and dinner menus; Friendly and welcoming waitstaff,\n\nJane's unique architecture and cozy, smaller  restaurant environmentenvironment makes you feel like you're back in the Victorian era -- sipping tea, all types of wines and the window seats are the best for  Upper State St people watching","2869":"Love this place!\nLast night, my Latina asked me where can we find a place that served the same food as Jane where we live? Why try? We drove two hours to the original. If that isn't love then I don't know what is -- maybe donating an organ might be the next best thing. The Latina had the seafood pasta, unfortunately it was made without the scallops (they were out). Trust her, it's better with. I had the simple cheeseburger and it was good. Overall we love coming to this place. On a busy night be prepared to wait for a table and the bathroom (they only have two). Happy dinning!","2870":"In Santa Barbara for the day working and I came to this place for lunch.  Food was really good.  Ben the waiter suggested chicken and Brie sandwich with Caesar salad and was excellent.  Solid customer service too.  Very nice atmosphere too.  Would definitely come back","2871":"This place is amazing! The food was spectacular! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata; it is exquisite!","2872":"Great food, good value, and great ambiance but service was really slow and the people that arrived at the table next to us were eating before we had ordered. Had to ask for everything from water to bread. Perhaps it was because we were located upstairs but the service left a lot of room for improvement. We waited 20 minutes for our appetizer salads and the salad plates were not cleared before main entree was served. I think if they could improve the quality of service that would really improve the experience.","2873":"The only thing good about this place are the red onion rings.\n\n1. We literally waited for 10 minutes to just get water. Meanwhile, a couple seated after us was already on their first course.\n\n2. It took an additional 10 minutes to place our order. Sidenote: later on there was a family of 4 who seriously waited 20 minutes before getting water, another 15 to place their order, and then another 20 to get their food. Yes, we were there that long.\n\n3. The HOSTESS was awesome, she was super cute and tiny and did seriously 90% of the work there. Changing table clothes, serving food, seating customers, etc. From what we could see, the other waitress was on top of her game as well. We just got unlucky with the ADD waitress.\n\n4. The food was meh. Don't order salads. They are glorified bags of lettuce. Trout salad was bland with not a lot going on. Chinese Scallop salad was also bland, had to add salt to even taste a thing.\n\nThis place could have been good, but we got unlucky with terrible service. Won't go back, won't recommend.","2874":"Jane is the perfect classic \"locals\" gourmet family-owned restaurant. They are consistently successful in providing a pleasant dining experience. The food, service, and warm ambiance is savory and beautiful. Jane is one of my faves. I highly recommend! I only wished they opened for dinner at 5 instead of 5:30 as we are early diners. ;)","2875":"Been here a few times now. The chicken picatta is pretty good, a bit on the salty side. Service is a hit or miss. I've never been greeted by a host, just the question \"how many?\" Also a bummer that they don't have a full bar. Ben, however, was an excellent server. He was very attentive and let me sample the sangria when I was deciding on a drink.","2876":"Everything was exquisite. The service and the food. A group f 5 of us al had different meals and all of it was outstanding. Do not miss the red onion rings r the mocha cake. We never wanted for anything and yet they had many large parties going on.","2877":"The food was great and creative.  The prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere was very nice.  \n\nI definitely recommend the Brie and apple fritters salad with maple syrup dressing!  The Fettuccine with lamb sausage was interesting but very good.  My date ordered the Duck Special with Blackberries...I stole a bite and it was yummy.  The white wine with apples (can't remember the name) was definitely worth ordering.\n\nThe only downside was that it was probably the worst service I've ever had in my life.  The waitress didn't break the bread (which everyone else had) and when I asked her for some, she didn't bring it until 5 minutes later.  My date ordered a beer which she never brought, but managed to put on the bill; when he asked her about it she seemed confused.  The other waiters\/waitresses seemed to be taking care of everyone else okay, so I'm guessing this was a particular waitress.\n\nIn any case, we'll probably be going back for the awesome food and hopefully won't draw the short stick on the waitress again.","2878":"Food was delicious.  Went there with my wife and I had the salmon, which was incredible.  My wife had the pork loin, and she enjoyed that as well.  We also shared the coconut cake for dessert, and it was a life-changing experience!\n\nOur waiter was excellent, very helpful but not overbearing and encouraged us to take our time.  The atmosphere was also very romantic and classy, and was price reasonably.  Very pleased!","2879":"We brought some friends to Jane this past Wed. night for a birthday Dinner celebration, they enjoyed everything , birthday sign had been put on the table, appetizers were amazing, entrees delicious, chicken piccata the best in SB, of course then the desert, coconut cake fabulous, Jane was there, always attentive to asking how things are and if we need anything, server great, beautiful ambiance, we celebrate many family birthdays at Jane, always very special. Best in SB","2880":"Love their salads! Also the interior is super cute with stringed lights and a sleek upstairs area. Service is quick and friendly and the menu is pretty diverse and can satisfy many different palates. Would recommend bringing family here for lunch","2881":"This place has a real sophisticated charm about it. Close to the ocean, near the strip, and has the most amazing lunch menu. I would love to go back for dinner. I had the portobello burger, on a homemade buttery bun, and my husband had the greek salad. The food was flavorful, and the atmosphere itself was enchanting. I loved it! We just happen to fall upon it as we walked around with no real destination and I am so glad we did. I really appreciated the genuine smiles by the staff and waitress, as well as the hostess.  I highly recommend Jane's, if you live in Santa Barbara--or are just visiting--it's a must.","2882":"Really poor service by a cranky, \"really should quit \" waitress. I usually empathize as I waitressed for several years in my working life but this one was just rotten and really unexpected from a usually reliably wonderful dining experience . \"Chops and fries\" served literally 2 tiny chops FROM a lamb rack for $27! NOT two lamb chop racks. Scandalous! And then over cooked. Worst part was how the waitress reacted when we express our sincere disappointment...she was arrogant! \"That's  how it's served. (Frown, arms crossed) Says so right there in the menu.\" Said we could have ONE other chop( proudly) for and additional fee! Really set on that appeasing me. After exhausting us of that \"solution\" reluctantly offered to return and replace the meal with another. We were on tight schedule for a show which we had told her of and she had already not rushed our food as we requested...so at that point- 45 min after having been seated-@5:30- time didn't allow for it. Pissed!","2883":"I recently had an absolutely delicious meal at Jane's and can't wait to go back! The atmosphere was warm and cozy (although it helped that the place was decorated for Christmas). We had a reservation, which looks like it is a must for a Saturday night since our table was the only one open in the place. I had delicious pasta with grilled lamb sausage. The sausage had a nice spice to it that wasn't overpowering, and the pasta sauce was rich, creamy, and delicious. For dessert, I had creme brulee and tasted a bite of my friend's coconut cake--both were delicious. The service was friendly and attentive, and I felt that the prices were very reasonable for such an excellent dining experience.","2884":"Our family loves Jane! It is our go to spot to celebrate special occasions or when we want to be sure to have an excellent meal. We have a range of characters in our extended family and this is one of only a few places that pleases everyone. The parent's also appreciate that their children's menu offers the option of fish or chicken with cooked vegetables and potatoes, alongside the items you'd expect to find (my daughter also loves the pasta). In fact, our son ate his first restaurant meal here and finished the entire plate!! \n\nWe normally exit at Mission and park on state above the restaurant. Reservations recommended!","2885":"This is a delightful restaurant. Loved the mussels in pernod cream sauce, the lamb sausage and the coconut cake. Stephanie was a very attentive and thoughtful server, and they had Meiomi Pinot noir. Make reservations....","2886":"I loved everything about this place, from the ambience to the food to the service. The dimmed restaurant with the string of lights draped across the ceiling definitely gave it a romantic air. But at the same time, I thought this place was perfect for a girls' night out too. It was cozy and intimate. \n\nMy friend and I started with the pots of eggplant pate and olive tapenade with grilled flat bread. I didn't care for the eggplant pate too much, but the olive tapenade was amazing! I couldn't get enough! It was just salty enough with tons of flavor. For our entrees, we both ordered the seared ahi and broiled prawns salad. It was a good sized meal, but one that didn't weigh you down. It was super light and so fresh! The seared ahi was perfect! The prawns were big and cooked just right. The ahi wasn't chewy and had this beautiful color to it. I was impressed. For dessert, we split Jane's sundae. There were large chunks of homemade toffee on top of vanilla ice cream with sweet caramel at the bottom of the glass. No whipped cream or cherry on top. This was a grownup's ice cream sundae. It was simple and elegant.\n\nService was excellent from beginning to end. I will definitely be back to try their onion rings and coconut cake!","2887":"Great selection of food and wine. So you can be naughty here and order one of their burgers or a little nice and order one of their great salad like the papaya and crab.","2888":"Attractive place on State Street with super-friendly staff and a diverse menu. We requested a quieter table and were given a great spot on the second-floor outside balcony, behind red, white, and blue bunting. The air was fresh and we could watch the passersby below. Staff were exceedingly attentive and courteous, and dinner was familiar American fare. The coconut cake is one of the best we've had, and the cr\u00e8me anglaise as good as homemade.","2889":"Yum! The bf and I were looking for an early dinner. We walked into Jane with no reservation and were seated in a table by the front window (yay!) \n\nThe waiter was attentive, good, not great, but good enough. And the food was QUITE yummy from the daily special of seabass with blackberry sauce (who'dda thunk? yum!) and the seafood stew which was creamy and not too over the top. Jane and Montecito Cafe do a great job of not overdoing with the curry and Asian inspired flavors (if I want Thai food\/flavor, I'll go to a Thai restaurant). \n\nReally delicious! Our appetizer of mussels with pernod cream was over-the-top good, like I-want-to-drink-the-sauce-gimme-more-bread-to-sop-it-up good! A must have! And the lemon cake dessert was to-die-for (the bf \"Hoovered\" it up and is not a dessert person). \n\nAs we ate dinner the place filled up quite quickly and I noticed that there seemed to be a higher than normal number of women. I blame the cream sauces, they seem to love cream sauces at Jane. I'm not complaining, not at all, but the bf initially gave the menu a once over and said, \"do they put cream sauce on everything??\" \n\nNo they don't, but if they did I'd still think it was fab!\n\nIf you're not watching calories or fat grams and love cream sauces, you must try Jane!","2890":"Rustic atmosphere. Perfect for small to large groups. Family owned!\n\nCorking fee $15. A little steep, but worth it if you bring you own wine.\n\nThe bread rolls were like mini pillows. The onion rings so crispy! Jane has many different types of salads to choose from - my heart belongs to the spinach, beet and goat cheese! The filet mignon was juicy, tender and so tasty! \n\nIf there is any more room left - must get the HOME MADE soft serve ice cream with raspberry sauce.","2891":"Waitresses are 20 year olds who were not familiar with the most basic customer service.  Our waitress took a long time to get us water.  She wasn't able to handle a basic request in replacing french fries with fruit or vegetables.   There were some drops of spilled water on the table and the waitress actually told my husband to wipe it up himself and gave him a dishcloth.  Of course, they automatically added a tip to our bill because we were a group!  \n\nIt seems to be a place for old people who lunch.  We were the youngest people there by a mile.  \n\nIn terms of the food, it was uneven.   I had salmon and prawn salad. The fried fish was pretty fresh and tender.  The prawns were grilled and good, but the salmon was 2 thin wafers of what appeared to be store-bought farmed smoked salmon.   The oven baked chicken was very dry.","2892":"Absolutely fabulous meal.  I had the chicken piccata and it was the best I have ever had.  Others in our group had filet and raved about it.  We also enjoyed the Coconut cake.  It was phenomenal!  The atmosphere and service were great.  Our favorite meal in Santa Barbara!","2893":"I was up in Santa Barbara for my beloved sister's bachelorette party last week, and we had dinner at Jane the first night. What a great start to an amazing weekend of good food and good company!\n\nThings I loved about Jane:\n1. The setup and feel of the restaurant. It is great for a nice dinner date, but also perfect for a night out with the girls or even a family dinner. The versatility is due to the fact that the restaurant is cozy and makes you feel at home. I especially loved sitting at a table upstairs! Tres European!\n\n2. The onion rings & the mussels! You can't go without these two appetizers. They were a wonderful start to the meal, and perfect to share!\n\n3. Their baked goods. Just the right amount of sweet and moist!\n\nI'd love to go back to SB and to Jane! :)","2894":"I'm the kind of clever guy with a pragmatic wife who may find himself celebrating Valentine's day the Saturday after to avoid the crowds, shady pre-set menus, and iffy service.  That's how I found myself in Santa Barbara looking for a nice restaurant to go to with my wife, without reservations (ressies).  I called up Jane an hour or so before opening, maybe a little less, and they told me they were fully booked but if I came when they opened they may be able to squeeze us in.  Since we were already nearby, I walked over and staked a claim on the two person bench immediately outside.  What happened next I can't definitively explain, but some girl walked past me and my look of disdain and looked at me sheepishly after she saw the door was locked.  She lingered, and soon a crowd started gathering.  Were they merely hungry and intrigued by a couple people waiting for this place to open?  Or did they already know about Jane?  I'll never know, but I do know we were first and got seated immediately.  I had Sangria and my wife had a glass of wine someone on another review suggested, both great.  I had the duck breast and my wife had the chicken piccata (I think I posted pics) which were both excellent.  We also split the onion rings as an app which felt to me to be a must get.  I LOVE ONION RINGS AND I THINK THESE MAY BE THE BEST.  I'm sorry for shouting but if you're skimming reviews didn't want you to miss that bullet point.  Anyway, I had this great coconut cake to finish and took a slow mo video on my iPhone of my fork dropping into it.  Epic.  All in all a truly wonderful experience and a great place to get out to a few times a year if you can.","2895":"Fantastic service, our waitress was super nice and we got our food quickly. Very affordable pricing which was even more of a bonus once we tasted the food, which was delicious. They were also flexible with the orders, allowing us to swap meats or ask for extra sauce without any fuss.","2896":"Delicious! I recommend anyone visiting or living in Santa Barbara to try Jane downtown! The have a nice upstairs patio area fit for two people as well.","2897":"We had dinner reservations and were seated right away. The decor of the place is very cute. Our waitress was nice but not overly friendly. However, the food here is very good. For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee and it was delish! Everyone in my party was pleased with their meals and we will definitely be coming back here again.","2898":"The overdressed salad greens with one single wedge of unripe tomato was not appetizing at all.  I ordered the filet mignon with oyster mushroom sauce.  There was only 1 single small piece of mushroom on my plate.  The chef cut halfway through my steak to check for doneness. Did he let the steak rest before cutting? If he couldn't tell how done the steak was without cutting it open,  then he should not be a chef! The waitress was not friendly or helpful.  We had to fill our own water, and once the food arrived she never checked in with the table to see if we needed anything (which we did). For the prices they charge I expect a little more effort on all fronts.  Pick somewhere else to go instead!","2899":"Heard great things about this place, and it lived up its reputation - it was excellent. Small, nice atmosphere, friendly service.  Tried the appetizer special of artichoke halves stuffed w\/ Dungeness crab (yum), then seafood stew (really good) and chicken picatta (wonderful flavor; I think the best I've ever had.  This place is definitely going to be a must-visit every time I come to Santa Barbara.","2900":"The Best Onion Rings I Ever Had= their Firestone Red Rings! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=AG-oRAkUoglPXJZWXLBuOg\n\nHighly rated on yelp and trip advisor, my friend's wanted to check this place out for dinner and our last stop in Santa Barbara. I really wanted to try their Apple Fritter and Fried Brie Salad, so we got that and the Red Rings for our appetizers. I'm so glad we got the Red Rings, cuz they were my favorite things of the whole meal. The battered red onion rings were perfectly done-drizzled with balsamic and came with a spicy herb cream that i could handle, these were a favorite among us and also highly loved by other yelpers. The Salad was also highly rated, but it was not as good as i was hoping. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=2H-Ho47NK5CahjqQO0Xh7w Although my friends liked it, there was something about it, i couldn't quite place that i didn't enjoy- and i normally love brie and apples! The maple dressing over the mixed greens and the pecans were delicious tho. \n\nFor my main dish, I got the fresh grilled seabass sandwich with avocado, water cress, dill mayo and daikon sprouts.http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=MciH9xlHNG3A2Ak7dERShw i didn't care for the wheat bread it came on, and i am going to add Water Cress to my list with cilantro and star anise. Fries were pretty good that came with.\n\nI loved dude's order of Fettuccini with lamb sausage, spinach, tomatoes and garlic. This was super yummy, i ate more of this than my sandwich. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=_3x4fm7Gx4MkLFL51W37ew\nMy friend got the seafood soup http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=____BAMZB4HAXMKiJT40nQ , which was a bit salty but a favorite of her hubbys. Her hubby had the El Macho burger- which i had a few bites and enjoyed- (wasn't too spicy!). http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=IuS5oUpp16zgKoylL1Pm4A\nWe had to order a slice of the coconut cake, which was mentioned alot in reviews. It was a very generous slice, with tons of coconut shavings and yummy cream. Very Good, but i probably could go without next time.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/iBBV8vesQ8fo2IQA7an1JA?select=MP8PfR2RHva5Gl3PvzjIvQ\n\nOverall, a very good meal, good attentive service. Very cute place! We were here for almost two hours and it was not too busy. As it gets crowded, i can see how service would slow down, so plan accordingly!","2901":"This is a great lunch or dinner spot with a wide variety of comfort food.  The location is epic - next to the Arlington.  I only wish it as a little more private inside - kinda loud.  Service is professional.","2902":"Great food and ambience.  Get the red rings.  Wine list can improve.","2903":"WOW is all I have to say.  I am generally highly critical about restaurants, but this place hit all the great points.  Atmosphere, staffing, and of course, the food.   Jane is a gem amongst so many generic places on State street.  It has a cozy feeling, which lets you know that its family owned, but still has a contemporary edge.  The waiting staff was friendly and knew the menu thoroughly.  I ordered the duck breast which was amazing.  I think duck is a tricky cut of meat, especially since it can easily be undercooked or overcooked and chewy.  This was just right.  It was complemented by the port wine reduction and cranberry and apples which it was served with.  Although Im not from Santa Barbara, I would say its worth going back there for this place.","2904":"What an amazing find!\n\nWhile wandering around town for the weekend, we literally stumbled into Jane.\n\nThe attentive service, the *incredible* food (we had lunch -- the chicken & fried-brie sandwich and the bay scallop salad were equally divine) & the overall warmth of the place had us swooning.\n\nWould drive up from L.A. without a second thought just to eat here again (and again).\n\nWow.","2905":"Absolutely loved this place! We went for a friends birthday last week and all 7 of us really  enjoyed our dinner. Definitely a great place for a romantic dinner or a larger group. I had the duck breast and was really pleased with the dish. Another member of my group got the seafood stew which was delicious! Highly recommend that dish. Overall fantastic food, great service and great ambiance. Will definitely be back!\n\nP.S. The coconut cake is a MUST try!!!!!!!","2906":"Another great find with Yelp. Ambience is spot on. Fish stew is light and fresh with premium fish and garden fresh vegetables. Chicken piccata is perfect flavored (far superior to the standard lemon caper style) with perfectly filleted chicken breast, snow peas and spinach. Highly recommend.","2907":"Food and dessert was great, not too oily or heavy. Scallop salad was a solid 5\/5. Jane sundae was 5\/5. Not a bad Saturday night!! Great ambiance.","2908":"Excellent food. Excellent service. We had our dog with us and so they brought a table out in the front for us with four chairs so we can eat with him. The hamburgers, specifically the Jane burger and El Macho, are some of my favorite Burgers anywhere. Is the bread is perfect for the combination of well-tendered meat as well as perfectly cooked onions and other seasonings. Not to mention the cheese which accents everything in a beautiful Harmony of tastebud delight.","2909":"I attended a small wedding reception at Jane and was very impressed. The staff was extremely courteous and anticipated every need. The food was a generous portion and absolutely delicious. Comfortable atmosphere, but more geared towards adults (although they did have a child's menu with a good selection). I would love to come back for a romantic dinner. Very small, so call ahead.","2910":"Went to Jane for lunch and to complete some work during the 80 degree weather in January. As such, I snuck out onto the balcony on the 2nd level overlooking State St and chose that as my spot for my first Jane experience. \n\nAlthough there was no one at the door to greet, one of the friendly servers quickly came over to say hello and seat me. I already knew I wanted a salad and was pleased with the selection of salads (and sandwiches) they have on their menu, as well as the 1\/2 salad 1\/2 sandwich lunch special. I went with the delicious romaine and gorgonzola with bacon, which was perfectly accompanied by a pint of stella. \n\nThe FOOD was good, my portion of romaine salad was a bit smaller than anticipated (given the recent trend of restaurants to make everything HUGE) but I was filled. There was an even distribution of tomatos, bacon, gorgonzola, lettuce and it was not overpowered by dressing. I also like the ciabatta roll and the quaint carafes of water they bring out to refill your water glass. \n\nThe SERVICE was friendly and frequent yet not overbearing, although I was 1 of about 7 tables in the entire restaurant, so not very busy... but don't be fooled I've walked by and there are people pouring out of every window and door. \n\nWas just what I was looking for on a nice sunny afternoon for a solo lunch in Santa Barbara!","2911":"Cute little restaurant in Santa Barbara. I went a few years ago and was blown away by their delicious chicken piccata. Came back recently and it was still delicious!  The chicken is Crispy and the sauce is amazing, pairs well with the fettuccine alfredo (although the heavily buttered veggies might not have been necessary). Apple fritter and Brie salad was good, although I wish the apples had been cooked more before frying. Other items were a little lack luster though - the pound cake was a little too eggy and tasted more like a coffee cake. It wasn't light enough, not sure if it was that the ingredients weren't mixed properly or if it had been refrigerated. Either way the waitress was kind enough to take it off. :) good service, and I like that the recipes are all family recipes. Overall a good place with a great chicken piccata :)","2912":"Very cute restaurant, cozy feel with good food and wine. \n\nAmazingly walked in on a Saturday night and got a table within 20 minutes.\n\nRecommend.","2913":"I was underwhelmed by this place BUT maybe I ordered the wrong thing...I got the Gorgonzola salad with steak. And while it was a pretty good salad, it was nothing spectacular or really all that different from any other steak salad with cheese and bacon. I can say the bacon was tasty and they cooked my steak to temp as asked, but nothing stood out about the meal.","2914":"This restaurant is a great place for lunch or dinner, I used to work just a block away and would frequently enjoy my lunch there. Great wine list! I have enjoyed all the salads, fresh organic ingredients, the bay-scallop salad was one of my favorites. It is located close to the Arlington Theater. Being a SB native, it was always fun to check out all the great new restaurants.","2915":"FINALLY!! A restaurant that helped me stop missing Chad's! \n\nWhile Santa Barbara has an abundance of beautiful restaurants with good food, restaurants like Jane will always top my favorites list with their simple and beautifully delicious food and relaxed elegance. With its Spanish-style interior, cozy fireplace, and both indoor and outdoor balcony seating, the space offers both open and intimate tables for large parties or quiet first dates and everything in between.\n\nI've been twice for dinner in the past month (once for my wedding anniversary and once on a girls' night out). Kyla was our server on both nights, and she was perfect. She helped with wine suggestions (I had the syrah, and it was lovely.), knew exactly what was going on with the specials and even offered to substitute with a local seabass when it turned out they'd run out of whatever fish it was supposed to be that night, and maintained our table attentively and without intrusion. As for the food, the coconut shrimp appetizer was ridiculous, and both the seabass special and the cedar plank salmon I tried were unbelievable. I might have licked my plate, if that were even remotely acceptable. And my husband said the lamb was probably the best he's ever had.\n\nA couple minor flaws I am totally willing to overlook (but there's always room for improvement, right?) are that 1) the bread they serve while you wait is served cold (not room temp, more like lightly refrigerated). All the girls were surprised it wasn't warm and commented on it as soon as they reached into the basket. And, 2) the creme brulee left a little to be desired. The portion is way too big for one person, and the sugar crust was way too thick, throwing the proportions off a bit and making it so the top had to be heated longer, which melted the custard a bit.\n\nBut, really, by the time we were done it was easy to let go of those minor details. The price is right for a nice night out, the food is unreal, and the staff work hard to make you feel at home. Jane is definitely a new favorite and has become my new go-to suggestion for lunch or dinner downtown.","2916":"The food and service were very good. I am anxious to return to try more things. The Chicken Piccatta and coconut cake are every bit as good as everyone claims!","2917":"This and Montecito Cafe is my husband and my favorite restaurant. The food and service is wonderful! Love the chicken picatta!","2918":"Jane is a great restaurant!   The food is reasonable, the quality is great and the service is friendly.   \n\nWent there this past weekend to visit a friend who was back in town for a visit.   There were 15 in our group.   \n\nI started with a beer and and my wife and I ordered the Pasilla Chili.   More often than not it comes very mild but every now and then it is hot-hot-hot.   This was one of those times!    But still my favorite appitizer!   \n\nI had the Chicken Piccatta and my wife had the Papaya, and Crab salad.   We both really enjoyed our meal.\n\nI think with tax and a 20% tip it was just about $60.    Not bad for what we got!    \n\nI recommend!","2919":"Had dinner here again the other night...who am I kidding! This place deserves 5 stars. Food is ridiculously good.","2920":"Awesome food. Really enjoyed every bite of all the dishes. food was amazing so does the ambience.","2921":"I've only been here once for lunch, but the experience was pretty good.  I had a salad with seared ahi and shrimp with butter lettuce.  That was very satisfying and light, but I think a bit pricey (I wasn't paying).  Everyone else had salads, and they were happy as well.\n\nThe creme brulee for dessert was AWESOME!  The portion was huge and it was perfectly decadent.  Definitely a dessert that at least two people can share.  A friend ordered the frozen yogurt with fresh berries.  It kinda looked like mcdonald's soft serve.  But the berries looked good.\n\nThe place is pretty cute on the inside, would be a great place for a girls' lunch.","2922":"Ambiance = 5. Food = 4. Wine = 5. Overall just a great dining experience. Lovely place, awesome service and would come back in a heartbeat. Goat cheese pancakes with salmon a must have! Grazie!","2923":"Jane is somewhere I go with my friends quite often.  It's a perfect balance between being a fun place to go when you feel like a nice dinner but not being required to dress up.  You could go in normal clothes and not feel out of place, but you could also go looking dressy and feel fine.  And of course the food is great!\n\nIt's good for lunch and dinner, but I prefer the dinner.  I've tried a lot of different dishes there but there are a few that are especially good; the fried brie and apple fritter salad and the grilled chicken and fried brie sandwich.  I know they both have fried brie, but you need to order one of them, and I suggest choosing only one at each meal.  They're just so good you will want them again and again!\n\nIf you're looking to be more healthy, the salad bowls are great, and there are plenty of interesting combinations.  However, they're not going to leave you craving another one.  The grilled fish sandwich is also delicious, and being a little lighter than the fried brie is a great choice!  The pastas that I've tried are pretty average and not worth getting when there are so many better things on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, the coconut cake is perfect, but best to be shared with a few people as the slices are big and you don't want more than a few bites.","2924":"Soooo yummy. The service was quick attentative and friendly. The filet mingion was cooked perfectly & the sauce delicious! My hubby had the chicken Alfredo which tasted great just nothing extra special. The lemonade was amazing sweet and sour perfection and the Cesar salad was good. The atmosphere was very romantic while we ate by candlelight hearing a wide variety of cool music. The only disappointment was the coconut cake! Not worth the $8 for the slice! \n\nThe waitress was very attentive and nice. \nCompliments to the chef for the delicious cooked filet, potatoes, and mushroom sauce. Definitely can not wait to go back since we live in LA, recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet romantic classy dinner by candlelight :)","2925":"Reading all of the reviews we chose this place to get a burger.  We ordered the linguini with lamb sausage. It was delicious!   Very nice portion size. They make their sausage and it was extremely flavorful. Pasta was very fresh with a nice cream sauce. If I HAD to complain about the dish, it would be that they thicken up he sauce so that it sticks better to the linguini but that is a very small complaint. \n\nWe tried the coconut cake. I generally do not care for coconut but the flavor was very subtle. \n\nThe service was terribly slow. We told our server we were going to share the pasta but when the food came we had to ask him for an additional plate and refills on water.  We had a gentleman that looked like a Ken Barbie doll. \n\nI give the food a 5 and the service a 3.","2926":"Recently enjoyed a wonderful and delicious lunch at this restaurant with family.Service was very attentive. Food was nicely presented and very scrumptious. Had the chicken piccata, the rest of the family had burgers. All were awesome. The place had a nice ambiance as well. Would definitely recommend if you are on State St. in Santa Barbara. Recommend making reservations.","2927":"Service is weak. Food is just fine. Definitely nothing special. I don't recommend eating here. There are so many other great places to eat really good food in Santa Barbara. Sadly, this is not one of them. I had read good reviews, so expected better. Maybe it was a bad night for them. I'll never know, because I'll never go back.","2928":"Wonderful dinner. The steak was superb. And our server was delightful.","2929":"Decor is cute, like something out of the movie \"Love Actually.\" Came here with our bachelorette party, group of 7 at around 8pm (after the dinner rush). Ordered at 8:15pm, got our food at 9:10pm. Wtf? It wasn't like we got complicated orders, we got fettuccini and chicken, clam linguine (which wasn't worth the $20-too much parsley and didn't have that much flavor), and the flank steak. No appetizers. Not sure what the hold up was, but we were not impressed. Our waitress was really kind, but sensed our hangryness. If you were to come here to eat, come full! It'll take a while before your food gets here. 2STARS!!!","2930":"Jane was Exceptional!  We started with the Apple Fritter and Fried Brie salad - and agree with other reviewers...this dish was incredible and takes Brie to a whole new level, amazing!  We also enjoyed the Soft Shell crab appetizer which was perfectly prepared.\n\nFor our main Course I enjoyed the Cedar Plank Salmon - perfectly cooked with a delicious Mango Salsa. Their Scallop potatoes are the best i've ever had the  broccoli was  fresh, vibrant, and tasty - I appreciate that they use the freshest organic ingredients - it shows in the food. My wife enjoyed the Swordfish - something I normally shy away from because it tends to be tough and dense. Somehow the chef has managed to prepare a moist and tender swordfish which was incredible...well done!! \n\nWe took home a pecan tart dessert which was scrumptious. Our wine was great and the selection of wines overall is good - but not great.  The only reason we didnt award five stars was the service - which was hurried and impersonal - a result of under staffing. For the money we spend - we appreciate having more attentive service where the server takes time to explain specials, etc. so room for improvement. OVERALL AMAZING EXPERIENCE and we will be back.","2931":"We had the turkey BLT with fries, I loved the bun and the fries were very tasty.  The sandwich did need a little extra salt and pepper but overall it was good.  The other sandwich we got was the chicken and brie with a cup of mushroom soup.  The soup was a little dissapointing thin and not hearty as I expect a mushroom soup to be. I would definitely return though","2932":"Jane was such a cute restaurant. The ambiance, decor, it was nice.\n\nThe food was delicious! My boyfriend got the chops and fries. It was a side salad with, fries and two pieces of lamb chops. He said the lamb was juicy and tender. I got the the Gorgonzola. It was a large entree salad with grilled chicken, gorgonzola, cherry tomatoes, bacon, and raspberry vinaigrette. It was delicious. \n\nI give the restaurant 4 stars because our water cups were dirty with things floating in it, and our waitress forgot our appetizer order. Overall it was good though.","2933":"We were running late to a different restaurant for my Moms Birthday dinner that would not serve us past the reservation time so we decided to look for another place. It seemed there was no other restaurant that would accommodate a party of 16 with only an hours notice. Jane was more then willing to help. We googled local restaurants and Jane had a price that was right and reviews which were very good. The food was delicious the service was great and the coconut cake was amazing. I'm very happy my Mom loved the food as well as the rest of my Family. I'm looking forward to going there again the next time we are in town. I defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area or anyone celebrating something special. This place gets 5 stars all around for presentation, service and food.","2934":"I went with a girlfriend for dinner in February.  We enjoyed the food, the ambiance was nice and our server was also very good.  I had a steak since the fish they advertised on the specials was a mistake, and not available.    I thought it was pretty good....it was a ribeye...a bit thin, not too tender but flavorful.  My friend had fish that she enjoyed.  I will go back and try again.","2935":"We pulled into town on a thursday night and after yelping decided to try this place. Loved the decor and charm of this place! The service was great and everything on the menu looked great. We settled on the fish sandwich and a glass of wine. The mushroom soup was ultra delicious! For dessert don't pass on the coconut cake, wow!","2936":"My wife and I went to Jane for our Anniversary on the recommendation of a southern California work friend.  The environment Is very friendly and welcoming; dress Is casual. Although they were busy hosting a wedding dinner, they were able to seat us quickly and the service was very good throughout our visit.  From bread to dessert everything was unique and very tasty.  I had a Hawaiian Salmon sandwich and my wife had BBQ burger - both were perfectly prepared.  The sourdough \"starter\" bread was very good as was the bun on both of our sandwiches.  Don't forget the fresh berries and ice cream for dessert!","2937":"I went here with my family and and the atmosphere is very cozy. Our waitress was sweet and made sure we were well taken care of. I started off with some of the best onion rings I've ever had! Their salad bowls are huge and packed with fresh ingredients. The asain scallop salad was to die for. We opted out of their signature coconut cake for some of their homemade ice cream with caramel sauce and it was a great choice.","2938":"Two words: Macho burger!  If you love burgers and spicy or even if you don't like neither, you will love this burger. It's the best you'll ever have. Eat it along with the red rings and some sweet potato fries and you're all set! My date had the duck dish and mentioned it was delicious as well. The atmosphere is quiet and romantic. The lights are dimmed and you feel at ease. Even though the place may be packed, you don't notice all of the commotion. I truly love everything I love about this place. It's definitely a must visit for anyone who comes out to SB!","2939":"I'm in love with a girl...and her name is Jane.  What a warm and welcoming restaurant.  Everything about the decor, service, and food is top-notch.  This family owned restaurant likes to keep it local, from the extensive wine list to the spectacular seafood.  My choice was the salmon on a cedar plank, accompanied with a mango relish and citrus cream.  WOW.  Perfectly grilled and intensely flavorful.  My mother had the penne pasta with shrimp, clams, and scallops.  The sweet aroma of basil, garlic, and olive oil lingered on our minds (and breath) for days.  Needless to say, plates were empty and bellies happy.  Bravo.","2940":"Ate here tonight. I called to make a reservation as we frequently visit the Santa Barbara Winery. I was told we didn't need a reservation as there are always some tables set aside for walk-ins. Good practice! More places should do this. Due to a concert starting at 7, there was a huge line outside the door before 5:30. All reservations were honored, but we still got a great table. I was worried that the service would be slow since the place was full, including two huge parties. I was wrong. The entire waitstaff worked like a well-oiled machine. Service was impeccable.\n  The restaurant is both charming and warm and just as I was saying all it needed was fire place, I turned around and there it was!  The Christmas decorations were thoughtful and made the dining experience all the more inviting. Now on to the food.\nThe bread is fresh and made at Our Daily Bread, just down the street. Enough said! I had the Split Pea Soup. It was piping hot, creamy, and delicious. For dinner we had the Steak Sandwich, Chicken Picatta, and Cheeseburger. The Sesame buns are made here! All were superb. For dessert the Coconut Cake is not to be missed. I can't wait to come back.","2941":"Sorry to say, my ahi and shrimp entree salad was mediocre.  Not a large enough serving of ahi to be classified an entree.  The cucumber noodles described in the menu turned out to be about a tablespoon of julienned cucumber.  Four skimpy slices of ahi, on a bed of mainly butter lettuce just doesn't do it.  Shrimp was fine, but couldn't carry the salad as an entree.  I won't be back for dinner.  The kitchen on this item totally lacking in finesse.","2942":"Wonderful food, great service and never disappointed. The ice cream sundae is the best i've ever had!!\n Sometimes the wait for a table at night can be up to 30 minutes if you don't have a reservation, so plan ahead!!","2943":"What a gem! Our server was very friendly and pretty =) We got clam linguini (dad LOVED it!), fire onion rings (really good), lamb fettucini (not great), chicken picatta (hubby really loved it!), burger for the son (loved it) and fish for mom (just okay). Would loved to try the coconut cake anglais next time with steak.","2944":"Try the Firestone onion rings with the balsamic glaze--yum, yum. The oyster stew was also very good.","2945":"A 5+ star experience. Excellent service, beautiful and flavorful dishes, and that COCONUT CAKE though. My, my, my...","2946":"Jane is one of my favorite places to celebrate with friends. From burgers to dessert it is all good. My fav's are the sweet potato fries and the Coconut Cake. Truly a fun environment that invites conversation with good friends.","2947":"Family owned eateries with a delectable assortment of fine, yet traditional American cuisine is surely declining in the Southern California region. However, Jane keeps it well alive in the Santa Barbara area. \n\nI came with four friends and we decided to splurge on a wide variety of different nourishments ranging from a finely cooked Filet Mignon steak to a Greek Salad. Our waitress was efficient and friendly, refilling our bread as we waited for our main entrees to arrive. The wait was not that long, around twenty to thirty minutes, typical of a restaurant of this caliber. The mark of a fine dining establishment is the seafood and the meats. Personally, I ordered the Filet Mignon ($31 tax included), a truly delectable dish that sets the standard for many of these classier eateries. As a personal preference, I enjoy my meats medium well, with the slight shade of red surrounded by a seared herb encrusted crust. The meat came perfectly, with a savory side of decadent potatoes and sliced salted cucumbers. Having frequented many steak house joints from Strip House in New York to the ever so famous Mastros in Beverly Hills, this steak was presentable and delicious. I would definitely highly recommend this dish. \n\nThey food itself is the main attraction of a fine establishment, however it is essential for the decor and ambiance to be favorable as well. Why would anyone wish to eat somewhere tight and uncomfortable? This eatery reminded me of the Italian countryside, with its kitsch design and it's extensive use of wood and wine bottles as decorations. Jane has an excellent ambiance, coupled with a elegant decor surely to draw future guests. There is certainly a charm to this family owned restaurant.","2948":"This place is super slow. I'm wondering if the food is good enough to be worth the wait. So, we were seated at 8:30pm for dinner and we didn't get our appetizer til after 9:30pm, WTF, really???? Then an hour & half later we got out entrees, serously! No food is worth having to wait that long. The place was full but that's no excuse. It just means that they don't have their act together in the kitchen. \n\nThe fettuccine & lamb sausage  was too rich for me and a bit bland in flavor. The lamb was good. The coconut cake was as good as everyone says.","2949":"Great Ambience and great service. Food was tasty. We tried the specials. Kids had pasta and enjoyed the bologna see and Alfredo. Wife said the wine was real good.....","2950":"Jane is one of our \"go-to\" restaurants. Quality food and service every time. I crave the Greek salad with lamb sausage, it is too good. We will keep coming back!","2951":"How can one not like this place. Ambience, wine choices, local knowledge, and food all divine. A wonderful spot for an intimate dinner for two on a perfect birthday evening.","2952":"Boyfriend and I ate here for the first time about a month ago encouraged by positive yelp reviews. We found the food surprisingly lack luster, even the starter bread didn't taste very fresh. We ordered the goat cheese pancakes, the highlight of our meal, unfortunately the portion size was tiny. For entrees, I ordered the mixed seafood and vegetable stew and my boyfriend ordered the chops and fries. He found his dish mediocre, I found mine mediocre but edible, until I began to develop a bad stomach ache. I don't have a particularly sensitive stomach so my suspicion is that the seafood was not particularly fresh. Another reviewer's mention of bad clams (curiously lacking elaboration, or a low rating) reinforces this idea.\n\nPerhaps we had a fluke experience but I doubt I will give Jane a second try.","2953":"Took my family (party of 7) to lunch for my daughter's graduation from UCSB.  Didn't know the exact time we would arrive but the hostess was very accommodating and had a lovely table waiting for us.  The atmosphere is charming, the food unique, fresh and delicious.  The onion rings are a must!  The salads, fish, and chicken dishes were all excellent. My husband ordered one of each dessert and they were out of this world!  The wine selection was quite nice as well.  I will definitely go back and suggest you give it a try as well.","2954":"A truly lovely little restaurant! Though kind of pricey, it's well worth it for a special occasion. We had the mussels and duck- wow. Both were excellent, highly recommend! Good portions too.\n\nAdditionally, every staff member went out of their way to be helpful and thank us for visiting. It's the little things :)","2955":"My girlfriend and i were just recently up in Santa Barbara celebrating her birthday when I decided I would try this place out for her b-day dinner.  We had been wine tasting a little in the afternoon so we were hungry and I was looking to see if the reviews would live up to the hype.  Well they did, and more.  For whatever reason I was craving fish-n-chips and I couldn't have been more pleased with the way it looked and tasted.  Not overly saturated in oil... but crispy... and the fish just melted in your mouth.  The fries were somewhat forgettable but the sauces (Chipotle Ketchup & Creamy Dill Dip) that came with the plate made up for it.  It was more than I could eat but I managed to take it all in.  My girl had the chicken picatta and she could do nothing but rave how wonderful it tasted.  The vegetables that accompanied the dish were crisp and the fettuccini was perfectly cooked.  But the service was exceptionally good as well.  We received our food within 10 minutes and the temperature was perfect.  I don't mind waiting for my food to cool down a little as I chat and have a few sips of wine.  It's certainly beats having it come out cold and having to send it back.  But the staff was extremely nice and very accommodating on my birthday desert request.  Try the flour less chocolate cake.  You won't believe that it's only 8$.  We had a terrific meal.  Two very nice glasses of wine, and a dessert for only $66!!!  This was the most amazing part of our experience.  It tasted like it was going to be a lot more.  I love when that happens.  EVERYOne loves when that happens!  So yes, I would go back again and again; that's how I rate a restaurant.","2956":"We love this place. What's so nice about Jane is it fits us whatever mood we're in. We can either take their one outdoor table for a casual mid-week family meal and order fries and burgers or go adults-only and order some of their other fantastic items - chicken piccata, cedar salmon, cocunut cake - all is delicious! Great local wines too!","2957":"I'd still go back to try other stuff but with less expectations. Walking on State St., we stumbled into this place and decided to step in because of the great-looking menu. The restaurant looked nice and warm too.\n\nFor starters, the fried brie with apple fritters salad. It had a nice and light dressing with the mixed greens but the fried brie and apple were rather large. I also would have liked a crunchier outer layer on the brie because when I think fried, I think crunchy. \n\nFor the main entree, I had the grilled duck which I thought was cooked nicely. Now, I expected the sauce to be sweet since it was going to have fruit and port but I think next time I would prefer a more savory sauce with my duck. I should have known better! My boyfriend had the grilled NY steak ordered how the chef would prefer it done. It looked so appetizing upon arriving on the table - very nice crust on the steak. But after cutting into it, we thought the inside was too rare for our liking and bled out too too much. Again, should have known better to ask for what we know we like. \n\nLast thing, don't come hungry. Be prepared to wait since the service can be slow.","2958":"Its more like a 4.2 rounded up but I needed to round up. The place is high ceilings, exposed beams with two balcony seating areas.  They have a shelf of wine running the length of the longest wall, fresh flowers in spots, a bar (limited seating) before the semi-open kitchen.  The place gives me a European vibe, like a Spanish or even Italian taverna feel.  They even have communal table, for the poor folk without a reservation or the adventurous friendly types.  Cool, either way to me!\nWine list was standard nothing to creative but a good selection and great price point.  Speaking of price point, amazing for Santa Barbara considering the atmosphere and quality.  \nHouse salad, pretty good size for the price, mixed field greens, tomato,  onion and I think daikon (hard to tell with dressing).  The dressing was red wine vinaigrette and I'd say it was a hair creamy.  Good red wine vinegar flavor.  \nI had the penne pasta with shrimp, clams, scallops and I substituted the sauce for the pesto saute with light cream.  DAMN it was good.  Shrimp was standard...a bit over cooked but fine tasting and a bit tough.  The clams were really good but only had a few.  Definitely from the Pacific, they didn't pack a punch when you bit into them (if you're from New England you'll have to pass on these).  The scallops were not scallops in my opinion  My best example, a thick lima bean.  i almost said there were no scallops then I saw one wedged in a piece of penne and thought \"no shit, that explains $18.  I really wanted to try the lamb sausage but meat wasn't hitting the spot that night.  My one guest had the filet, cooked really well, not the best piece of meat but that's why you go to Morton's or Fleming's.  The sauce was oyster mushrooms and some cream...too rich for me but so is filet mignon.  I also need a bit more bite in my mushroom so the oysters wouldn't be my choice.  It was served with a steamed chard which is not my choice either.  More support for why the pasta was damn good.  The bread was ciabatta leaning on the sour side so I was way into.  \nOur server liked everything, recommended it all and had trouble picking a favorite...AHHH don't believe you!  We like what we like and we can't like it all.  I'm asking for direction...help me out.  She was nice and present but not over the top.  Hope it wasn't the price point.  Overall, atmosphere, experience and most of the food was GREAT.","2959":"Jane's menu is diverse with something for almost everyone. I've been a few times with friends, or on dates, and every-time I leave talking about how great the meal was.","2960":"This little restaurant on state street is really cute. It seems like the perfect mid-week date night location. \n\nI was there on business and my co worker and I decided to give it a try. Food  was delicious. I ordered the Chicken piccata with fettuccini and vegetables and it was delicious. I will say, the chicken was a little on the salty side. Like borderline very flavorful\/very salty so i didn't finish it all. \n\nThe red sangria was so delicious! It wasn't bitter or too strong like in some places. It was just right. \n\nThe waitstaff was very nice. The manager came to check on us a few times. Unfortunately I went through a lot of water because of the salty chicken and it was hard to get the waiter to come over and provide more water. I found myself looking around for him. \n\nThese reviews were not kidding. That coconut cake is so delicious! I wish I would have taken some back with me.\n\nOverall great food and mostly good service. I will definitely consider coming back.","2961":"I was told to go here and order nothing but the classic cheeseburger with fries.\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nThe burger comes with provolone cheese, tomato, lettuce, red onion, Dijon mustard, and mayonnaise, and is served on a homemade sesame seed bun. All the burgers are 100% natural Angus ground chuck and cooked to order; in other words, delicious.\n\nMake sure to ask for some of that tasty chipotle ketchup to go with the fries; gives 'em a zing. Yum.\n\nDecent service, even on a crazy-busy night. I was impressed.","2962":"This restaurant was very mediocre. In fact, it should be called \"Plain Jane.\" I am not a foodie, nor a person who frequents restaurants a lot.  The ambience was nice, but we were seated next to two large tables of people, and it was difficult to hear each other. We each ordered a dinner salad which was the first disappointment. It consisted of four small leafs of lettuce, and two anemic tomato slices. For six dollars I was unhappy. Very stingy, I mean come on... How much does it cost for some more lettuce?? My fish was just okay. The sauce was lumpy lemon cream, which was way over-salted. The vegetables were greasy!!! it was supposed to be snow peas, and zucchini, I got one snow pea and a bunch of greasy zucchini.  Presentation was as bland as the food. My friend got some pasta, which was expensive, greasy, and over salted. She also was disappointed. She got a glass of wine which was delicious. The bread was tasteless. White bread which was just plain boring. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  I have had better meals at the local burrito joint.  I know better than to listen to hype about most things, but sucomed this time. Never again.","2963":"Yes, the coconut cake is as good as everyone says.  But, we also also enjoyed a great iceberg lettuce salad with bacon and a tender veal marsala.  The service was top notch and high fives to the staff who ran up and down the stairs to the second level.  Now that I think about it, I should have tipped you more.  Next time!   A delightful experience.  Thank you!","2964":"What an Amazingly Charming Restaurant!  Visited Jane this past weekend with a large group of people and everything that came out of the kitchen was absolutely amazing!!!\n\nMy favorites were the Onion Rings, Lamb Sausage Fettuccine and the Coconut Cake.  Best meal in town!\n\nI will definitely go back when I visit Santa Barbara.","2965":"A very solid date place in Santa Barbara. The food is great, and there is sufficient selection to please most palates. As mentioned in other reviews, the apple fritter and fried brie salad was outstanding. While the apple & brie are the stars, the salad and whatever dressing with it are sneakily amazing and would be worthwhile on their own. \n\nNot looking for a bottle of wine, we opted for individual glasses. It turned out of that one of the zinfandels they had was out, but the waiter was quick to suggest an alternative. Both choices were solid and the waiter was helpful in making the selection.\n\nFor entrees we had the chicken with anaheim chiles, where the \"extra\" bits overshadowed the chicken to a large extent.  The chiles with onions and cilantro had a stew like structure and had a vibrant flavor. We also had a pork special that had some fairly ordinary sauce mixed with bits of ginger. The sauce itself was unremarkable, but whenever I found a bit of ginger the dish sparkled magnificiently. If there had been a more uniform distribution of taste that would have been ideal, but as it turned out I'd eat it again without hesitation.\n\nIt turned out to be surprisingly inexpensive, given the vibe and that it's downtown Santa Barbara.  I would definitely go here again.","2966":"A total home run. Delicious from start to finish. Treat yourselves, your family and your friends to this wonderful dining experience. The food will not disappoint, the service will be fantastic and the bill at the end of it all will be completely affordable. Too bad we live in Los Angeles; I'd return tomorrow if it weren't for the long drive!!","2967":"Jane's closed on Sundays (too bad!!!), and we really wanted to try it out for a while. So we came up on a Saturday in SB with prior reservations for my husband's b-day dinner. I really recommend making reservations for this place; it was packed when we got there, everyone who was waiting for a table had a reservation. They seated us immediately. \n\nThe place is bigger that you might think. They seated us upstairs, facing State Street, which was nice. They had a Happy B-day! Card on the table for my husband that he wanted to keep, but they took it at the end for some other guest's b-day, oh well....We appreciated the gesture, anyway.\n\nWe weren't very original choosing our dishes; we checked their Yelp page and got \"the classics\". Since everyone praised their Firestone Red Rings, we got them for an appetizer. They surely were amazing, I'm not a huge fan of onion rings, but these ones melt in your mouth, the batter is great, the vinaigrette on top gives it a kick, the dipping sauce is addictive. The plate is huge, we thought we can't eat them all, but they're pretty light.\n\nFor the main dish I got Fettuccine with lamb sausage and I was about to go into a food coma. Normally, I wouldn't have gotten an appetizer, but had to try it here. The portions are big! Their pasta is so good, made with fresh ingredients, some of the best I ever had. Loved the tomatoes and fresh spinach they added on. The minced lamb has that great Mediterranean flavor, they really captured that so well. I couldn't finish it, but it was delicious. My husband had the Fettuccine with chicken, which was very tasty and flavorful as well; the sauce was really good.\nFor desert we shared their coconut cake, very good. As I said, we were copycats. Maybe next time we'll try other things. I would recommend their house sangria, although their wine list is extensive.\n\nService was good overall, our waiter kept forgetting to bring us their famous bread with butter from the house, but other than that, it was fine. It's not cheap, but the overall quality of the food and the ambiance, it's not bad.\nTheir web site could use more improvement, more info, a wine list. It's a bit too basic.\n\nCool atmosphere, cozy, great for dates, special occasions, perfect for small parties. Along with Opal is one of the best places on State Street.","2968":"We loved Jane! I had the seafood and vegetable stew and my sister had the chicken piccata. Both meals were delicious! The seafood stew had a light curry broth and was hearty with a variety of their daily fish. The chicken piccata was moist and flavorful. I would recommend either. Our server was friendly and helpful in suggesting meals we may like as well as wine. The restaurant closed at 10 that night so I was surprised to see the place was packed when we arrived at 9.  We were able to be seated right away. The restaurant had a chic mission style feel to it, very upbeat.","2969":"Thanks to the kind advice of a Santa Barbara local who we met at Hendry's Beach (must see for the sunset) we discovered Jane. The food was delicious and the service was extraordinary. (She advised us to order less as or eyes were bigger than our stomachs for all the delicious, yet rich appetizers.) We enjoyed it more thanks to her. We'd definitely go back!","2970":"Came here after seeing the cute place. Loved the atmosphere and the service. I had the chicken picatta was really good. It was so nicely breaded and the chicken was moist. The flavor was really good and tasty. Our server was really nice and offered good suggestions. I also had sangria with fruit which was yummy.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the coconut cake. It was delicious especially with the creme fraiche or whatever it was. It was absolutely so good!! I would definitely recommend this place.","2971":"My son lives in Santa Barbara and he knows how much I love coconut cake. So he asked me to come up for the weekend of my birthday to help me celebrate. He took me to Jane Restaurant. After our scrumptious meal, out came the coconut cake that they are known for with candles lit. Not only was I surprised, but after diving into the cake I was hooked. I don't know what they did to make it so amazing. I am tempted to see if they will send it out by mail! It has not even been a month and I still think about how yummy that cake was. Do you suppose I am addicted? For sure, when I come back up to visit...I think I will drive straight to the restaurant to pick up a whole coconut cake. Hopefully there will be some left for him to enjoy when he gets off work! Lol. Thank you Jane for the most scrumptious cake in the whole wide world.","2972":"Locally owned with a flair for the cozy, this is a great place to dine while you're out to the theater. Conveniently located next to the famed Arlington downtown, you can't go wrong and will leave feeling happy, perfectly satiated and eager to return.","2973":"Glad we were seated on the upstairs outdoor balcony, Jane is so noisy, but otherwise we enjoyed a basic 3 star dinner, good, not great. Caesar was run of the mill, Ahi and Duck mains quite good, lemon tart was the only real hero for me. Nothing wrong with Jane, just not a lot to recommend.","2974":"We had reservations for 2 on Wed evening. 8 pm. The two stars is due to the waiter's poor service. From the beginning, no warmth or no welcoming words. Every table had bread except for us. When the sous chef delivered our entree we asked her if we could have bread.  The waiter then delivered it & plunked it on our table with haughtiness.  All the candles were lit as people sat down, we had to ask for ours to be lit.  We had to ask for our water to be filled.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert. It reminded me of a serve yourself cafe--not a full service restaurant. His unprofessional & neglectful behavior made the food & ambiance less enjoyable. We are experienced restaurant goers & we left a 20% tip just so we could say we did our share correctly. We enjoyed our vacation in Santa Barbara.. Every restaurant & store had friendly wonderful service except for Jane.  It is amazing how important the server can be & make such a big difference.  I hope he learns to treat all customers with good service.","2975":"The food here, when it's good, is great. The service is, every now and then, not terrible. \n\nGenerally speaking, Jane is way overrated. The servers are not informed as to either the wine or their own menu. The kitchen is very uneven (sometimes the lamb meatballs come out raw in the center, other times burnt; sometimes the linguine is mushy, other time extra Al dente--food roulette!) and frustrating.\n\nBut, when you get a good service, it's very good. It's just not frequent enough to warrant the praise. I've also found the host (owner? Manager? Not sure) to be oddly rude and dismissive. SB service is not, as a rule, all that good, but still...when it's just plain bad, and I ask for some help, try not to make me feel bad for asking for a fork. Please.\n\nAnyway, the space is lovely and the ambience is great and I'm sure I'll be back at some point (I live here. Options are precious few.) Maybe it'll be a good experience next time; I love surprises.","2976":"My wife and I often order salads, so we've had thousands over the years. I can honestly say that the salad I had here just 2 days ago completely rocked my world. Never before have I had a dressing that was so light, refreshing, and perfectly paired to the selection of greens. My wife is a fairly accomplished amateur chef, so we're hoping she was able to divine the ingredients... we will be trying to make our own! This salad alone will ensure I eat here every time I return to Santa Barbara... but the service and the rest of the meal was also excellent. The only complaint I have is that the restaurant is (understandably) crowded, so you might have to wait (though our wait was only about 5 minutes).","2977":"Came here to surprise my brother and celebrate his 23rd birthday. The chicken piccata is impossibly delicious, as well as the rest of the food! The girl serving us was attentive and patient with all our requests, even the weird ones. We included her in a few of our rantings and jokes and she was very friendly and funny. Jane is located right in the middle of the downtown area on State street, so after our delicious meal we were walking distance from all the best representations of Santa Barbara's nightlife. Great place! Already planning our next trip!","2978":"It's official: I'm in love! I visited Jane in December 2010 for my birthday, and had an excellent time. To paint a picture for you...it was a rainy, cold night. It was a week before Christmas and State. st. was decorated....\nI walk in the front door of the restaurant and...\n\nI immediately feel comfortable. There are warm colors everywhere, people sharing tables, and great smells coming from all directions. We are swept to a table upstairs, and immediately look at the beer\/wine list. We order appetizers (some Red Rings and a brie and turnover thing, FANTASTIC) and enjoy a great winter ale they had on tap. I ordered the chicken picatta (hold the capers) and was in heaven. My friends had: duck, fillet Mignon, and the vegetarian pasta. We all sampled each others dinners and was impressed that each one were equally as tasty. The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and seemed to enjoy recommending certain dishes.\nThey brought out a piece of their famous coconut cake in celebration of my birthday which was really nice.\nI will go back in a heart beat (on or after payday). I highly recommend this restaurant.\n*Bonus points for having a separate vegetarian menu*","2979":"My fianc\u00e9 and I ate here last week, really great food and the service was excellent! We sat up top on their balcony, great view of State street. We had the calamari for starters, filet mignon, and chicken; the meal was great. I highly recommend dinner here if you are looking for a place to eat in downtown Santa Barbara.","2980":"Great dinner at Jane last night with my son! Prompt and friendly service and food was excellent. We both had the peppercorn steaks with the side dishes changed up. The fresh squash and scalloped potatoes were delicious as was his cheese stuffed chili pepper. Great end to our visit to Santa Barbara!","2981":"Today was my third and probably last time here. The place is cute and centrally located. The service is fine, although I wouldn't call it stellar. The food is just bland and boring and extremely overpriced. Today I had a $14 \"Chinese chicken salad\" that was a plate of butter lettuce drizzled with oil and rice vinegar and topped with three small chicken strips. It was bland and underwhelming in every way. You can get a Chinese chicken salad at the deli around the corner (I'm NOT MENTIONING NAMES and not affiliated with them in any way) that will blow your mind. It is four times the size of this one, and spicy and tasty and loaded with carrots and snap peas and daikon sprouts and cilantro and crunchy noodles and now I am starving for it, and not just because the one at Jane was so disappointing. There are just too many good restaurants in this town to settle for mediocre in my opinion.","2982":"Very cute atmosphere!  Had dinner here with my parents and boyfriend's parents. We sat at a long table near the fireplace.  I had the chicken fettucini alfredo and it was delicious!  Desserts were amazing, coconut cake was the best we've had.  I'll definitely go back to Jane!  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.","2983":"After battling 101 traffic on a hot sunny Saturday, Jane provided us with the oh so necessary foods and beverages to revive us when we arrived into Santa Barbara.\n\nEach of us tried a different salad bowl - all three certainly enjoyed the fresh ingredients, filling portions and hospitality of our waiter, Ben.  Afterwards, we couldn't resist trying the soft-serve ice cream sundae (complete with all 4 available toppings) and apple pound cake w creme anglaise.  Scooping a slice of cake plus the ice cream and toffee caramel was the perfect way to cap off our meal!\n\nWill definitely be returning on the next SB adventure, and looking forward to trying more of the menu. Thanks again, kitchen & staff at Jane!","2984":"The food was delicious.  We shared a coconut shrimp salad, which was ok - but a little too deep-fried for our liking and the shrimp had very little flavor without the curry dipping sauce.  We got the Jane burger (+lettuce + tomato), which was fabulous and packed with flavor.  The handout fries were also delicious.  Waitress was attentive and helpful.  Ordered the famous coconut cake for dessert (to go), and took it home with us.  We'd heard rave reviews.  The cake was just so-so for us.  Tasted a little like a glorified twinkie, which left us a feeling a little disappointed after all the hype.","2985":"Excellent value and great wine list. Only the most elite and cumudgeonly will have any complaint. Wait staff stay clear and don't rush you.","2986":"i want to give this place a higher review, but it's spotty (and sometimes lack of service) left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nthe food was delicious.  chicken picatta and sea bass were on point and deliciously seasoned.  the sangria was strong and cold, just how i like it. the coconut chiffon cake - definite 2 thumbs up.\n\nbut it's the service.  i expect faster and better service when i'm paying for an upscale restaurant.  i shouldn't be sitting with my party of 5 and notice that the other parties around us (a good 4-5 more tables) who were seated a long time before us, still have menus on their tables and are still waiting for drinks and food.  if their service was more efficient, then more stars their way.","2987":"Monday night and it was still pretty popular! Got to choose our seats and the waiter was quick and friendly! He was waiting at least 6 tables and still did a great job! The menu is slightly pricey but the food was delicious! We got the penne with bolognese and the chicken sandwich, and shared the lemon pot for dessert! The portions are smaller than typical for pasta but the quality of taste was incredible! We each got a white and red sangria, came in a wine glass and was sooo delicious! I can imagine this place being super busy on a weekend!","2988":"Loved this restaurant. \nVery friendly and efficient service. \nI had the lamb chops and my wife had the daily fish sandwich. My wife loved her sandwich and I thought the chops were as good as I've ever had. \nThe sundae for dessert was first rate.","2989":"This place was delicious! We got the red rings and fried brie apple salad to start and I got the chicken piccata after reading on here it was good, which it was!!!!!!! My husband got the fish n chips and I thought they were ok- the dill sauce was the best. I would recommend the chicken piccata though! oh and I agree with some posters the bread starter is not the best. For dessert we got the sundae which was very good. I thought the prices were very decent. We did not make reservations so we sat up on the balcony and it was very pleasant. The service was good as well. The only complaint is the older couple on the balcony- they were obviously having an affair with each other (they were talking loudly about it-ha!) shame on you people! I'm glad the chef forgot to not put the oysters in your dish that you so loudly complained about haha!","2990":"Vegetarian menu is limited, but beautifully done. We love to cook so I hesitated to get something that I felt we could do well at home, but the roasted eggplant entree was done with care: smoky and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, doused in a homemade red sauce. Also note that they do a portobello substitution for their sandwiches. And if you can, grab a seat on their adorable balcony, with a killer mountain view!","2991":"Jane, \n\nYou had me at apple fritter and fried brie salad, and you sealed the deal with that AMAZING coconut cake!  \n\nCalamari was good and the cocktail sauce and other dipping sauce were quite tasty.  Table outside on the balcony was a nice setting, and our server was friendly and attentive enough.  Hubby's shrimp in the pesto pasta entree was slightly undercooked for his taste; it's a texture thing, but the rest of the dish was pleasant.  My Chicken Picatta was wonderful, and did I mention the coconut cake?  Didn't actually have room for dessert, so we took the cake to go and shared it over coffee the next morning.  Wish I could start every morning that way!  Yeah, we'll be back next time we're in Santa Barbara.","2992":"Definitely in my SB top 3.... Awesome local place with fresh ingredients and a laid back atmosphere. Family owned and operated! Jane (well, her grand daughter and name sake) is often running the front and greeting guests. LOVE their chicken piccata and coconut cake!!!!","2993":"Jane is super cute, romantic and has a fun, locals vibe (I hate chain\/touristy feeling restaurants).  My boyfriend and I headed to Santa Barbara for a little weekend getaway, and I found this gem of a restaurant after Yelping around so we decided to give it a shot.  We brought our own bottle of champagne with us (which we weren't charged corkage for - not sure if that was an oversight or if they don't charge corkage), and were seated promptly after having made an 8pm reservation.  We were seated in the upstairs section of the restaurant, which was fully packed on this Saturday night.  \n\nWe ordered the fried brie and apple fritter appetizer at the recommendation of our server as an appetizer and it was super tasty! My guy had the skirt steak and he literally cleaned his plate and loved it.  I had the salmon on the cedar plank and was also impressed - it was cooked perfectly.  Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, but from the reviews sounds like their desserts are excellent.\n\nOverall, this place has a great ambiance - semi-romantic, semi-trendy - and the food was good enough to write home about.  Best yet, it was affordable and I love that they focus on local, sustainable ingredients when possible.  Because we brought our own drinks, our bill came in under $100 including tip.  \n\nMy only recommendation would be to call in advance to make reservations, as there isn't a lot of waiting room at the front of the house, and the bar was packed.  Enjoy!","2994":"Walked in the night before the 4th of July, and were seated within a couple of minutes upstairs, outside. We were seated in the corner, I would not have wanted to be the middle table as the server practically has to grind on you to walk past. Unless you're into that kind of thing. \n\nThe food was delicious - all of it. The bartender downstairs was extremely friendly, our waitress could have used a lesson on how not to look like you want to murder all of your customer however. \n\nAppetizer round - goat cheese pancake. Had no idea what to expect, but I will tell you this: when you add goat cheese to a normal pancake, top it with smoked salmon, caviar and Cr\u00e8me fraiche, it's amazing. \n\nNew Zealand lamb chops - I'm not a HUGE fan of lamb, but I trusted the yelp recommendations and expectations were exceeded. I want more of it. My girlfriend had the sole, also unique and delicious. \n\nWhy not? Let's get dessert. Played it safe with cheesecake - was very cream cheesy with a fantastic raspberry sauce, and guess what? I want more of it. \n\nNext time in SB - I'd hit this place up again.","2995":"Bottom Line; Cute little place, good food, great service\n\n     Since my wife and I had our son, we havent really had the chance to go out very much.  So we brought the kid and the folks working there were very nice and cleared us out a spot so we could have our stroller. \n     I ordered the duck plate and the wife had the fried brie sandwich (?) - I cant remember what it was called but I did get a chance to sample it and it was yummy. \n    The duck place was pretty good - I loved the sauce that accompanied it.\nThe service was very good and it always seemed like there was someone around to make sure everything was in order.\n\n    The only downside I would say are the prices.  Both of us had water to drink, no apps and our bill was about $50 which IMHO is  a bit steep for what we had.","2996":"This charming little restaurant is ideal for a pre-show dinner if you're going to the Granada Theater.  I don't normally order chicken when eating out because it's something we often eat at home, but with so many Yelp reviews praising the chicken piccata I decided on that for my meal.  It was delicious and will wind up being one of those meals I think about and want to eat again.  \n\nCharming atmosphere, friendly staff, good food and wine. An ideal place for a nice dinner date.  I was too full from the chicken piccata but hope to return for a slice of their coconut cake!","2997":"I opted for a small wedding, 38 people to be exact... I did not want a party, I wanted a small dinner after my ceremony at the SB courthouse (Mural room). I called so many restaurants and non had a variety of food to chose from or the ambiance I was looking for. When I found Jane I could not be more excited. They offer many food packages which vary in price So you WILL find something that works for you. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is friendly not to mention extremely helpful! Our wedding dinner was amazing, everyone raved about the steak, salmon, and pasta! AND our glasses were always full! Thank you for the great service!","2998":"My fiancee and I were up in SB for the day and were looking for a nice place for some good eats at a decent price.  This place fit the bill.  The restaurant is clean and airy, with a simple Spanish-style aesthetic.  The food is a fresh and creative take on diner food; simple, yet sophisticated.  \n\nThe red rings (onion rings) are some of the best I've ever had!  None of that crumbly breading stuff, these were bubbly and batter-dipped, drizzled in a balsamic glaze.  Needless to say, we finished the whole plate between us.  Sadly this left little room in our wee bellies for the enormous entrees.  \n\nI got El Macho Burger, featuring such fine fixings as avocado, chipotle mayo, grilled onions, jack cheese, and a pasilla chile.  It was succulent, MESSY, and had just the right amount of heat.\n\nMy betrothed got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fried brie and sauteed mushrooms.  Among other exclamations of joy, she said it was \"out of this world\".\n\nThe accompanying salads were delicious (we love butter lettuce) and the fries were decent.  The service was great.  They gave us our own pitcher of iced tea, so we could refill as we pleased, which I really appreciate, as I store the extra liquid in my hump.  \n\nOverall, it was a delicious experience, and I recommend going there if you're in SB, if only for the greatest onion rings you'll ever have.","2999":"My husband and I came here on a getaway weekend for lunch. We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday. The restaurant had just opened for the day, and there were only a few customers. Since it was empty, the host asked whether we would like to sit upstairs outside or not. Since it was a nice day, we would love to sit outside. \n\nI am very glad that we did. It was amazing! It was a cute balcony with a great street view. I can imagine that can be very romantic at night. The restaurant is nicely decor. The wood tables, floor, stairs give the place a very homey feeling. \n\nNow, let's get back to the food. My husband and I shared the FIRESTONE RED RINGS. These were some pretty damn good onion rings. The batter was incredibly light and crispy. The onions were sweet and big. I like the balsamic topping which brought out some extra sweetness. \n\nMy husband got the EL MACHO BURGER. It was very tasty. The chile wasn't spicy at all, but it brought smokiness to the burger. The burger was big. It was a great burger. \n\nI love lamb, so I got the FETTUCCINI WITH GRILLED LAMB SAUSAGE. Hmmmm.... Delicious lamb! The sausages were bouncy and juicy. They were packed with flavors. The pasta was al dente and creamy. And, I love the tomatoes because they were so refreshing in the pasta. \n\nThe view and environment was great, and the food was even better. What a great start of our trip!!! I just wish I can finish all the food or take some home. We didn't order any dessert, because we were too full. We definitely will do that next time. I know that we will be coming back.","3000":"I have been fantasizing about going back to Jane for the past year. The decor and ambience drew me in. Our waitress was kind and helpful.\n\nBetween the perfect wine and food I was in heaven. \n\nThis place is absolutely perfect. A GREAT date spot.","3001":"Fantastic service (ask for Stephanie), and the most delicious food I've ever had in Santa Barbara. Completely fantastic-- highly, HIGHLY recommend.","3002":"My co-worker and I were up in SB for a conference and had the opportunity to try this restaurant.  My first impression was what a nice cozy layout with a casual feel.  The space isn't large but tables are spaced fairly apart.  The staff was warm and gracious.  The calamari was crisp and tasty but not oily.  The flatbread with the eggplant\/olive spread was really tasty.  I loved my chicken piccata.  I ordered Jane's sundae for dessert and it was heavenly.","3003":"I could have given it 5 stars if not for a couple points. \nWe made reservations and arrived on time. \nThe hostess stand was empty when we got there. No biggie, we wait. \nFinally hostess arrives and instead of seating us she takes a call of someone who was on hold to make a reservation. \nOnly after she completes that call does she seat us. Not best customer service. \n\nOur waitress was delightful \nThe food is fabulous. \nI had seafood stew with Thai influence which was absolutely amazing!!!","3004":"I contemplated between 3 and 4 stars. Hard.  But really, while most of the food was delicious - except the cold bread - overall it was a good, not great experience.  \n\nThe highlights:\n- very nice ambiance with two levels and balcony seating\n- the bartender was so nice and pleasant while we waited for our table\n- the goat cheese pancakes with salmon and caviar is divine! so delicious\n- our entrees were yummy as well.  the rack of lamb chops and the sole\n- both entrees were served with the same sides - au gratin potatoes and vegetable - just seems uninspired? Yes the au gratin potatoes were cheesy and delicious - but I could of made the same out of a box.  I want sides that compliment my protein. \n- seemed to have to wait unusually long time before we got our appetizer and after our appetizer seemed even longer to get our meal\n- our server seemed to be having a very bad day - she seemed upset so it made for a very tense, awkward exchange\n- the bread. As I mentioned above I asked for bread and what was served was hard and cold.  \n\nOverall, good restaurant with good food.","3005":"So I booked a reservation over the phone here about a week before my Dirty 30 celebration in Santa Barbara and the entire experience from start to finish was pleasant. When I called it was actually a few minutes before they opened for dinner at 5:30p so the woman on the phone kindly took down my number and said she would call me back as soon as she finished opening up. She called about 10 minutes later and I was able to book a reservation.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated promptly in their upstairs area, and the hostess even gave me a paper Happy Birthday sign to place at the table. The restaurant is small, much like many restaurants around here, but they were able to accomodate quite a few parties just the same. I especially liked the globe lights that were strung on the ceiling, it gave everything a nice warm glow. The fresh flowers on the tables were a nice touch as well.\n\nOur waiter was awesome and very attentive. There was never a time where I needed something and he wasn't there. He was even a good sport when my table got a little rowdy after a few glasses of wine..now that's a waiter ;D.\n\nMy absolute favorite entrees of the night would have to be the filet mignon with scalloped potatoes and the lamp chops. I had the filet mignon medium rare and they had it just right, not overcooked like a surprising number of restaurants I try. The scalloped potatoes deserve a mention of their own because they were absolutely amazing..I loved the creamy sauce that was draped over the potatoes. The lamp had a wonderful flavor and I would definitely recommend getting 3 chops, not 2..but that's just me haha. Be sure to also save room for some coconut cake. Hopefully you aren't one of the unlucky few that come if they run out! Don't like coconut you say? Yeah uh-huh me neither, order the damn cake..you'll thank me ^_^. The cake was moist and light, not overly sweet, and had a wonderful coconut flavor that isn't overpowering.\n\nBottom line, I would absolutely come back again. The entire meal was a delight!","3006":"Let's get this out of the way. Minus one star because we were seated at a table directly under the AC (which was great because it was a very hot day) that started dripping directly onto the table at my seat. The water splashed in my drink, on my plate, on my bread. When we complained it seemed really difficult for the waitstaff to decide what to do about the situation. Our group suggested we just move the table 2 feet forward and the drip would just land on the floor behind us. However I was surprised that after seeing where the water had fallen I was NOT offered a fresh place setting or a new drink. Weird.\nAnyways the place is white table cloth cute and it's located on State Street. It's absolutely charming and the food was excellent. Everyone left the table with clean plates and it's not because the portions were not generous. They were! Highly recommend the Cedar Plank Salmon and the Steak. Delicious white sangria was crisp and just the right amount of sweet.","3007":"My boyfriend took me here for date night! It was such a romantic place. The was waiter was also superr nice and attentive.\n\nWe started with the smoked salmon on a potato cake. UGHH SO DELICIOUS. I know it sounds so simple but how do you cook the potato so welll!!!??\nI got the grilled duck breast, and OMG it was so juicy. Usually duck doesn't have much meat, but dude this was packing. The sauce was also pure heaven.\nMy boyfriend got the veal and it was also SO JUICY and tender.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricier side but it's so worth it. I mean it has everything: good service, good food, good vibes!","3008":"Wonderful local fare.  I would highly recommend the dinner salads -- I had the papaya and Dungeness crab salad.  Filling, refreshing and bright.  Service also excellent.","3009":"The chicken fettuccine pasta bowl was very good, service was very prompt. Came here on my lunch, I only get 1 hour so I tested them on long was it would take them. Needless to they passed with flying colors. Food was out in about 7 minutes.   Also got a lemonade. And that was tasty. Tart and not too sweet. Only reason I deducted a star is because when I was more than halfway done with my meal, the hostess offers a bread basket. Dang it. I love bread baskets. Had it been served as I sat down Or as my food came I would not have been sad. This place is a few blocks down from work so I decided to try it. Will I be back? Eh it's possible. For about $19 a person for lunch is a little ehhh... We'll see.","3010":"Wow!  Fabulous dinner this evening.  Everything was home-made, delicious, and reasonably priced:  mushroom soup, ceviche, eggplant pate & olive tapenade with grilled flat bread to die for; seared ahi and broiled prawns entree salad bowl, chicken piccata, mussels.  Great atmosphere, superb service (thanks to Stephanie), and our best meal in SB this trip.  Don't miss it!","3011":"So happy I chose Jane for our anniversary dinner! It wasn't too frou frou or over the top, and the food was top notch. We requested to sit on the balcony which is pretty small but totally cute - and they accommodated. \nWe had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer. They skimped a little on the shrimp (3 medium size) but it was crunchy and delish - served atop a bed of water cress dressed in a sweet (slightly tangy) sauce. I wasn't crazy about the curry dipping sauce but the mango gave it a refreshing bite.\nBF had the lamb as per usual and said the flavors were very good. \nMy duck was phenom! Cooked to a tender, juicy perfection with the bold and sweet citrus\/port reduction complementing the (mildly) gamy duck - super yum. And seriously, the scalloped potatoes are amazingly buttery - I loved every bite. The side of veggies were just ok - lacking in flavor but it also could be that the potatoes out-shined it.\nOur waitress was such a sweetheart and gave us just enough space. I can't wait to come back here to try other dishes.","3012":"Jane is plain Jane done well. \nLocation and food is very good. \nLunch is reasonable and very tasty. \nThere is care and thoughtfulness in  the menu. Pretty normal American fare fancied up a bit without being too fussy. \nSwift service. Sweetly decorated, sparse but not too cool.  \nThere is a nice big long country style table, great for a big group. And then there are a few small tables upstairs on  outside little porches.  So charming and  romantic! \nI think  Jane is one  of SB's best spots.","3013":"I just can't bring myself to give Jane 5 stars.\n\n1st) their wine glasses. Sorry, but serving good wine in crap glasses is something for mediocre Italian restaurants to pull. \n\nyour wine should be served with just as much care as your food. sending out wine in a joker glass is just that, a JOKE. buy some real wine glasses, or don't sell wine worth drinking.\n\n2nd) the food was solid. the food didn't blow my mind by any means, but it didn't disappoint in any way either.\n\nFix the wine glass problem, and I'd probably go back. Don't fix the wine glass problem, and I'd rather hit up an equal or better restaurant where they use glassware that actually helps bring out the full flavors of their wines.\n\nI was led to believe that Jane was a bit more fine-dining that what we experience. Not that it's a bad thing to not be \"fine-dining\" - but I think our expectations were a bit high going in.","3014":"I absolutely love this place, great food and service. There has been a long streak of birthday dinners from here for me. My favorite dish is the steak medium-rare and it's as good as it gets. Mashed potatoes are an amazing side too. I just enjoy the atmosphere in there, and big group friendly.","3015":"Went here strictly on reviews...easily 4.5 stars and can't wait to go back.\n\nThe menu is short but really has alot of diversity.\n\nWaiter was overly helpful, friendly and attentive.\n\nCalamari was good, sauces pretty spicy for some, but I thought they were really good.\n\nBetween the 4 of us we had clams\/pasta ( with clams in the shells), papaya\/crab salad, fish and chips and I had grilled chicken. Love to come back to try the lamb or duck. Anyway the person who got the fish said it was alittle wet. I think it was all great.\n\nThe place itself has great ambiance, high ceilings and big beams.\n\nWould go back.","3016":"The food, ambiance, and service was excellent! We were greeted by a friendly hostess that took me and my mom to a cozy table underneath a string of lights that gave the feel of eating in an outdoor courtyard. We ordered a scallop appetizer (recommended by our server)that came served atop a beautiful scallop shell. The scallops were seared to perfection with spinach and bacon. For an entree I had the salmon cooked on a plank that gives it a subtle smoky flavor and topped with sweet mango. Yum! My mom had a steak salad bowl which she enjoyed to the fullest as well. For dessert we had the \"Jane Sundae\" and some coffee. The Jane Sundae never disappoints and the coffee you could tell was fresh! Our server,Shane, gave us just the right amount of attention which made our overall experience very pleasurable. My mom and I had a lovely time and will definitely be coming back. Next time bringing friends and family to share the love.","3017":"If you love being ripped off for bourgie food with no substance and tiny portions, then Jane is the place for you! I admit the ambiance is quite adorable, but that does not give you license to rip off your customers. I had the 2 tiny lamb chops which came with a tasty tomato feta sauce, but the sides of 10 tiny slices of under seasoned and dry scalloped potatoes along with 4 stems of broccoli rabe left me less than impressed. All this for $27? You've got to be kidding me. Another thing-red onion rings are so over-rated. They were heavy, greasy, under seasoned, and the vinegar glaze made my cheeks cramp. \n\nMoreover, I'm pretty sure that the wait staff forgot to give us free bread and instead focused on some middle aged ladies seated behind us. I suspect latent racial bias. They were sweet overall, but it takes more than smiles to win over customers. If you're in downtown SB, I'd pass on this joint.","3018":"I am struggling to figure out why people are giving this restaurant 4-1\/2 stars. Went this evening. The chicken piccata was over-cooked and, thus, hard. The fettuccine noodles were overcooked and, thus, gummy. My husband's sole was dry (lacked moisture), but to be fair, he still liked it. The calamari appetizer was good, but there was a piece of cartilage in it so big, I thought there was a part of a plastic package inside. (They smartly whisked it away before I could take a photo of it.) The calamari itself was very tasty, though. My 8 year old son liked his hamburger and fries. I  would have ordered dessert, but since I felt the meal was a 3-star, I didn't want to take a chance on dessert. Oh...and note, before you and those in your party start sucking  down your lemonade refills, I'll let you know, because your server won't, that they are not free.","3019":"Food good, service excellent, ambience lovely. Generally, a nice night out. Great desserts as well. Note: they serve only wine & beer.","3020":"This is probably one of the best restaurants in Goleta. I know that might not be saying much, but the point is, this restaurant is good. They have good flavors, portions, prices, fresh ingredients and good service. The cake is also a must try if you are there.","3021":"This was a great dining experience. Friendly staff. No wait (with reservations), and they were very accommodating when we asked to be moved to an open table closer to the windows. We shared 3 appetizers- goat cheese pancakes with salmon, cheese stuffed chiles, and fried brie and apple fritters. All very delicious. \n\nFor the main course our table shared osso bucco with fettechini and a plate of snapper. Also both delicious. 3 bottles of wine and we still left with a very comfortable bill. \n\nThis is definitely on my list of places to come back.","3022":"One word AMAZING!  Staff and Food so good What a Great dinner we will be back.  The food was hot and fresh we had a party of 7 our waitress was laid back and she did not rush us. It was a 10 star.","3023":"The food at Jane is excellent and the ambience is warm and inviting. Our server was accommodating and very nice.","3024":"Jane will always have a special place in my heart. Of all the restaurants I have been to, Jane has the most adorable atmosphere. There's a nice fireplace upstairs, wooden tables, and general homey decor. The wait staff are also very kind and make you feel comfortable.\n\nNow onto the food. We ordered the red rings for starters, which had tangy\/sweet balsamic drizzled on it. Note that the portions are quite large, so be prepared to split with a few people! My boyfriend and I wanted to save space for the actual entrees so we didn't end up finishing the whole order.\n\nFor entrees I got the filet mignon with scalloped potatoes, which had a yummy homemade flavor to it. My boyfriend got the lamb sausage alfredo dish, and really enjoyed it. It's basically the best comfort food and delicious carb overload! I had the leftover pasta reheated for lunch the next day and it was just as good. :')\n\nFinally, we ordered the coconut cake for dessert, and it was fantastic. I felt like I was eating a cloud! My boyfriend doesn't even like coconut, but he wanted seconds. Oh, and I thought they'd have some sort of dessert coffee menu but they didn't, so I ended up getting a $3.50 cup of burnt coffee probably from the morning batch. Bleh. I'll forgive them though because they are great overall and I would definitely come back here for another dinner date!","3025":"We were pleasantly surprised with our entire experience.  Nice vibe and the food and service was great.  We had the chicken piccata and I would recommend it.","3026":"Had dinner at Jane tonight.  We had an outstanding dining experience.  The staff was very attentive and the food excellent.","3027":"Jane was amazing. The perfect place for a nice dinner in Santa Barbara. A friend reconnected it to us, and we couldn't have been more pleased. We ordered clams for an appetizer, and my sweetie and I both ordered entrees off the specials menu--I ordered the lamb and he got the halibut. We were too full for dessert, which was disappointing because other reviewers said the coconut cake is great. We will have to go back for dessert and to try other entrees, too!","3028":"I had a fabulous salad for lunch here three weeks ago. The smoked salmon was light and delicious. The grilled shrimp was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy and sweet. Nothing worse than overcooked shrimp.The watercress was such a nice departure from your usual mixed greens and the dressing was creamy yet light and not overpowering. Wish I lived closer to try this again as well as other items from their menu.","3029":"Loved Jane so much on Wednesday night, that we went back for lunch on Thursday, our last day in SB.  Our waiter, Johnny, was excellent as was our meal.  Definitely at the top of the SB eating experiences!","3030":"Had a wonderful dinner, everyone in the party was thrilled with their order.  In particular, the chicken piccata and filet minon were fabulous!","3031":"Nobody minds having what is too good for them -- Jane Austen\n\nA man has every season while a woman only has the right to spring -- Jane Fonda\n\nFirst, have to disagree with Jane Fonda....as a man who himself is in the late summer of his life, women (and maybe most people) only become interesting in the late Spring or Summer of their lives.  \n\nRegarding Jane Austen's quote, I was just having a conversation with Yelp friend Chanel about the requirements of pampering oneself, along with helping others.  I think both skills are requirements.  So it was that I found myself in Santa Barbara pursuing a business opportunity that I decided to treat myself to lunch at popular local restaurant Jane.\n\nThe restaurant is owned by the family behind the Montecito Cafe and it is clear that experienced restaurateurs are manning the ship.  From the friendly and efficient service, to the warm and cozy interior filled with photos of the restaurant namesake, dark wood furniture and even a balcony with seating; there has been a great deal of thought put into the operation of this spot.  The menu has a little bit of everything for everyone (sandwiches, burgers, entree plates, salads, etc.) and possesses a smartly chose wine list (a local favorite of mine, Tangent, had their Albarino highlighted as wine of the day).  \n\nNormally I don't go for a gourmet burger...not when I can create a better one myself...but the Turkey Burger with Gouda was a highlighted special and I ordered that with seasoned fries and a starter of clam chowder.\n\nThe chowder was an excellent rendition...full of chunky, delectable clams with a sauce that bordered the too salty line but did not cross it.\n\nThe Turkey Burger was outstanding!  Easily the best version I ever had...turkey was moist and juicy and the Gouda with fresh tomatoes and lettuce accompanied it perfectly.  Wow!  The fries were great too!\n\nI polished off this outstanding lunch with homemade soft serve ice cream and chocolate sauce. The bill of course came with sticker shock of course!  Even for SB it was way overpriced.\n\nBut I enjoyed the meal...my server was pleasant and friendly...the surrounding were beautiful...a pampered lunch indeed.  Afterwards I worked off the meal with a hike (and I may be working off the cost by eating Toast all week).  \n\nHighly recommended especially if someone else pays :)","3032":"Love Jane's.  Food and staff are the best.  My only complaint is that it's really busy (because it's so good) and it gets pretty noisy.  Great place for a fun date.  Although they may have out-of-the-way tables that I haven't seen, it's not such a great spot for a quiet, romantic experience,","3033":"This was an amazing meal- good, fresh food and the best service we had in town over a 4-day stay","3034":"Excellent food here.   We got two different salads here for entrees.  I had on with lamb sausage which may have been one of the best salads I've ever had.   We also got the eggplant p\u00e2t\u00e9 which was great too.   Price was completely reasonable and service was top notch.","3035":"Not bad at all. Charming. Good food but not exceptional. We ordered apple fritter salad- not enough apples. Coconut shrimp -good. Chix fettucine was a crowd pleaser but when is it not? Duck not bad, burger very good. Fish sandwich not good. Pound cake and coconut cake pretty damn tasty. Service was friendly but slow.","3036":"My wife and I went here on a Thursday night for her birthday.  We were visiting Santa Barbara and after reading the Yelp reviews there was no question in my mind that this was the place to go.  We had 6:00 reservations but were hungry so we arrived a little bit before they opened at 5:30 and there were already people waiting at the door to go in.\n\nEverything about our meal was superb. We were greeted and shown to our table (upstairs, right on the edge overlooking the 1st floor - what a lovely room) right away. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food: we split an order of the Red Rings and shared a Caesar Salad. My wife had the Veal Marsala and I ordered Skirt Steak. Everything was excellent. \n\nMy wife hadn't looked at the menu closely. Many Yelpers had highly recommended the Red Rings so I suggested we order that. She said fine. When they brought them to the table she inspected them and said, \"these don't look like wings.\"   I told her, these are \"rings,\" not \"wings,\" haha. She was expecting something like buffalo wings. Anyway, this was much better - really light, crispy batter and deliciously oniony with a tasty dipping sauce.\n\nThe vegetables accompanying the entrees were wonderful as were the entrees themselves.  We were too full for dessert.  \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't hesitate recommending Jane to anyone. We both enjoyed our meal immensely - the food, service, atmosphere, decor, etc. all great.  There is only one small negative - my glass of white wine was too cold, but then a lot of people like their wine really cold so I can't blame them for serving it that way. Otherwise this was the perfect meal, and at a very reasonable price, too.  Next time we are up that way, we would love to go back.","3037":"Very good food. I had an excellent salad and swordfish sandwich. A bit odd that my sandwich bread was square, like from a Trade Joe's loaf, but the taste was great. Pricing is in line with an upscale ambiance, but not ridiculous.  Our server was just OK... a little too obvious that he was miffed that we did not order drinks. My one complaint - though minor - is that pricing on the menu out on the street is different from the table menus. My salad and sandwich were each $1 more than what I read outside.","3038":"We studied Yelp from our hotel and found Jane. The menu clinched it. Our first visit. Parking was easier than expected with a short walk from side streets. We wre seated right away - not crowded on Tuesday evening, but several groups there. We knew what we wanted and ordered right away, anticipating the much-recommended house baked bread. Water, a generous glass of wine, and the bread arrived promptly - but wait a minute, the bread was horrible! We speculated on this until our red onion rings came, which were absolutely delicious (although a little tempura-style oily) with a great dipping sauce. Continued to wonder about the bread. It was heavy, tough, with a pure white colored \"crust\" and tasted sort of raw.\n\nMy duck breast came done just right pink, a full breast, sliced, with a wonderful reduction, a skimpy scoop of very good scalloped poatoes, and perfectly done green beans with snap peas. Others had the grilled chicken and brie sandwich, possibly the best interpretation of grilled cheese you will ever find, on really first class soudough. The French fries were.. well, French! Tasty, crispy and soft inside, keeping their texture even when cold. We split two slices of coconut cake three ways and it was plenty. Everything but the bread was darn near perfect. Prices are reasonable for this quality. Service was attentive, courteous and prompt.\n\nGoing home we figured out the bread mystery. These rolls are undoubtedly supposed to be finished by 'someone\" when served, probably par-baked in the morning. Could there have been a miscommunication between chef and wait-staff as to who \"someone\" is? If we'd thought faster when served we could have just asked for a few minutes in the convection oven. Except for the awful half-baked bread, this would be a solid five star review. We will try again!","3039":"Excellent friendly service, very complete menu, great local wines and delicious food. Awesome mushroom soup!","3040":"Food was ok and so was the service,  but the reason I gave this restaurant a bad review was because they gave our birthday girl a slice of pie for her birthday,  and then put it on our bill without telling us it would be charged.  It also filled out for us a \"20 percent\" gratuity, but charged this after adding tax, probably believing we wouldn't notice, so they're cashing in on not just already a hefty 20% tip, but also 20% of the sales tax. It's just not honest business.","3041":"Excellent service and excellent food.  From the Brie and Apple Fritter Salad - the duck with the blackberry ginger sauce- to the lemon tart and the coconut chiffon cake. Just fabulous!  Great waiter!  Definitely a place to eat when you are in Santa Barbara.","3042":"My last two visits to Jane were disappointing. The appetizers were very good , but the main course mediocre. The Veal Marsala was heavy and rather salty. Last night I chose the duck breast and it seemed almost boiled. I think they put the thin slices in the microwave and the result was\ntasteless. The cranberry mango sauce sounded wonderful, but was just cranberry and mango---   certainly not delicious. They are very busy now, but come fall when just the locals are here, will they be as busy?","3043":"Came here with a small group of friends for brunch\/lunch. I ordered the Jane's burger with fries. The burger was a generous size and tasted juicy and flavorful. I love the combination of Gouda cheese, caramelized onions & garlic Aioli. Super yummy. Their salads are also just as delicious. Everyone left with a happy tummy. The decor is chic & inviting. Service is attentive and friendly.","3044":"Probably the most \"solid\" American place in town. No frills, no bullshit, just good food done right. Great for lunch and dinner alike with a simple yet great menu.","3045":"Had dinner here and really glad we tried it. \n\nThe place is cozy and you feel like you are in someone's grandmother's home. \n\nThe menu has good choices.\n\nThe prices are very fair.\n\nThe service was excellent.\n\nThe coconut cake that we saw on other's tables was something we could not pass up. It was worth each and very calorie.","3046":"Had dessert and drinks here with my sister. I had the chocolate dessert which was thick, chocolatey and very filing. Sis had the coconut cake which was light, airy and creamy. Truly the winner of the evening. Sis had rose and I had the Justin Obtuse (can't go wrong with Justin anything). Not crowded on a Friday night, good enough as always!","3047":"Love love love. Everything was fresh and tasty! I got salmon, friend got a burger and bother were spectac. Can't go wrong here! Trust me!","3048":"Amazing!  Everything we ate was delish!\n\nWe started with:  clams, apple fritter and fried brie salad, eggplant pate salad (on the vegetarian menu), and fried red onion rings.  It was all great, but the rings and the eggplant pate were by far the best, so great!\n\nFor entrees, we had:  fish and chips (great), fresh fish grilled sandwich (great), greek salad with homemade lamb sausage (great), the vegetarian portobello mushroom plate (perfectly cooked), and the chicken piccata (which lived up to the hype, so delicious!)\n\nFor dessert, we had the sundae (which was great, with homemade toffee and soft serve vanilla) and the coconut cake.  \n\nThe service was very nice, they had a great wine selection from which we had a nice white, and the interior was really comfy and well decorated.  There are about 50 more things on the menu I want to try.  My only complaint is that they dont have a website!\n\nI would recommend reservations as it was pretty busy on Saturday night!","3049":"Restaurants like Jane are few and far between in Santa Barbara. For the past 4 years I've been going to Jane for the one of a kind 'El Macho Burger'. Never have I once left there disappointed or hungry. Service and management is all that you could ask for. **Neat tip: check out upstairs patio seating**","3050":"My husband and I had a lovely meal at Jane last night. We started with a salad each. My husband had a traditional Caesar and I had the Brie and Apple Fritter with maple dressing. Both salads were fresh and delicious. For our second course we had the Lamb Sausage Linguine. It was wonderful! The sausage was well-seasoned and unctuous. The pasta was perfectly al dente. Both were tossed with a mild cream sauce that was dotted with spinach, tomato, and roasted garlic cloves. This IS the dish you must try! We ended the meal with the famed Coconut Cake, which was served with a vanilla sauce. The cake is light and airy, but the coconut frosting and vanilla sauce packs a yummy flavor punch. The latter is reminiscent of melted homemade vanilla\nIce cream, like Dad used to make with the crank ice cream maker. Try Jane, you'll be full and happy! Food bliss.","3051":"Although I love their food, I find it difficult to believe they won't allow an outside birthday cake to be brought in not even for a cutting charge which we have done at the downtown location previously, this is a huge deal breaker for me! I will no longer patronize this restaurant. I have never ever come across this before.\n\n****Updated: Received a phone call today stating they have reviewed their policy and are now allowing desert to be brought in for a nominal fee. I will be happily returning to their restaurants!!","3052":"One of the best salads I've ever had. Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Salmon Salad! Thank you for the recommendation and great service Jennifer! This is a great local spot with great lunch options. Can't wait to go back for dinner!","3053":"I went there around 6pm and was seated right away even though I didn't have reservation. The waitresses were attentive and always checked on if there were anything else I needed\/wanted.\nNice, not so small-cute place. \n\nStart your dinner with Firestone Red Rings and Baby Iceberg Salad and end it with the heavenly Coconut Cake!\nYou won't regret, I promise! :)","3054":"LoVED. \nThe venue. Ambiance. Design layout of the restaurant. Loved that we sat at top with a view of the restaurant below. THe music. Every song is on my iPod. \n\nMushroom soup cup for appetizer. Affordable price. DELICIOUS. With bits of vegetable and not a cream\nBased soup I was expecting. Which was way better. \n\nLinguine with clams. Not overly clammy. Sauce savory clean. Extra parsley. I liked. Good portion plate. \n\nDessert: coconut cake. I'm not a coconut or cake person. But reading the recommendation we ordered it. Glad we did! It was light not overly sweet and that white sauce. YUM. \n\nPerfect date night place. Friday night we came in early at 5:30 no reservation but definitely was filling up. \n\nSpace for a private party upstairs. Beautiful layout setup for it. Would love to do one here.","3055":"Great place with an amazing atmosphere and even better food.  The only negative was that they wouldn't let us order an appetizer before we ordered our dinner..","3056":"Really like this place for a good meal out thats not too expensive. Perfect location is ur gunna check out a movie at the Arlington after which I usually do when I eat here w my gf. \n\nI pretty much get the same thing every time- I start with the crispy calamari and then for entree get the grilled chicken breast or the veal Marsala. \n\nMy gf loves their salad bowls. Her favorite is the seared ahi n broiled prawns. Good cocktails and nice wine list as well.","3057":"On a recent trip to Santa Barbara, to see Bob Dylan, we were told about Jane while tasting wine at the Wine Cask. We went at 5:30 right when they opened. Wonderful greeting and we were seated upstairs on the mezzanine. Our server was cute, polite and very accommodating. There were 4 of us and we had the chicken picotta, veal marsala, NY steak and I had the homemade lamb sausage and fettuccine. We all thought the portions were good and the price fair. The flavor profile on all of the dishes were very good. Our only problem was the food, especially my lamb sausage was to salty. It was salty across the board so I presume this is they way they intended it to be served. I also had the mussel salad which was phenomenal and the only thing that was not over seasoned.I will definitely be back,,,service was awesome and loved the energy and atmosphere of the restaurant.","3058":"The comment about love actually is spot on. This restaurant is so cute and straight out of a film. The food is exception. And so is the service. If you like good homemade food in a wonderful atmosphere this restaurant is for you. I came here with my family and it has really been a great experience - I thoroughly recommend it. Ps get the jane sundae!","3059":"Celebrated my wife's birthday with kids here and it was just outstanding. Had the tuna salad, sea bass, burger and chicken. Yummy!\nFried brie and apple to die for.\nAnd, OMG, dont' forget to have their coconut cake and sundae.\nThinking of going back tonight if we can get a table.","3060":"Came here for a girl's night out and everything was perfect!! The food was amazing, the service was great and there was even a cute little sign on our table.","3061":"I came here for lunch this past saturday with a couple friends. It was pretty late during their lunch service, and the place was empty. \n\nI got the steak samish w\/ fries, and my two companions got burgers w\/ fries. uhhh, the fries were soo overcooked and hard! my samish was ok, but had way too much mustard on it. i also thought it was supposed to have sauteed onions, but they were still pretty crisp. \n\nnobody ever refilled our drinks and our server was pretty non-existent. the one joy was when we said the fries were over-cooked, they did give us a free slice of choco cake.","3062":"We stepped through the door of Jane  at 2:20 this afternoon. The sign read that the restaurant is open for lunch until 2:30. We were \"greeted\" with this comment by a waitress with short hair. \"You barely made it. You can have that table if you order quickly.\" If Jane Restaurant feels its customers are a nuisance, then please be assured we will never bother you again.","3063":"Nice family owned restaurant in the heart of DT Santa Barbara.  We had late lunch here on a Saturday and waited a few minutes to get seated although there was an empty table near the front which we were eventaully seated at a few minutes later..why not just tell us to take that same - only available table rather than  have us standing at the entrance?  After being seated, it took awhile for the waiter to take our order, awhile to get our drinks, awhile to get some bread, awhile for our food with an apology that there had been a mix up in the kitchen on our Firestone Red Rings (aka Onion Rings).  The restaurant was full and the waitstaff appeared over stretched.  One Waitress, one Waiter, and Hostess\/Owner\/Waitress who probably should get one more front end helper for the weekends.  The Owner appeared a little overwhelmed as one table nearby had to order another dish as they ran out of their original order in the kitchen, she informed the table of the change and dropped a menu back on their table...dropped and not handed!  The Owner also grabbed sweetener off of our table before our lunch was complete without asking if we were done using the sweetener.  Simply not acceptable for a restaurant.  Our Waiter was very good, when we did see\/interact with him, the Waitress also appeared to be doing a fine job at the nearby tables but the Owner should think about her own interaction with the clientele...\n\nAdditionally, the food was coming out slowly from the kitchen as you could see other frustrated diners asking about their orders.  Maybe they need another helper in the kitchen also?\n\nAs for the food, we had the Firestone Red Rings which you gotta order...simply the best onion rings that I've had in awhile.  Two salads...Prawns & Smoked Salmon, Pappaya & Dungeness Crab....could have had a little more crab in the salad for the $19 price.  Salads were fresh with nice dressings.\n\nEasily a 4 to 5 star restaurant if they had a bit more help in the front and back.","3064":"This place is delicious! Such great food and really reasonable prices. The service has always been great! Perfect at lunch with a huge selection of creative salads. I want to try every one on the menu! Dinner choices are excellent and the wine is really reasonable. Coconut cake at the end is a must if you want to indulge!","3065":"After doing some shopping at State street, my husband and i wanted to eat a nice restaurant for our last night at Santa Barbara. There were many \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurants along State street but nothing tickled my taste buds.\n\nWe happen to see this restaurant and luckily they had a menu posted outside so I can see what they served. We decided to dine here because the restaurant looked cozy and it wasn't so busy.\n\nWe were seated right away and our waiter, Zack, greeted us fairly quickly. We ordered coconut shrimp for the appetizer and he also brought us a basket of bread. My husband isn't much of a bread eater, but I ate some. It was a bit hard, but I was thinking it was sourdough so it was expected.\n\nI didn't know what to eat on the menu (I'm an eater that orders the same thing all the time lol) so I asked for his suggestion. I was thinking between the skirt steak with madiera or the fillet mignon. He recommended both and said that the skirt steak was REALLY good. My husband wanted it also, but I thought maybe he can order the fillet mignon and we can at least have a taste of each dish. \n\nI was really pleased that Zack provided a great description of the dish and how the chef prepares it. He recommended the steak to be cooked medium well (which I normally don't do) but he said that if I were to order it well done, it will be too charred. I went with his recommendation and when we finally got our entree it was AMAZING!\n\nHonestly, this was THE best steak I've ever ate. The skirt steak was thinly sliced and the mashed potatoes were sliced as well. The mashed potatoes were not just scooped up and slapped on the plate. The presentation of the food was just simply amazing. You can tell that the chef takes pride in the food they serve here, from taste to presentation. And although I ordered my steak medium well, it seemed like it was well done. I didn't see pink anywhere in my steak.\n\nI tasted my husband's fillet mignon and that was amazing as well! I made myself eat slow to savor the flavor of my food. That's how amazing it was!\n\nFor desert we were looking between cheesecake and a chocolate cake. Zack recommended the chocolate cake for us. I was afraid that it would be too rich. When we got the cake, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a 3 layer cake (I think the top layer is vanilla, then 2 layers of chocolate - perhaps milk and dark)? He also told us to try the sauce that was also on the plate. Couldn't really make out what he said it was, but it kinda reminded me of white chocolate. \n\nEven though the restaurant is small, the ambiance is just beautiful. It's romantic and great to just even have a coffee and chit chat inside. It's a 2-story restaurant so you can even be seated on the 2nd level overlooking the 1st floor.\n\nOverall we had a great experience here. Even the greeter came up to us to chat about our experience and we felt really welcomed here. Thank you to Jane and also to our server Zack for a great dinner!!","3066":"My childhood bestie had her bachelorette weekend in Santa barbara so we chose Jane as the 'fancy dinner' restaurant. I'm not gonna lie, I had doubts about Jane when we first booked the place. I didn't think it was very fancy and I didn't think the food would be that amazing. I guess everywhere else I've eaten in Santa barbara has been more expensive than SF and just not as good. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Jane! Amongst the 6 of us we all ordered something different and all the food was superb! Here are some things I tried\n1. duck breast - duck can be a hit or miss in restaurants. Jane's take was great! So tender and juicy. The bride to be loved it. \n2. chicken piccata - this one was my dish. I loved it!\n3. scallop salad - really good. light and fresh for seafood lovers \n4. filet - I didn't try this one but the other girls said it was good. \n\nI probably wouldn't recommend the wine here. It definitely didn't match up to their food. \n\nThe ambience was cute. It did get a bit loud at times, but the restaurant is very clean and open. I guess everyone has their own definition of \"fancy\" but Jane didn't disappoint. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday -- in fact the table next to us were celebrating a little girl's birthday. I would say attire is definitely not as dressy as a fine dining restaurant, but it's not also your tshirt and jeans kind of place. Being dressed up didn't make us feel too out of place. \n\nThere is only one bathroom so make sure you plan ahead if you need to use it since I frequently saw a line =( They might want to consider adding another one. \n\nLastly, the prices were very reasonable! Entrees are all mostly under $20 and the bottle of wine we had was $38.","3067":"skirt steak is bomb. Salmon just ok.","3068":"I have eaten both a lunch and a dinner here at Jane, and each time I was really impressed with the attentive service, cool ambiance, helpful suggestions, friendly staff, and who can forget the delicious food?!\nHighly recommend: Firestone Red Rings (crispy onion rings drizzled with balsamic glaze and a wonderful ranch dipping sauce), The Gorgonzola Salad (similar to a Cobb salad), the Bowl of Steamed Clams (my husband said he could have ordered that for an entree and been happy!), and the Seared Ahi and Broiled Prawns salad bowl (huge prawns and perfectly seared ahi over a light salad).  Even the bread and butter that they bring out to the table is wonderful- bread is perfectly chewy and the butter is as fresh as it gets.\nAnd I hear that I need to return for the coconut cake.\nJane is a favorite in SB!","3069":"My boyfriend knows that the key to get on my good side is to take me to Jane. I have never left here unhappy or hungry. The menu is composed of delightful comfort food and the ambiance of the restaurant is incredibly charming. \n\nFirst, the food\/booze:\n- The appetizers are all a win.\n- Great wine selection.\n- My favorite on the menu is the chicken piccata, but the skirt steak is a very close second. They are both served with very fresh, local vegetables and an additional side. (Pasta for the piccata and the most delectable potatoes for the skirt steak). \n\nSecond, the service\/restaurant:\n- For such a small restaurant, they're incredibly good at seating you quickly. They DO take reservations in case you're not interested in waiting. \n- The service is top notch. There's a male server that works the lunch shift that is my absolute favorite, but I've never met anyone I haven't liked here.\n- The actual restaurant is freaking adorable. The furniture is assorted, which gives the restaurant a very collected, home-y vibe. Love it.\n- The prices are amazing by Santa Barbara standards. \n\nCome to Jane. You won't regret it.","3070":"Tomato basil soup, excellent hamburger, great glass of wine and the most awesome coconut cake ever!  Could not have been happier. Service was amazing! Definitely put it on your short list.","3071":"Amazing food, great staff, kinda small but very intimate and romantic. Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone!","3072":"Came here last week after my friends got married at the SB Courthouse. We had the whole upper room and the service was great. The wine kept flowing and this was lunch time on a Wednesday, so you know it was a good day!\n\nThey had a shortened menu for us to choose from and made sure to keep the us filled up with delicious bread and butter.\n\nI went with the trout salad and I was very happy with my decision! It was fresh, flavorful, and plenty.","3073":"The restaurant was fairly small but was able to fit a large number of customers. The furnishings and decorations were eclectic, providing a sense of down-to-earth comfort. With a staircase leading to an upper level dining area overlooking the main floor, it was interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was quite noisy, however, with a bar or lounge-type feel. This took away somewhat from the enjoyment. There also didn't seem to be enough servers. While our waitress provided adequate service, she was run off her feet. She alleviated the need to visit our table frequently by providing a large jug of water.\n\nThe meals weren't extraordinary. I enjoyed a tasty burger with hot peppers and spicy cheese and very tasty fries. The portion was quite substantial.","3074":"awesome food, awesome service, awesome atmosphere... cant ask for a better place to eat on any given night. its a very cool spot, and a great local spot as well.","3075":"First off, the food was excellent.  We had the brie and apple fritter salad, coconut shrimp and grilled pasilla chiles.  They were all excellent.  The main courses were duck, a burger, and the skirt steak. All were excellent.  The issue for us was the service.  Despite getting there at 5:30, it seemed like it took a long time for all of the food to come out.  The waitress was non-existent, at which point another waitress came to help out.  Our biggest complaint would come with the little note that comes on the kid's menu speaking of how much they love kids, but do not love the way they act (i.e. they expect that food not be thrown on the ground, remove children if they begin to cry--have they met a one year old before?).  Our children had no such issues, but somehow they managed to make us feel like our children were not really important, including bringing our kids' food 5 minutes after the adults had their food, and not providing any napkin\/silverware\/cup of water for our youngest.    \n\nI'd go again, as the food merits that.  I'd just leave my kids at home.  Despite their message of loving kids, I don't tend to believe it.","3076":"We stopped by for a light lunch and were happily surprised by a wonderful salad recommended by our waiter...shrimp and salmon salad.  The sauteed shrimp was fresh and flavorful, the cured salmon rich and buttery, the avocado wedges creamy, and the greens sweet and crunchy.  We also ordered the fish and chips, but that didn't quite measure up.  The batter was too thick and didn't cook through.","3077":"Amazing value. Outstanding food. \n\nStarting with fried Brie & apple fritters, mixed greens, pecans and maple syrup. \n\nOh and a bottle of jane's pick - 2009 cortijo tempranillo & garnacha blend.\n\nShared the fish and chips and couldn't pass up the coconut cake again...\n\nLove this place.....","3078":"Holy smokes, what an incredible place. I dropped in on a whim for lunch and am I glad I decided to skip Ca'Dario that day (although I love Ca-Dario...that will come in another review).\n\nWith some welcome input from my bubbly server, I went for the frequently mentioned Chicken piccata with a Belle Glos Pinot. The plate arrived steaming hot, something I miss in many restaurants. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender with the lightest crunch on the outside. The dauphinoise was a great accompaniment, also well balanced in terms of tanginess and creaminess (although maybe a bit too heavy with the fresh herb). I'm surprised to say that the summer squash veg was, in some ways, the best part, if not because that portion of a plate is normally such a throwaway. Here it was piping hot, well seasoned, and al-dente.\n\nWhen the coconut cake arrived, I thought I would need a box to take it home because it was so big. Once I started eating it, I quickly realized that wouldn't be necessary.","3079":"Really lovely restaurant. Rolled into Santa Barbara around 1:30 and were able to get a table within 5 minutes....by the fireplace.  Cozy atmosphere, wonderful service. I had the Idaho Trout salad bowl and it was delicious. I absolutely need to learn to make that at home. Simple perfection.  Frankly I don't recall what the rest of my family had (it's been two weeks now....never wait two weeks to write a review), but I do recall that everyone loved their meals and the whole experience. For sure will come back when in SB.","3080":"Went here on a Friday night and it wasn't over crowded. It is a really cute place with great food, decor and staff. I ordered the fettuccine chicken and it was perfectly seasoned, right amount of cream sauce, and generous portions of chicken. I also ordered the coconut shrimp and I wasn't very impressed with that (hence the 4 stars). The shrimp were small and for what you pay, you don't get the flavor and quantity you expect. I came with a large group and they were able to accommodate us AND they split the shared dishes between two people with no problem. I would highly recommend this place for ladies night, date night, and anything in between.","3081":"My boyfriend and I happened upon this cute little place on our trip to Santa Barbara. We giggled like schoolgirls, yes, my boyfriend giggled like a schoolgirl, when we were granted our request to sit at one of three tables on the second story patio overlooking state street. The food was incredible, service was perfect and we had such a wonderful and romantic time. Portions are large and prices reasonable. For those that complained about prices, come on peeps, you know you are not at Chilis. For an upper-scale restaurant, we felt the prices were acceptable. Go here. I keep having food fantasies of Jane.","3082":"As we waited for our table, I decided to use the little girl's room, which was, as it turns out, a single-stall unisex bathroom.  It was occupied, so I waited outside like a good girl.  Less than a minute later, a very bad boy in his 70s or 80s decided to do the same, but subtly, and possibly without realizing, cut right in front of me.  A waitress saw this injustice and interceded, remarking to him that she believed I had been waiting first.  This naughty octogenarian boy either did not hear or pretended not to hear her, and I made my way to a second bathroom upstairs.  There is really little purpose to this story other than to demonstrate that it is amusing to be cut by old people and that the waitress was solid in her advocacy of all that is right and good, but there you have it.\n\nThe service otherwise was not very good, as our party of four was seated upstairs and likely out of sight, but the restaurant was nice, and we had a lovely dinner.  The venue was very pretty, with lots of wood and hanging lights, and despite the slow service, I enjoyed our high perch.  I also appreciated that we were able to get a table without a reservation after a reasonable wait.\n\nThe food was quality, straightforward but well-executed.  I ordered the roasted butternut squash soup with slivered almond and the half papaya dungness crab with creamy curry dressing and butter lettuce.  The soup was on the thin side, but had great flavor.  It fared better when sopped with some good bread than it did on its own.  Jane's bread was very good - it tasted vaguely like onion bagel.  The salad was excellent, appropriately filling, with ripe sweet papaya and a generous portion of crab.  The curry dressing made it interesting without throwing anything out of balance.  I stole some of my boyfriend's roasted duck with port blueberry sauce and roasted vegetables and potatoes as well, and was impressed by the dish.  The potatoes were notably delicious, very deeply flavored and well seasoned.  The duck itself was good, and the sauce was well-conceived.  There were some chunks of very harsh ginger that should have been strained out, but the plump whole blueberries that stayed in were fantastic. \n\nFor dessert our table split a slice of coconut chiffon cake with creme anglaise and vanilla soft serve with apple fritters and caramel.  Both desserts were lip-smackingly good.  The chiffon cake was fluffy, tall, and light as air, anchored by the rich creme anglaise.  The soft serve was superb.  I really love a great soft serve, and this one came in a decadent sundae, with apple fritters that were just wonderful.\n\nIf I lived in Santa Barbara, I think I would eat here fairly often.  It's casual enough, and the food is almost as good as it gets at Jane's moderate price point.  I could even see it being a great place for weekend family dinners.  The service is not ideal, but it isn't bad either, and sometimes you meet funny old people.  I had a nice experience, and I'd recommend it to both locals and out-of-towners looking for a good, comfortable, reasonable meal.","3083":"This is a great place to hit up for dinner before a show at the Arlington! My girlfriend and I both ordered burgers and enjoyed the meal. The high quality beef was juicy and cooked to a nice medium. I had the seasoned fries which I don't see on the menus of other restaurants we frequent and it's a nice touch. 5 stars for the carafe of iced tea that was served along with the glass I ordered. For me that was a real treat since I drink more than one glass in a sitting!","3084":"Good things first. Quick seating and attentive service. OK wine-bottle list with good prices. Main dishes were yummy for all three of us. Now the not-so-good things. Weird wine-by-the-glass menu, as if they want to discourage this and order a bottle instead. Wine glasses were small and thick and very unappealing. Side dishes weren't very good--cold and bland scalloped potatoes and french fries. Drinking a nice bottle of wine in their unappealing glasses is what really knocked my rating down to 2 stars.","3085":"Serendipitous discovery as we were passing through SB. Puzzled by some of the unhappy reviews - our experience was 5-star. Calamari first-rate - crispy, hot, tangy. Seafood pasta smelled and tasted as if it had a good amount of seafood in it and indeed it did. Service was attentive and courteous. Coconut cake as noted in other reviews - don't miss it.","3086":"The best seafood stew of my nearly 67 years on this planet.  Don't miss this if you visit my town of Santa Barbara I was born here, have visited 50 countries and all but 4 states and this was the best fish stew I have ever had.  Tell them Howard sent you","3087":"mediocre yet pricey. the hostess or manager not sure which is so rude I watched her scold a table for having a video stream from their cell phone. it was terribly uncomfortable and it wasn't loud. it was a huge turn off.","3088":"I Love this place and every time I have friends from out of town I take them there. Their fish is always my favorite, however they have great salads as well. The best is the papaya crab salad.  Everything in the plate  has a great taste. All the staff is friendly and efficient. Great selection of wine and beer. It's one of my favorite restaurants in town and the price is very reasonable. Must try!!","3089":"Can't say enough about awesome this place is. We came here for a girls' night dinner and we were still talking about how amazing the food was the next day. Service was impeccable, the ambiance was adorable and the whole experience could not have been better!!","3090":"We found Jane on Yelp and we were not disappointed. This was a fantastic spot for lunch, the food was great, the staff friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere. They were very accommodating to my dietary needs. We definitely would go back if we were in town longer.","3091":"Every dish I've ever had here has been delicious. My fav is the chicken piccata. One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara, but their service could stand to be a little more welcoming.","3092":"Such an adorable restaurant with wonderful service and food. Had my first experience here not too long ago after hearing nothing but great things about the place. Definitely lived up to the hype. I loved seeing the host be attentive to all customers, not only as they were walking in but also at their tables throughout their dining experience to make sure they were enjoying everything. From this, I assume she is the manager and\/or owner. With this said, great service and delicious food. Will return!","3093":"My family and I went up to Santa Barbara for the weekend and decided to give this place a try since many of my friends came and there was remarkable reviews on yelp. I called around 7:30 to ask if I went in now how long the wait would be and the lady said there was many open tables and told us to just drop by. So we quickly arrived, but by 7:45, when we got there, it was packed with about 4 more parties standing before us. I went in to ask how long we would have to wait and the host did not seem welcoming at all. She seemed slightly annoyed, actually. She said the wait was about an hour or we could go somewhere else but we decided to stay. We were walking down State St. to check other stuff out because they said they would call and after 30 mins of walking, they call to tell us that they're ready for us. We were already on the other end of State St. so we rushed back because she said she had no guarantees to save the spot for us if we didnt get there soon. \n\nWhen I go there, the service was pretty decent. The bread was cold but we were so hungry, we scarfed the basket down in no time. The filet mignon was one of the better dishes. The NY Steak could be better. The Classic Burger, I highly recommend, because the fries that come with it is AMAZING. I've never had better actually! \n\nOverall, its a decent place to go. It wouldn't be my first choice but if you happen to walk by and it isn't too busy, its worth the try.","3094":"Absolutely delicious chicken piccata.  We also had the signature coconut cake.  It was very light and fluffy - tasted great!","3095":"Me and a friend visited here for dinner one weekend night. me, as an out-of-towner, her as a regular and resident of SB, who had eaten at Jane many many times.\nIt's been a while since we ate there but from what I recall the food was delicious, the waitress a bit inexperienced and the setting, very vibrant.\nWe had a little mis-hap with a bottle of wine we had brought with us, but were able to enjoy the wine, even though the staff member cracked the cork on a very expensive bottle of wine.\nI would definitely head back.","3096":"After reading previous reviews, we made sure to save room for the coconut cake. And we were so glad we did. \n\nFirst, the ambience was lovely, very cozy and warm. The service was excellent as well; our server was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and offered to bring me a taste of two different dessert wines I was thinking about. \n\nAnd then there was the food. The food was incredible. The flatbread appetizer was truly the best flatbread I'd ever had, and was served with a delicious tapenade and an eggplant 'p\u00e2t\u00e9.' The seafood stew I ordered was something really special, with lots of perfectly cooked clams, scallops, shrimp and fish, lots of fresh vegetables, and in a sauce that was incredible.\n\nThen, there was the coconut cake. The other reviewers are not lying. It was amazing, and did not disappoint in any way. \n\nThis restaurant will now be a regular stop for us here on State St. Such a great experience.","3097":"This place was awesome! I went there for dinner for a Bachelorette party. They were super accommodating, our server was fantastic, and the food..... AMAZING!!!!! A definite will go to again!!","3098":"I really like Jane for company dinners with teams of 10-ish (Company lunches are great too, due to the variety of entree salads.) I ask for upstairs because it's semi-private and quiet. We had a great team dinner last week and were very happy. The service is uniformly great - accommodating, available but not overly so. \n\nWe ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer for the table and we devoured it (note to the Chef, you could add more variety of non-seafood appetizers that would be easier for a group to pass and eat).\n\nI had the trout salad with dill dressing which was delicious and unique; will put that on my \"order again\" list (along with the linguine and claims). \n\nI had a spoon of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it had a super smooth custard with the perfect amount of tap-tap-tap on top!","3099":"Wonderful.  Best chicken piccata I've ever had.  Filet was great too.  Onion rings worth trying.  Great atmosphere.  Not cheap, but not too unreasonable.","3100":"The food was very tasty (I had a burger, friends had the Mahi Mahi and roast duck). The portions were satisfying. Cute setting, friendly service, wide selection of wine, but definitely on the pricey side.","3101":"Allt var helt fantastiskt!!!! Vi delade en tallrik friterade r\u00f6dl\u00f6ksringar, kunde inte varit mer perfekta till varmr\u00e4tt blev det en lax och en anka \u00e4ven detta helt gudomligt!!! Och kokost\u00e5rta till dessert som bara sm\u00e4lte i munnen!!!","3102":"Lunch at Jane is a quite and relaxing lunch with great food options.  The inside decor is cute with some seating available upstairs on both ends of the restaurant.  \n\nThe fried red onion rings were delicious!  They use large onions, so if you are not a big fan of the large union inside a ring, I'd get one of their other delicious alternatives like the brie and apples or delicious fries.  But those onion rings are so good not to try at least once - they are paired with this tangy sauce that enhances the flavor.  Just typing about them makes me crave some!  \n\nSuper friendly service, good food options (and their menu is consistently changing), with decently priced lunch specials.  I'd definitely recommend this place.","3103":"Went here on a Saturday night without reservations, and we were seated immediately upstairs on the patio, which was really nice. I guess that wasn't that great of a choice since the servers don't pass by too often, and they sort of forget about you sitting there. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a server to come by to ask for more water, or for parmesan cheese, or whatever it is that we needed. \n\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer to start. They brought out the calamari together with bread and butter. Wait, wasn't the bread and butter supposed to come out earlier, maybe with our drinks? Well, at least, that's how its been at every other place I've been to. The bread was warm and fresh though, and the calamari tasted great as well. But I did tend to find something in the calamari, not sure what it was though. It fell under my tooth and it was definitely not edible.   That sort of threw me off.\n\nI was debating whether to order pasta or the filet mignon, and I ended up ordering the Seafood Pasta, but told them to make it with the sauce of the Linguine & Clams. They had no problem in doing that for me. My girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon.\n\nThe clams in my pasta were not cleaned for sure. I had one, and I felt a rocky crunch under my teeth. I thought it might have been just that one, but after I tried a second one and felt the same, I did not even bother to touch the clams anymore. The White Wine Butter Sauce in the pasta wasn't that great itself. I am a HUGE fan of pasta. I know a pasta isn't good when I don't finish it, and that was the case here.\n\nI tried a piece of the filet mignon my girlfriend had ordered, together with the potato and the mushroom sauce, and it was honestly very good (making me regret ordering the pasta over the steak). I'm going to be honest, this place was going to get a 3 star review if it wasn't for the steak. If I ever go back here, I will for sure get the filet mignon, or try something different.","3104":"Had another wonderful evening at Jane! Everyone is always so warm and the service was excellent as usual. I highly recommend the duck; always delicious. The scalloped potatoes are simply divine. We always order extra! Jane is perfect for an easy night out or for a special occasion.","3105":"A really enjoyable meal.  As good as the food was the true standout was the high quality of service.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar for a bit before getting seated.  The manager took good care of us even as she was completing a number of other tasks.  We got seated out on the upstairs balcony, a very cool little spot to sit.\n\nOur waiter was excellent and friendly, just really high caliber and enjoyable.\n\nI got the lamb chops special which was delicious.  Our waiter did a good job of steering me towards the dish I wanted.  His recommendation was perfect.","3106":"Wir kamen auf das JANE durch ein anderes Bewertungsportal. \nDie Bedienung im Restaurant \n(f\u00fcr uns war ein junger Kellner zust\u00e4ndig, war sehr freundlich und \nzuvorkommend und hat uns direkt diverse Speisen empfohlen).\nZu Beginn bekamen wir etwas Baguette mit Butter sowie das obligatorische Glas Wasser.\nWir\n orderten 2 Bier, als Starter einen gemischten Salat mit Avocado, den \nwir uns teilten und als Hauptgericht den BBQ-Burger mit hausgemachten \nPommes-Frites und die Linguine mit Venusmuscheln in Wei\u00dfweinsauce. \nDas \nEssen war sehr, sehr lecker. Mit Espressi zahlten wir 67$ und war rundum\n zufrieden.\nDieses Restaurants k\u00f6nnen wir komplett weiterempfehlen.","3107":"Our trip to Jane was a top memory from our weekend trip to Santa Barbara.  The ambience, service, and food were all just perfect, delicious and personal.  The list of wines by the glass is impressive; we really enjoyed our choices.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough based on our experience.  The place is adorable (kind of like \"Mom's House\" but neat as a pin and somehow still contemporary), and the food (a seafood casserole with coconut milk and a pasta Bolognese) was off the charts in regards to quality, taste, portion size and presentation.  Elegant and fantastic.","3108":"We had gone through a stretch of some very average meals when we were looking for a nice spot for lunch before heading back up the California coast.  Enter YELP and the reviews of Jane.I suspect that the space is cooler in the evenings but for lunch, it was still just fine.  The food however, was simply outstanding.  I had the greek salad with lamb sausage. It was a combination that surprisingly works. The salad part, even with the dressing, was light, fresh and flavorful.  The lamb sausage patties were delicious. For some reason I had a taste for Scallops and had them served from one of their salads (without the salad part) and they were really good.\nAll in all, it is the perfect place for a delicious, unassuming lunch or dinner. Highly recommended whenever you find yourself in Santa Barbara.","3109":"Jane was actually pretty good ! Prices were pretty reasonable, not super high for Santa Barbara. Service was a little bit slow and it seemed like the waiters were a little rushed at times because they do a lot of running around, but the food was really good. I would go back","3110":"Jane is a quaint little restaurant in the heart of Santa Barbara. Being the sister restaurant to the Montecito Cafe, you'd expect Jane to be good. \n\nIt is. \n\nAt Jane, everything is priced well and the portions are more than enough to fill the bellies of most people. If you're coming here for the first time, try the fettuccine and Lamb. I guarantee you'll love it. \n\nThe service is prompt and friendly (the waitresses are cute, too) and they have freshly brewed iced tea. What more could you ask for?","3111":"Jane is our new favorite 'gal' in Santa Barbara.  Found accidently, it was a yummy surprise.  We arrived early enough to miss the crowd (I recommend being there early - the place really filled up!)\n\nWe split the coconut shrimp (pretty tasty), but the real treat was my delicious grilled chicken salad - HUGE serving (could be enough for two)...filled with bacon, avocado and cheese, it was lovely.\n\nMy husband had the pasta with lamb sausage (carbo loading before Santa Barbara marathon.)  Again, a very generous serving.  He really enjoyed it.  Lots of garlic (that lingered!)\n\nNice staff, warm decor and great location.  We recommend it highly!\n\nEnjoy!","3112":"Jane was amazing. The perfect place for a nice dinner in Santa Barbara. A friend recommended it to us, and we couldn't have been more pleased. We ordered clams for an appetizer, and my sweetie and I both ordered entrees off the specials menu--I ordered the lamb and he got the halibut. We were too full for dessert, which was disappointing because other reviewers said the coconut cake is great. We will have to go back for dessert and try other entrees, too!","3113":"We chose this restaurant to celebrate a birthday and they barely acknowledged our special day - they did print out a sign and put it on our table. It was actually a big birthday for us (and me who's birthday was just a few weeks ago)...and I drove all the way from San Francisco to meet my LA friends to celebrate as a group. Our server didn't wish us a happy birthday and we had to pay for our own dessert. This was the first birthday dinner where they did not get  a dessert, candle or something to make it special. I know it's not a big deal BUT if I'm celebrating a special occassion and drove over 5 hrs, these little things do count. I paid $40 without alcohol, so it wasn't a cheap dinner!","3114":"Came here for a girls' date night with my friend and we had an excellent time. We split everything, starting with the baby iceberg salad. It had good balance of lettuce, bacon, avocado, and bleu cheese dressing - no single ingredient seemed to overpower another. Next, we shared the flat iron grilled New York steak, which was a great decision. Cooked perfectly medium rare, the meat was tender and juicy and the accompanying sauce suited it well. Potatoes and snap peas on the side provided a good flavor balance. Not 21 yet, so we couldn't order any wine with the meal unfortunately. Ended with their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was a bit of a disappointment. I love sweets (perhaps a bit too much) so I enjoyed the dish anyways, but the top was not caramelized all over - still gooey in some areas near the edge - and the custard was just average. Could make much better at home. The only other unfortunate thing was the first waitress we encountered. When we first checked in for our reservation, which I'd made a week in advance, I could tell she was already making judgements based on our age. Yes, I may be a college student, but that doesn't mean you can make any generalizations about me. She immediately had an attitude towards us as if we didn't matter quite as much as guests. After she brought us to a table, we asked to be moved upstairs where it was quieter (since there was a large, loud party of about 20+ people downstairs). Our waitress in that seating area was excellent, and the rest of our night was very pleasant.","3115":"No exaggeration, top 3 best meals of my life. Get the chicken piccata, it's the best I've ever had. Staff was warm and friendly and the location is delightful. A must for any SB trip!","3116":"There are two things at Jane that you NEED to order...\n\n1. The Calamari\n2. Chicken Piccata \n\nEnjoy:)","3117":"I love Jane as a great date night restaurant, they have good food and a good atmosphere. Last summer we hosted our rehearsal dinner before our wedding here, and we loved that too! They seated us in their private upstairs dining area, and we all had a great time and everyone loved the food and the setting.","3118":"Great place for dinner , walk in and sit at the bar or make a reservation for a table \n\nVery friendly staff and good value","3119":"The food was very delicious (particularly the NY steak), the space is very pretty, and the service was amazing! We were traveling with a baby, and they were very accommodating. They brought out all our food very quickly at our request.","3120":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!  I've been here a few times now and am a raving fan!!!!  The staff is warm and friendly and know how to treat people right. My girlfriend and I were sat at a table by Jane and I have to tell you that she is a breath of fresh air!!!  Very nice and friendly and knew exactly what we should order based on our suggestions. Not only that she came to check on us multiple times and made us feel very welcome!  I ordered the flat iron grilled New York steak and it was sooooooo good!!!  I highly recommend it. My girlfriend ordered the fillet mignon and she was blown away by the amazing flavors. I will be a frequent customer!!!  Thank you Jane for your great food and service!!!","3121":"FOOD: Food was outstanding. My spouse and I shared a filet mignon and a chicken piccata. Both were delicious. Don't waste your precious stomach real estate on the bread they bring out. The entrees are worth the wait! We also shared the chocolate marquise dessert which was just rich enough to make us want to lick the plate clean!\n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very nice and gave us excellent suggestions. Unfortunately her manager clearly gave her too many tables that night. She was working her tail off though. At one point the host had to come up and help. \n\nAMBIANCE: Beautiful and charming. Hanging white lights and long tables for large groups makes for a very lively experience. We loved it!","3122":"Delightful lunch experience. Great choices, helpful wait staff, a  bright and airy room, and good food. Large nicely prepared spicy chicken salad. And the kids fish and chips looked great.  Don't think I'd order the pesto chicken sandwich again but I would definitely go back.","3123":"The ambiance was nice and gave a cozy Californian Spanish flava with dark woods, adobe colored walls with a distinct taste of Old Santa Barbara.  It was cute.\n\nThe food was good, but after a week ... not quite that memorable.  I had to think hard to recall the chicken w\/baked brie sandwich and mushroom soup I had. The baked brie was fantastic.  The mushroom soup was too oily and bland.  The macho burger and salmon sandwich was good, but average.  Our water glasses were always filled high but so were the prices.","3124":"Such a sweet place! Adorable, romantic and delicious. The chicken piccatta was amazing! Service was impeccable. Would definitely come back. It's a little gem.","3125":"What a menu! I could keep going back to this place for weeks and try something new each time. My favorites have been the Trout Salad and the Seafood Stew, both were fantastic.","3126":"On our way up to Northern CA we stopped for lunch in Santa Barbara at  Jane.  We dove into a heaping plate of Firestone Onion Rings.  Be warned:  This is not an appetizer for two, but a plate for a party of six or so.  We still managed to finish a good portion of these tasty delights.\n\nWe shared a wonderful Ahi and Shrimp salad with Sesame Dressing, which was superb.  Thankfully we left room for dessert.  Everything we had at Jane was really good.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful.  Decor is warm and welcoming.  Thanks Yelpers for helping us start out our road trip in a great way!","3127":"I took my friend to Jane for her birthday since I had heard raves about the coconut cake.  Our experience was phenomenal.  They were a little late on our reservation, but were super apologetic and since we weren't in any hurry, it wasn't a big deal to us.\n\nI started with the mixed greens salad with fried brie, apple fritters, and candied walnuts.  Wow.  Fantastic.  The salad was larger than I had expected, so I was able to share the delight with my friend.\n\nShe had a roasted vegetable sandwich with sun-dried tomato spread.  Delicious.  I had the rib-eye steak.  Fantastic.  We ended with a slice of the coconut cake in creme anglaise and a 3-layered chocolate mousse also with creme anglaise.  Both were great.\n\nJane provides 5-star food in an upscale, yet casual atmosphere.","3128":"We ate here for lunch and it was so good that we ate dinner here the same night.  What more do you need from a review than that.  Also very kid friendly.","3129":"I have a difficult time rating this restaurant. Some things were outstanding, some were not. \n\nI am traveling alone and have the bed and breakfast make reservations for me. I hear Santa Barbara restaurants can fill up fast. Unfortunately , they do not accept reservations for parties of 1. They tell me it shouldn't be a problem, though. \n\nI arrive and let the hostess know it will be just me for dinner. She asks if I have a reservation. After I explain that I tried to reserve a table, I'm shown to the bar. The bar is lovely with a lunch counter feel. There isn't a bartender back there. \n\nThe waitress was very polite and knowledgable about the menu. I ordered lemonade ($4.50) and Penne Pasta with Scallops, Shrimp, and Clams ($18)\n\nI had to ask for bread. I recommend the bread. Please do ask if it isn't brought to you. It's delicious. The meal was good, not great. The shrimp were ever so slightly over cooked. I still ate all three of them, but they had a slight rubbery consistency. The dish was very pretty and plentiful. The lemonade was perfectly balanced. Pricey, but very good. \n\nI give this place a  3 out of 5.  Do not ask lone diners if they made a reservation if you know you don't accept reservations for parties of 1. That is confusing and annoying. Also, every restaurant who serves shrimp should know how to cook them. \n\nI hear the burger is very good and the buns are made fresh. I will be here another week and may decide to try again, though the reservation situation may be too much of a hassle on busy nights.","3130":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere is perfect. It is a must stop in Santa Barbara . My wife and I will be back with our friends","3131":"LOVED Jane! This was our first time in SB and found Jane online as one of the best restaurants in the city. We were not disappointed one bit. The atmosphere is straight out of a movie, I think we said it reminded us of the little restaurant in Love Actually, since there is a cool little upstairs area.\n\nThe food was excellent, really nice big portions of delish food. Service was on point as well, our waitress had plenty of suggestions and extremely friendly to boot.\n\nWe ate lunch here, but would return for dinner as well. This is a must GO in SB.","3132":"We stopped here for dinner on a weekend trip up to Santa Barbara from LA. The decor and ambiance was pleasant and about as expected for a restaurant in this price range. \n\nUnfortunately the service was very slow. We got lucky and arrived when the hostess was near the front so we were seated right away. However we saw many people waiting for 10+ minutes without even a greeting from the hostess. It also took the waitress forever to come by to take out orders. In addition, the food came out very slowly. My onion rings were cold, as if they had been sitting out for a long time, so I don't think it was the kitchen's fault.\n\nThe lamb sausage and fettuccine pasta I ordered was tasty. The onion rings were ok, even cold. I can recommend the food. However, with service like I experienced, I would not go back on future visits.","3133":"Do not get a burger like I did..so disappointing. I was expecting a craft burger..especially being $13. I shouldn't known something was wrong when she didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. Super flat patty..maybe store bought? The buns were super soggy and the burger was falling apart. Was supposed to have saut\u00e9ed mushrooms but there were none. And the cheese was like falling off the patty all over the place. But my friend's pasta looked and tasted really good...so I guess you need to just order the right thing. Maybe I'll be back for wine and dessert, not sure about dinner.","3134":"I came to Jane a couple of days ago for my bday dinner. I had a huge party and even had extra guests come more than my initial dinner reservation, but they were very accommodating. I ordered the duck breast and it was amazing! Ambience is great, people were amazing, food was fantastic! 10\/10 would recommend! Def will be back!","3135":"The best seafood stew of my nearly 67 years on this planet.  Don't miss this if you visit my town of Santa Barbara I was born here, have visited 50 countries and all but 4 states and this was the best fish stew I have ever had.  Tell them Howard sent you","3136":"Great restaurant! Wonderful staff, lovely ambiance, terrific food choices. I would give it a five star review if my husband and I both didn't look at each other after a couple of bites and comment on how quickly our arteries were hardening from all the butter used in our dishes. He had the chicken piccatta which was divine and I had the seafood stew which was good at dinner and as leftovers. Even his veggies were doused in buttery sauce. Delicious, yes. Guilt-inducing, way too much. No possible way we could have moved on to desert without having a coronary.","3137":"I called during the week to make a reservation, for 8, in a quiet upstairs area of the restaurant, on Saturday, at noon.  My credit card was required for the reservation plus I was told a 20% gratuity was necessary.\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant we were taken to a long table that seated 16 and told that we would sit at half of the table.  The table was not in a quiet area but right in the middle of the restaurant.  When I mentioned we had reserved a table upstairs we were told the upstairs is not available for Saturday lunch.  Because we were very unhappy they agreed to give us our own table downstairs that was not particularly quiet so we took the table because it would have been too embarrassing to do anything else since we were meeting four of the people for the first time.\nI ordered a papaya and crab salad for $20.  I have never seen a papaya half so small and the amount of crab it held was two bites.  I will never go to Jane's again.","3138":"Our favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara.    Fantastic service and fantastic food.   Great selection of interesting beers as well.     We've been here 15 times or so.    You will not be disappointed.     Get the classic hamburger.    Very tasty.    There are many other much more interesting meals, but I just love it.","3139":"Saw this place while walking downtown, decided to try it out. Had a chicken, bacon romaine salad, it was the bomb! My kids ordered hamburgers, huge & delicious! The hamburgers were delicious & made to order, both came with fries! The hamburger buns are baked here also, & they were fresh & delicious! \n\nI had a lager on tap beer that hit the spot! The only downside I can say, is that they close at 2pm! They should stay open at least until 4.. But it's a great place for a bite!","3140":"Went here for lunch while passing through town. We had read the other glowing reviews and decided to give it a try. The place was empty at noon but filled up quickly. Service started out slow but improved as our meal went on.\n\nDelicious sourdough bread and butter and a carafe of ice water kept us entertained until the food arrived. Gorgonzola salad was tasty, perfect amount of cheese, great dressing. Thank you Jane for romaine lettuce! Chicken wasn't dry. My boyfriend ordered the fish sandwich. Ahi was cooked perfectly and not dry. Zucchini basil soup was a wonderful balance of flavors and textures, not too soupy and not too creamy.\n\nOverall, very tasty food, good atmosphere, extremely friendly service.","3141":"We had made a 6pm reservation for Jane a week earlier as we were spending the day in Santa Barbara on Saturday 11\/26. Upon arriving to a half empty restaurant last night we requested a slightly larger table as the two tops were tiny and crammed along the wall behind a large party seated in the miidle of this restaurant. The hostess was rude and unhelpful. She made no helpful accomodations to help satisfy us. It was either the tiny table or one outside in the dark on their outdoor tiny second story \"Patio\". I would have understood if we were walk-ins but we weren't. It's ironic to as we got up and left and went to a busier restaurant 'Opal several doors up and were accomdated immediately as walk-ins with a larger table and no attitude. I wish we could have tried the food here but I doubt we'll be back if we have to deal with her. Service trumps EVERYTHING! Even food. Learn it!","3142":"Jane's is a good place to go for a nice bite to eat if you're on State Street - not a huge menu, but quality food. I ordered a burger with a side salad and thought both were very good. Service could have been an improvement as our group didn't feel like we were checked in on often, but it was an overall very enjoyable experience.","3143":"It's just ok. You've probably been in a million places like this, around the country...paper menu, fancy salads, crab\/fish cakes. The kind of place your mother-in-law loves and is dependable for that kind of","3144":"Came here for my daughter's birthday dinner and thought this place was beyond amazing. Great ambiance, amazing food, great service, and they have a kid's menu.  We ordered lamb, duck and pork dishes and were very impressed.","3145":"Second visit to Jane and it was as good as I recall. I like that the menu ranges from nice burgers to filet (fits all budgets). It appears to appeal to tourist, bachelorette parties and locals. I enjoyed my mixed seafood coconut dish and my friend had skirt steak. Her steak wasn't as pink as she wanted, but it was very tasty and the potato side was very cheesy. Nice wine by the glass and liked to see SB local wineries on the list. We had the sundae and it was great. Next time coconut cake. Nice service too, I'd say a solid 4 1\/2.","3146":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!\n\nMy husband and I always visit SB and for the first time tried Jane after our neighbor back in LA recommended it. Boy are we happy we did! FOOD was fantastic!! AS a matter of fact, my husband is super health conscious so he asked for an alternative to the Chicken Picatta. I thought he was crazy bc the chicken Picatta is delicious just the way it is, and to alter it I figured, would ruin it. Well my husband said it was Excellent! The chef at Jane came up with something on the spot and still made it delicious!\n\nIf you come here I highly recommend the chicken picatta. Best I ever had! \n\nThe ambiance is very classy and the service was EXCELLENT. We tipped our waiter very generously bc he was amazing. Will be returning to this place every time we visit SB, that is for sure!","3147":"We absolutely love this restaurant.  Nicely decorated & inviting, and best of all the food is scrumptious.  I had salmon & my husband had a pasta seafood dish - I can taste it now!   We also loved the coconut shrimp appetizer and the coconut cream cake was good too.  Yummmmmm!","3148":"I came here recently for a business lunch. The clientele seemed to be similar, plus lots of book club ladies.\n\nThe menu is not complicated, and the ingredients are simple, but it's all prepared and presented flawlessly. \n\nI had the pancakes with smoked salmon, creme fraiche and caviar to start, and the butter lettuce salad with papaya and Dungeness crab in cream curry sauce as my main. Lettuce was crisp and fresh, as was the papaya. And good chunks of crab in the salad.\n\nOthers at the table had salads and seafood penne. Everyone seemed happy, and the one person who ordered the chicken and brie sandwich was almost overwhelmed by the size of the sandwich and the amount of brie. For big fans of brie only!\nAnd if this menu seems familiar, well, it's almost exactly the same as the Montecito Cafe. Same owners.\n\nInterior is calm and elegant, with high wood ceilings and a commanding fireplace that was heating the place nicely while it was pouring rain outside. The vintage photos on the wall are warm and intriguing, you want to learn more about the people in the pictures.\n\nGood place for a business lunch, or a romantic date.","3149":"Yama Mama, mama like!  I've been here 3 times now, and every meal we've had has been absolutely phenomenal!  Last night I got the pasta w\/ homemade lamb sausage, made extra spicy- and it was insane.  My husband got the seafood stew, which was right there as well.  Holy balls, I can't wait to go back again!  The service is right on par with the food as well.  You really can not go wrong with this place- it has the food, the service, and the ambiance.  check, check, check.","3150":"I was a bit sketchy-ish of this place... I really wanted to go to a different restaurant, but I'm glad my friend chose this place! I loved the food, I had ordered the lamb, my friend and niece ordered the steak and my cousin ordered the seafood pasta dish.\n\nWe didn't order more, which I was a bit sad, but we were still full and tired as we went hiking prior to eating (not feeling guilty at all).\n\nThis was our dinner before we had headed back to southern California. We came close around an hour before closing time... it was still quite busy and they had a party upstairs. Which by the way, I love the way this place was designed... something fresh and interesting to look at.\n\nThe food took a little while longer than i had expected, but the food makes it all worth while. I really would love to come back and try different entree and apps. It was a bit noisy due to the fact that the walls doesn't really mute the sounds in the restaurant much.. but it's alright.. we still had a good time.","3151":"Loved this place!  Great ambience, mellow and cozy.  They seated us up on the little upstairs patio, so cute and romantic! \n\nEverything we ate was delicious: The Greek Salad bowl (lamb sausage, yum!), rack of lamb, and grilled duck breast.  The only thing we didn't like as much was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. \n\nWill definitely go back here the next time I'm in Santa Barbara.","3152":"My heart and my b-hole couldn't agree:\n\nMy heart says Cute, Hip and Romantic.\nMy b-hole says Loud and Claustrophobic.\n\nMy heart says Friendly, professional servers.\nMy b-hole says they were too busy to be extra attentive.\n\nMy heart says the Onion Rings are greasy and overrated,.\nMy b-hole gives them Two Farts Up.","3153":"Ok tonight was clams and linguini, absolutely fabulous!  I have had this dish in three cities in Italy and it stood up and beat them all.  The raspberry sauce cheesecake with the 20 year old port make an excellent dolce.  Not easy to make me a total fanatic but Jane has succeeded.  And the price is very reasonable, if you visit or live in my town (Santa Barbara) put this eatery high on your list.","3154":"Jane is one of our favorites in Santa Barbara! Wonderful food and great service!\n\nThe seafood soup is my favorite with the coconut milk. I've tried to copy it but it's too good! The wines are local and amazing\n\nMake sure you go!","3155":"our first meal in santa barbara was lunch at jane. we beat the lunch rush, too. seems to be a place with a lot of regulars - we overheard the hostess (i think it was jane herself?) tell some guests that her first grandchild had been born the night before! it was cool to be able to congratulate her when she came to check on us at our table =)\n\nas for the food, we had the trout salad bowl, penne with bolognese, and the fish and chips. the husband enjoyed the flavors of the salad, our toddler ate most of the bolognese, and those were probably the best fish and chips i've ever had... BUT for the price? i mean, i realize we were on state street and yes, the ambience\/decor\/location was great, but the total cost just didn't merit another visit. actually, it was probably our worst meal of our trip in terms of man-it-was-good-but-we-should've-ate-somewhere-else.","3156":"Wonderful service, great food! My husband and I were visiting for a quick getaway and read the great reviews about Jane. We were not disappointed!\n\nWe went on a Friday at 7pm without a reservation. We were seated right away because we were fine with sitting on the balcony...I'm so glad we did! It was beautiful (and each of the 3 tables have their own heater) and romantic...with great opportunity for people watching below. \n\nWe tried the calamari, which was a lot for two people and delicious. We shared the wedge salad...amazing, I would skip the calamari next time and get my own wedge! Then we each had a sandwich ( we didn't eat it all, don't judge), I had the fish and my husband had the steak. I would order everything again. \n\nGreat food, great location, and super sweet attentive staff!","3157":"Umm like wow Yummy in my Tummy!!","3158":"What a gem---a delightful spot to be. We were at Jane last night for dinner with two new friends. We sat up in the balcony area and had an enchanting dinner for four. I had the Salmon and a Caesar Salad---wow. I love cozy family owned restaurants that have a distinctly California flair---and this one with a classic Santa Barbara feel. Classy, never stuffy----fresh, but creative. Service was wonderful, wine was delightful, food fantastic---and don't forget to have a bite of coconut cake before you head home. \n\nThis is a perfect spot for a night out with friends, a dinner with clients, or your parents---perfect for any occasion. Lovely. Thank you. We will be back!","3159":"My brother and his fianc\u00e9e selected this restaurant for their wedding reception. I didn't have a choice of wine, but the ones provided were good. I guess good taste in wine runs in the family  I couldn't eat a couple of the appetizers . The giant onion rings made with red onions looked really tasty. The seared tuna on cucumber with sriracha was fabulous with quite an afterburn. The cedar plank salmon would have been nearly perfect by itself if I hadn't already eaten too much. I definitely want to try this place again the next time I'm in the area.","3160":"Boyfriend and I went a couple weeks ago on 4\/20. We walked in and we waited for a host for a while, we were standing in doorway but we were spotted it was our anniversary and they gave us a nice seat near the window so definitely props for that!! Our waitress was a very nice and bubbly person, she was attentive!! Bread was old and stale but thats the only bad thing. I had the dungeness crab salad which was good it was very interesting! I loved it, im a vegetarian on non special occasions,  so interesting is good.  Then I had the lemon salmon and boyfriend had a steak. Boyfriend is very particular, he loved it, steak was cooked perfectly and he said it tasted great. I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon it was cooked perfectly. Only thing I would recommend is getting some good bread and this would be five stars hands down!","3161":"Found this place here on Yelp and it was a short walk from our Hotel. We had a 8:15 reservation and was quickly seated. When we asked for a different table Cody was very accommodating to our request with a smile. The atmosphere is very comfortable like a small country inn. \n\nMy wife ordered the mussels and I had the duck breast. Both were outstanding, from the salads, steamed veggies to the entrees. We both cleaned our plates. I almost wanted to \"lick' it clean it was that good. Great wines and the coconut cake Heaven!\n\nI notice when leaving Jane they were seating a guest at 9:40, their closing time is 10. How many places would take a customer that close to closing? Maybe a regular.\n\nEven though it was only 3 blocks from our Hotel. I would have walked a mile! Intimate, friendly service, great food, reasonably priced.","3162":"Jane was able to accommodate our large group on a very short notice.  The food was quite good and the service was friendly and efficient.  Absolutely zero complaints with our lunch experience.","3163":"My parents and I went here on a Friday night WITHOUT a reservation and were able to get in. There were very accomidating which was a plus since the reservation we did have did not work out. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant is very nice looking. But what made the meal FANTASTIC was the delicious food. Every single one of us were VERY VERY pleased with our meals. We all started with salads which were delicious. The greens were obviously very fresh and the dressing was great and not to much, I hate overdressed salads and these were perfect. For our main courses I had the veal Scallopini which was delicious. The sauce was great full of capers and the veal was perfect, lightly breaded and very tender. My father had the rack of lamb which again was cooked perfectly and a great mint rub on it, nicely complemented the lamb without being overly minty like over mint lamb pairings.  I think the highlights of the meal though was the Mussels. There were serves in this incredible broth that I could not get enough of and it as not even my meal, sorry mom. It was buttery with great notes of white wine and a good brineyness from the mussels. Although this was a special I hope that the seriously consider putting on the regular menu because I cannot wait to eat them again.\nWe were too full to have dessert but if there desserts are anywhere near as good as their meal and as good as the desserts I have had at their sister restaurant Montecito Cafe than I say order them, if you have room. Over all a GREAT restaurant that I cannot wait to go back to.","3164":"While in Santa Barbara, I went here with my family because of good reviews. There's not much to say about this place. The atmosphere was fine. The service was fine (somebody greeted us, took our order, and brought us food in a timely fashion, nothing more than i would expect from a cheap chain restaurant like chile's). Nothing remarkable.\n\nThe food is where things went wrong. For appetizers, we ordered the fried Brie and apple fritter salad, which sounded good. We also got the red onion rings, because onion rings are a slam dunk for us. Both appetizers were among the most bland foods I've eaten in my recent memory. Not good, not bad, just utterly tasteless.\n\nFor the main courses, I'm a vegetarian, and there was nothing on the menu without meat. No problem, they have a vegetarian menu. When I looked at the vegetarian menu, I was flabbergasted with how boring it was. They basically had linguini with vegetables or roasted vegetables. It is my personal opinion that if you cant be more creative than that without throwing a steak on top, there's something wrong with the chef. My meat eating dining partners all agreed that the vegetarian \"menu\" was jaw-droppingly boring, and even insulting. I ordered the linguini, hoping for it to maybe come out with a little sparkle of creativity that didn't show on the menu. Nope. I got buttered noodles with vegetables. \n\nOn the other hand, if you're a real meat and potatoes kind of person and you don't need an interesting menu or a different dining experience, a couple of the meat dishes that people in my party ordered were apparently very good. Among those dishes was the roasted duck breast, the grilled chicken, and the jane's burger with gouda cheese and caramelized onions.\n\nBottom line: nothing interesting or special, but if you're looking for a standard run of the mill meat and potatoes meal, you might be ok here,","3165":"We walked in late and the hostess was very friendly. She sat us immediately. Then our waitress came over with bread. Great service. Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to decide. I settled on the ahi tuna and broiled prawn salad. The salad was beautiful presented and a good portion size. The prawns were served \"fly\" style and were absolutely delicious. I finished with the white chocolate cheesecake. It too was very yummy. I would come here again. Great for date night. Cozy","3166":"Jane is so lovely. The decor is just quaint and beautiful and the food is quite elegant as well. \n\nWe had the lamb chops which were excellent and the salmon which was also good. We started with the prosciutto and shrimp salad which was was the best part of the meal. \n\nDefinitely make a reservation if possible. One small outside table which is nice but the tables just inside the front window seem to be the best seats. \n\nFriendly staff, clean, good food. Overall a nice experience.","3167":"I had some friends visiting from out of town over the weekend from Los Angeles. I wanted to take them someplace I know is consistently delicious with top quality so I took them to Jane Downtown. I sometimes go to the location in Goleta if I am feeling up for a cocktail since they have a full bar, but I wanted my friends to experience the downtown Santa Barbara ambiance. \n\nWe were sat on time for our reservation, and our server Johnny greeted us within moments explaining the specials and providing us with wine recommendations. We ordered a nice bottle of dry rose and started off with an order of mussels in pernod cream sauce. The mussels were perfect and my guests were in awe the whole time. We ordered a few more appetizers: scallops wrapped in prosciutto with a light lemon butter sauce, and the salmon pancakes. For our main course, we all ordered the New York Peppered Steak, except one friend got the salmon. The peppered steaks are divine, and if I am in the mood for red meat Jane is always where I come. The salmon came with a semi-sweet mango relish which was loved by all!  We were unfortunately too full for dessert, though we were eyeing the toffee sundae as it passed by our table on multiple occasions. Yum! I will continue to be a loyal customer to both locations as the food, service, and ambiance is of a consistently excellent quality.","3168":"It's a cute place.  Clean and busy!  The salmon sandwich was good.  The server took a bit to setup our drinks but it wasn't too big of a deal.\n\nThe food came quickly and was wonderful.  The staff during our meal was very attentive.  Overall, all of the plates were well presented and tasted great.\n\nThe sound in the place travels and bounces throughout the large room.  I'm sure it'll get really loud at times.","3169":"Everything I have ever eaten here has been amazing and everyone I bring here loves it.  Everything taste so fresh and the flavors are wonderfully paired.  It tastes like they just went out to a garden, picked fresh lettuce and made your salad. I adore their salads. Some unique appetizers as well. Cute place, nice atmosphere. Sitting upstairs feels cozier than downstairs. Jane is my favorite restaurant in all of SB.","3170":"This is the second time we've had a business party at this place. I think her name was Stephanie (super short blonde hair)....amazing waitress. We had a 13 top and she handled all of us perfectly. There was another guy helping but I forgot his name, but he rocked too. The rest of the staff was on it too, they get it, even if it's not your table you can still help out.\nFood was amazing as always, that's why we come back. We pretty much ordered every app, and ate every last bite. All of our entrees were great! Since we had been drinking the whole time I don't think anyone had room for dessert, but I remember last time we got all of them, and liked them all too. \nThey were extremely accommodating to us even though we stood after closing time. Thank you guys so much! I'll be back with someone who hasn't been here yet. Cheers!","3171":"roommate took me here for my birthday.  She didn't make reservations but they were kind enough to seat us at the bar instead of making us wait for 30 mins to an hour.  Cute decorations and interesting set up of the restaurant (there's two upstairs seating).  Romantic for dates! \n\nFood: \nPenne Pasta Shrimp, Clams, & Scallop \nSalmon\nCreme Brule\nSundae\n\n'nuff said.  I'm never craving for non Asian food but Jane broke that cycle.","3172":"Came here on a recommendation. The inside is charming and the staff are friendly and attentive. \n\nI had the seafood and vegetable stew which was delicate and light. The papaya and crab salad was delicious. However, the linguine with clams was disappointing. We were expecting something that resembled vongole but we're sadly disappointed. The pasta was too spicy and had thyme in it, both of which were too overpowering. The sauce was uneventful and was crying out for garlic and wine. \n\nDespite the bad clams, on the whole, the meal was nice and but I am undecided as to whether I would return.","3173":"I DID NOT EAT HERE, this review is for the hostess.\n\nIf I ever do I'll update my review, but we were not seated. Instead, we endured an extremely award moment with a pretentious hostess.\n\nGranted, it was the Saturday night before Valentine's Day and we did not have a reservation. We had been to the beach and downtown that day and my mother and I were dressed nicely, but my dad was wearing a windbreaker. He didn't look like a vagrant; he was not holding a crack pipe in one hand and a paper bag wrapped fifth of Wild Turkey in the other--it was a windbreaker. \n\nAs soon as the hostess saw us she asked us suspiciously if we had a reservation. We replied no and (I saw this) she pretended to look through her reservation sheet for about four seconds and gave us a confusingly worded but very clear answer. Something along the lines of \"I don't have anything\" (read as: leave now). No \"I'm sorry,\" or \"We're all booked up, so sorry, please let me make you a reservation for another night,\" etc. That is all she said. There was not even the slightest hint of sympathy or apology in her voice. Then we left with our tails between our legs.\n\nIt was thoroughly awkward and extremely inhospitable and it makes me never want to come to eat here, although I've always wanted to. It embarrassed my mother a lot, so I'm completely sure she will never be back.","3174":"Just fantastic. From start to finish. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Great service and great food!","3175":"Walked to Jane from Cheshire Cat Inn. After a long day of driving up from San Diego I needed a lite bite and a glass of wine. Special was fried prawns so I added a salad to it. Wrong. Prawns were servedp on a bed of butter lettuce, asparagus amd other clovery greens. Huge plate! So much food that I didn't even taste the salad. They were gracious and offered to take it off the bill. I said no. Anyway, the place is delightful. A keeper. (Note: wrote this last year! Review is for June 2010...even tho I only posted it today--it was stuck in Draft mode!)","3176":"Nice restaurant. It's upper state, so you probably only know this place if you're a local or got a local's recommendation (or yelp lol). The food was delicious. We all ordered various dishes; burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, pasta, steak, etc.) Everyone was satisfied. What makes this restaurant stand out is its ambiance inside. I LOVE the way its built, it adds a lot of character. It's homely. It gave it a good feel.\n\nHowever, I will say the service was WAY TOO SLOW. It was ridiculous how long it took to receive our food and to even order! Step it up. Minus 1 star.","3177":"Just stopped here for lunch as we were passing through Santa Barbara.  I fully enjoyed my meal.\n\nI ordered the steak sandwich and my husband ordered the fish sandwich.  Both were incredibly delicious,m.  The baguette that the steak sandwich was on, was fresh and perfectly toasted... I struggled with wanting to finish the whole thing, but being too full. Plus I wanted to save a little room for the coconut cake.\n\nWe ordered the coconut cake for desert.  It was light and creamy and not overly sweet.  The layers of buttercream and a nice saltiness that complimented the sauce that went with it.  I definitely recommend ordering the cake if you happen to stop in here to eat.  When in Santa Barbara again, I will definitely stop by to try their dinner menu.","3178":"I really don't understand how this restaurant has so many rave reviews. One thing I liked about the restaurant was the atmosphere -- it was cute. A really nice place to sit and relax, pretty intimate. I had a pasta with clams, and the sauce was a watery little pool at the bottom of my plate\/bowl. I also had the coconut cake, which tasted kind of like a vanilla box cake mix with coconut frosting. I had a latte and that was pretty nice, but I'm not picky with coffee.\n\nThis restaurant was very underwhelming as far as the food goes, I should have known better than to go somewhere on State Street and expect food that is actually worth the money -- WHERE IS THE AWESOME FOOD SB?","3179":"My favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara.\n\nYes, I've eaten at all the other popular spots.\n\nThis one just can't be beat for the price, consistency, and the lack of smug.\n\nStick with the beef, and that fried brie salad is outrageous.\nOh, and the house made ice cream shouldn't be missed, if the machine isn't broken that night!","3180":"I saw this restaurant in the magazine at our hotel but hadn't planned on coming here.  After my husband and I found out our our first choice (recommended by a friend, a sushi place) was closed for lunch, we passed by Janes and I immediately wanted to go in, the outside is so cute!  The inside is even more charming and romantic and I just loved it.  There's a huge fireplace that goes all the way up the wall to the two story ceiling, string lights, great wooden tables and upstairs seating as well.\n\nOn to the food...Obviously I was in the mood for bacon because I ordered the small wedge salad with avocado, tomatoes and delicious blue cheese dressing and the turkey BLT sandwich.  The bun was so good- soft and sweet.  My husband ordered Janes burger which he finished in record time.  Both plates came with yummy fries.  My only upset is that I didn't order any dessert!!  I had seen a cupcake place a block over and decided to go there afterwards, so sad.  \n\nThis restaurant met all my needs.  The quaint, romantic decor was perfect for our anniversary and the delicious food was worth going off my diet for!!  Can't wait to come back next time we're on vacation.","3181":"The highlight for me here was the medium-rare NY strip steak I ordered. This dish alone is worth going to Jane for. As I write this, I want to head over there and get it. This steak was divinely cooked - one of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. It was $25 - but it was BIG, came with delicious scalloped potatoes, and some very nice sauteed chard. The rest of the food was very good - including my date's seafood dish in a wonderful sauce.\n\nThe waitress was great. She gave me a bunch of initial recommendations that did not include the NY Strip. But then I decided I would order based on the most food. I said, \"what's the biggest portion of meat?\" She told me the NY strip. Now, I don't know it's the biggest they've got, but it was damn big and I was pleased by her honesty.\n\nAtmosphere is good, not amazing. It's very high ceilings, so a very open indoor place, which is which nice.\n\nAll in all, I can't wait to go back to Jane.","3182":"This is a charming restaurant, and I have been here several times - usually for lunch with a group, but now also for a dinner meal with a friend.  I've always been pleased with my meal, and the service.  Tonight, I tried the chicken piccata for the second time because on a previous trip I recalled it as one of the best chicken piccatas I've ever had.  2nd try of the item, and I can truly say - best chicken piccata I've ever had!  Service was exceptional, as well.  Kelsey had a delightful personality and easily joined our banter with out being imposing.  Very nice~\n\nIf you've had good chicken piccata, come enjoy the best. And ask for Kelsey!","3183":"Came here for lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this place was. We got to sit upstairs on the balcony (only 3 tables) which was perfect for a sunny day lunch. The place is very simple and quaint, which gives it a nice humble atmosphere. \nMy boyfriend had the firestone onion rings to start and neither of us are really fans of onion rings, but they were FANTASTIC, they had a really light firestone beer batter (almost like a tempura style) with a balsamic reduction drizzled on top and herb dipping sauce. I had the iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing with red onions and bacon on top. This is a pretty standard salad but I have had it botched before, though this one was perfectly arranged with a good starter portion. \nAs for entrees he got the \"El Macho\" burger and while he found it delicious his masculinity was slightly bruised as he couldn't finish the whole burger (the waitress comforted him by attesting that she rarely sees anyone finish the whole thing). I had the special sandwich of the day which was grilled ono (hawaiian whitefish) on toasted wheat bread with dill mayonnaise and avocado. Again, sticking with their idea of simplicity, this was light but filling, and the ono was perfectly seasoned and grilled. \nNow for the best part...dessert. We both had black coffee and shared a slice of the coconut cake, both items I am a fiend for, and both exceeded my expectations. I think she said the coffee was from a company called green star and it was delicious. The coconut cake was very light and fluffy and had a milky sauce on the plate. It was definitely the best coconut cake I have ever come across. \nAll in all we had great service, with a great ambiance and a fantastic meal. \n\nNote- they are closed on Sundays!","3184":"Very very nice place :) we were just visiting and the pictures of the food . Ppl posted was just incredible .. I would really recommend this great place to everyone.. nice and chill.. plus they got an outdoor patio which it's , I gotta say pretty nice :) ..","3185":"We made a reservation during the Holiday parade, a fun night to go out. We have been working on improving our diets (more whole grains and fresh vegetables) and therefore saw Jane with new eyes tonight. I ordered a glass of the Jean Phillipe sparkling wine which was quite good. The bread is cold and white, the butter unsalted -- I still don't understand why they can't add a pinch of Himalayan or Maldon salt to the butter -- a bland, boring combination. A whole grain option would be wonderful! I wanted a Cesar salad, but their Cesar salad is not really a Cesar salad (no Cesar dressing -- they should name it something else), so I ordered the iceburg wedge salad without bacon, dressing on the side for $11.00. I received a paltry chunk of lettuce that was room temperature with two slices of avocado, three cherry tomatoes sliced in half, and a tasty blue cheese dressing -- this salad was overpriced in the extreme. Next I had the local steamed mussels which were the largest and plumpest I've ever had anywhere, including Prince Edward Island. The flavor of the broth was fine but has cream in it. I would prefer a healthier version of just broth. Last, we ordered a slice of the Mocha cake. It looks terrific, but tastes like nothing: no chocolate flavor, no mocha flavor, even the creme anglaise was flavorless. I'll let my husband write his own review, but we were not inspired to return any time soon.","3186":"Mediocre in any way. don't trust the raving reviews! the cheesburger was done rare (without further notice), and you felt like chewing on an old living cow. rare can only be nice if your meat is fresh. this one didn't tase like it. only like moooold. disgusting. when we brought up this issue to our waitress, she was polite, but shrugged anyway. \n\nthe new york style steak tho was nice, but the \"seasonal veggies\" were overdone green beans (in numbers four pieces...) and overbaked potatoe wedges (was it two slices?). \n\npayed almost 90 dollars (4 beears, one starters more to count in), but for that price, we could have dined so nicely somewhere where they know how to treat their products.","3187":"Great spot for lunch. Dishes may be a quick reminder that this ain't health food, even if it comes from the salad menu. But I put such thoughts behind be when it tastes this good. \n\nOnly wish the French fries i get with the Jane burger, a lunchtime favorite, were actually consistent with earlier offerings from earlier years. The \"free\" bread has also changed for the worse recently since last I dined there, although it's still good.","3188":"I give Jane a 5 star rating as the food was so fresh and incredibly delicious. I elected to have the caesar salad to start and the Grilled Chicken Breast. I would certainly recommend Jane.","3189":"A very pleasant place and I really liked the server, but the food, sorry to say, was mediocre.\n\nI ordered a Sangria, more wine than fruit. \nSalad was best part. I got the salad with cheese and apple fritters. The greens and dressing were nothing special. One of my pet peeves is when hot food arrives tepid or even cold. The apple fritter I cut in to was so hot I had to wait to eat it! When I cut into the cheese, melted brie oozed out. Obviously just made, crisp crust.\n\nAlso got \"grilled\" duck. If it was grilled, I could not discern it; no grill marks, no smoky flavor. Just duck. I like duck but where was the grill? It came with chard, which I like a lot, but this chard was either old, undercooked, or both, it was tough. The potatoes (gratin I think?) were very good.\n\nI notice their dessert menu put an apostrophe in \"sundae's\". There is no apostrophe in sundaes. Apostrophes denote possessive (Jane's) or contractions (isn't). Sorry, I'm an editor.\n\nI did not get one of the \"sundae's\", instead I got coconut chiffon cake. The cake was rather dry and neither cake nor frosting really tasted like coconut, although there was an ample amount top and sides.","3190":"No reservations on Labor Day weekend.  Came at 5:30 (when it opens) and got a window seat immediately.  Wedge salad was good, but the Rib Eye (my meal) and Lamb (wife's meal) were great.  Dessert was OK.  Next time we will try the coconut cake.  Sevvice was good.  Megan took care of our needs.  She had a younger girl shadowing her, so they must have taken some of the previous service comments to heart.  Will return the next time we are in the area.","3191":"Dit restaurant was een schot in de roos. Heerlijk eten,  vriendelijke bediening en voortreffelijke wijn en bier. Samen brood met olijventapenade en pate van aubergine vooraf. Heerlijk! De bediening (Ben) was zo vriendelijk om ons precies te vertellen hoe de pat\u00e9 werd gemaakt. Daarna de filet mignon voor mijn vriend en ik de special van de dag \"moki\". Echt verrukkelijk. Evenals de groenten en aardappelgratin die erbij kwam. Samen met lokale biertjes en chardonnay (crispy) een super combinatie.  Als toetje nog de pecan taart. Goede afsluiter. Heerlijk gegeten in geweldig restaurant. Aanrader voor ieder in een sfeervol restaurant aan de hoofdstraat!","3192":"We didn't have a very good server. When we brought to her attention that she had accidentally served us unsalted butter with the bland bread they serve (the two tasted terrible together) she said that it was on purpose. When we asked if there was some nice salt we could use she said to use the table salt! Really?","3193":"Great food and service. The Pots appetizer was okay. The piccata and tenderloin special was excellent. The coconut cake is a must!","3194":"Food good, service excellent, ambience lovely. Generally, a nice night out. Great desserts as well. Note: the only drinks they serve are wine & beer.","3195":"The food was nothing better than wit u can make at home. Definetly not world's best. They had good customer service but not good food.","3196":"So the fiancee and I were on our way back to Ventura from Big Sur when we got a bit hungry and were in the mood for a nice dinner date, rather than the usual quick meal on the road. \n\nWe picked this place from Yelp while on a road outside of Lompoc going south in a hurry.\n\nWe got sat outside on this little balcony with only three two-person tables and heaters to take the chill off. Our waitress was friendly, our food was delicious and the view was great as we overlooked State Street and the Christmas tree.\n\nMy steak was delicious, cooked to order, the wine we chose also satisfied. Probably the only complaint I could make was that the service was just a little slower than I would have imagined.\n\nIt could be that since we just got engaged nothing could go wrong, but we still loved the place and would return again!","3197":"Great time. Had no reservation but after a few minutes at bar they seated us. When my wife wasn't thrilled with her glass of wine the waitress didn't even let her hen and haw. She said \"I'm taking back\" and brought her a new glass","3198":"Who can give a house salad 5 stars?  This girl!  \n\nI also tried bites of the potato soup, Jane burger, and fries.  ALL GOOD!\nSeriously, the caramelized onions on the Jane burger were a perfect sugary brown.  \n\nThey also serve a bread basket at lunch.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.","3199":"This is our go-to dinner spot when visitors want to hit up state street for a nice meal.  I recommend the chicken picata and onion ring starter.  My 90 year old grandma recommends the coconut cake!","3200":"My daughter and I came here with larger party for a birthday. The restaurant it self was super cute and in a great location. Our waitress was sweet and took her time explaining menu items for those who had questions. \nCon: I got my dinner (shrimp salad) 10 mins after everyone else got their meals. Not fun sitting there watching everyone else eat for what seemed like forever. \nHUGE Con: They will not split your bill. For a large party of people who don't all necessarily know each other this is problematic. It's unnecessary stress that I would rather avoid.","3201":"Onion rings like never before experienced.  Homemade hamburger buns.  Professional attentive service.  Next time they could yell at me as long as they brought those onions rings, I'd still give them 5 stars.","3202":"Dessert was awesome! Has the chocolate marquis and the coconut cake and it was delicious! It is very romantic inside and the waitress was very sweet. Wonderful experience and we will definitely go back when we are in town!","3203":"Yelp you did it again ! We yelped this place on our way to L A and it is absolutely delicious !!! The reviews were right on the money ! The prices are fair and the food is the best ! We had steamed mussels in an out of this world broth . Chicken piccata , their specialty  and Greek salad ! We will be back when we pass thru town ! Then we had the divine coconut chiffon cake with the creme anglais ... wow ! A must try !","3204":"The quality to price ratio at Jane is something of a marvel in SB. Like their sister restaurant the Montecito Inn Cafe I don't know how they pull it off. I've never had a bad meal and every time I leave feeling like I ripped them off.","3205":"A sweet, beautiful, and friendly restaurant. My brother took my mom and me here two years ago, and the food and service was great. Had salmon with mango sauce. Had a good experience and would like to visit again.","3206":"Food was very good, wine list not so much.  My wife and daughter had the chicken piccata, my other daughter the apple fritter and fried brie salad, and I had the lamb chops, all great.  For dessert, the girls has this chocolate desert which they loved.  Wine by the glass is another story.  For Chardonnay, your choice is a cheap MacMurray ranch, for $10\/glass, which you can buy in any grocery store for about $9\/bottle, and that is the only Chard available.  I guess they want to sell bottles of wine, but you can't have a taste, you have to buy blind.  They had a wonderful Alma Rosa Pinot listed for a very reasonable $38\/bottle, only problem is they didn't have the wine in stock.  And by the way, there is no hard liquor here, so don't go expecting a martini.  Good ambiance and service, but there is no excuse for such a poor wine list in wine country.","3207":"If you're looking for a restaurant that looks like the place that Colin Firth goes to in Love Actually to win over that Portuguese girl, then look no further! \n\nService & atmosphere: the space is cute with lights strewn from the ceiling. Since we were here for my sister's bachelorette, they were great in setting up the reservation and a super cute table setting for her. Service was very good and we got our food extremely fast! \n\nFood: most of us got the dinner salads, which were filling but still light. My ahi salad was light though I would have appreciated more of the dressing, the shrimp were super tasty and garlicky. \n\nOverall it was a sweet ambiance with lots of choices for our large group. Thanks for being so accommodating, even when we asked for a prom photo on the stairs! #basic","3208":"Yummy food.  Home made buns were amazing.  The staff was professional and appreciative of our business.","3209":"I'm not a big fan of small restaurants in such highly populated areas (very touristy) but I went into this place on a whim. I had a salad with lamb sausage I know it sounds gross but it was one of the most interesting and delectable marriage of favors I've ever had. The price was so so for the area. The service was good. But the food and the ambience are definitely what Santa barbara is all about. recommend for romantic light lunches.","3210":"The rave reviews are right on. The chicken piccata is exceptional and not a dish I would ordinarily order.  The filet was also outstanding.  The onion rings were yummy, the lamb meatballs kicked some booty and the coconut cake was light and fluffy   The ambience was great, service flawless and reasonably priced.   I will be back","3211":"Had lunch there alone. The service is very friendly and efficient. The food was good, but pricey for what it is. State Street at this level is high rent, so it's always tough to find a 5 star place if you include the notion of pricing.\nJ","3212":"i wanted to fall in love with jane like I've heard so many others have I took my mother out here on a whim, got greeted andseated right away. \n the evening was off to a great start til we had to wait 15mins before our server greeted us or anyone offer us water service...\nfinally our server showed up and was so damn slow at getting us water, water isn't a big deal but still.. Anyways\ntwo tables were seated after us, a couple and a 4 top and our server had the audacity to walk past us, greet and start chattin up the other two tables BEFORE giving us our water or talk to us about the menu. \n\nAfter notifying my server of our shellfish allergy all she suggested to us was shellfish plates, I had to remind her twice about our allergy. anyways we got our drinks and food order in right away \n\nBUT somehow the other two tables got their sangria and wine before I got my sangria, my mother only had water that evening...\n\nanywyas the Macho Burger was divine and delicious, it's a perfect blend of savory with a little kick of spice and definitely filling. \n \nmy mother had a pasta dish I can't remember which but it was also delicious \n\nour server didn't bother to check on us, only came to take the plate away and quickly give us the check, didn't even offer us dessert. \n\nSo needless to say I was less than thrilled at the end of my night. \n\nOverall rating I'd say 2.4 only because the good was delicious but horrid horrid server. \nI might give jane another try but deff not my first choice of a place to go","3213":"I wouldn't say this restaurant is bad or anything, I just find it mediocre. Came here with my hubby while on vacay in SB. We were looking for a spot for dinner and decided to come here since they had good reviews on Yelp. It wasn't super busy that night (I believe it was Saturday) and so we got a table pretty quickly, though I think my hubby made reservations just 30 min beforehand, and they were accommodating. We ordered the calamari which was lightly fried and not over cooked. (it was OK, sort of bland not anything amazing) I ordered the chicken piccata, again it was OK, not impressed.) Hubby ordered the mixed seafood stew, which he liked. I like the cute look of the restaurant but it was pretty loud when we were there. We sat next to a bachlorette party, there was another large (15+) party across from us and yeah, just sort of loud. Overall, maybe i'll be back but EH, not impressed.","3214":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend. Originally sat us by the stairs but requested to move as that seating seemed awkward by the stairs as people walked up and down, up and down. We moved upstairs which was much better. Food was good. We both had lamb chops. We also tried the red onion rings. It was just OK. Wish the batter had more taste. Anyhow, service was wonderful. They ran out of the one dessert we wanted to order so we ended up having to go somewhere else to get our sweet fix.  Parking is terrible. Other than it was a good visit.","3215":"4.5 stars\nMussel appetizer was delicious.  One of the best sauces I have had with this dish.  Had two seafood pastas and one was delicious and the other was OK.  Close to a 5* review.","3216":"Would have given 5 stars but the service was pretty darn slllooowwww. Its a full house and the only people in front of the house is 5 waitresses and Jane. And the place is 2 stories...so you could imagine the load the waitresses had since there are no busboys.\n\nBUT the food made up for the slow service.\n\nHands down THE best \"mexican\" burger that has entered my mouth (ordered the el macho burger). Also ordered the greek salad which was delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned patties of lamb on top of a lightly dressed salad. YUUMMMM!","3217":"Love this place! My mom and I were seated for lunch in the balcony area outside overlooking the street: super quaint, awesome seats! I had the salmon salad with tarragon dressing, and I'm pretty sure I had the same thing when I came here over a year ago, and it was still delicious! Salmon was perfectly cooked, all the greens went very well with everything.","3218":"The food was great, but was that because we had to wait so long for it?  We made reservations but the service was a bit slow and non-attentive.  Also out of featured beer on tap.....really?","3219":"The chicken picatta was amazing! The veggies and pasta on the side were very good too. Our waitress was lovely, and the restaurant itself was very cute.","3220":"Coming from San Francisco, we were told to try out Jane and had heard good things. However this was not the case. \n\nAppetizers- ordered the house salad which looked like something I could have prepared in my kitchen in two minutes. Was also very bland, to the point where I had to add salt to my salad. \n\nEntree- Ordered the fish special and asked for this to be well done. Arrived not well done at all,  and had it sent back. Waited for around ten minutes, only to be given back an overheated plate, with the exact same fish on it. In restaurant terms this means Jane's idea of giving you well done fish means putting it under the heat lamp for ten minutes. Gross. The only good thing about it was the sauce and the sides. \n\nDessert was brought out literally 20 seconds after ordering. This makes you wonder how long this had been sitting out previously, and if it was even prepared earlier that evening or days ago. \n\nService was okay at first, until we realized the server could care less about anything, including the whole fish left on my plate. \n\nOverall my guests and I would not come back here, nor recommend to others. 2 stars, because at least one person out of 4 enjoyed their meal.","3221":"My husband and I decided to have our wedding dinner at Jane after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The service for our party of 14 was excellent and the food was delicious. The ambiance was perfect for our wedding dinner, warm and cozy. We were able to purchase a whole coconut cake for our party and it did not disappoint.","3222":"Excellent lamb chops on the dinner special menu. I was amazed with the place, the good food and the service. Definitely will come back when I'm back in Santa Monica.","3223":"We came here with an out of town visitor after a 1.5 hour hike. Although famished, we wanted something that was both healthy and filling.\n\nWe started with \"Pots\" of Eggplant Pate & Olive Tapenade Grilled Flat Bread Brushed with Olive Oil. This was ok, not anything that interesting to me.\n\nOur visitor got the papaya and Dungeness crab salad, the bf got the Gorgonzola and chicken salad, while I opted for the Seafood Stew.\n\nThe salads were very tasty, although our visitor felt that her salad was too dressing heavy. The greens were fresh and there was a decent amount of chicken, bacon and avocado in his salad.\n\nMy stew was mediocre at best. It was a jalapeno, coconut and ginger cream broth with plenty of seafood: white fish, clams, shrimp, bay scallops. BUT, it didn't have too much flavor, and while the fish and clams were cooked to perfection, the shrimp and scallops were way overcooked.  I was disappointed and understood why the bf decided to enjoy his salad over really sharing our meals. \n\nI'm not sure if the salads are enough to get me to come back, but we'll see...","3224":"Love Jane's! Everything we had was drop dead delicious. The Calamari was soooo good. The salad with brie & apple fritters is a must. The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked with a sauce that made me want to lick the plate. My companions enjoyed their entrees as well ( FIlet Mignon & Skirt Steak) . The coconut cake was light as a feather and truly yummy.  We came for a long weekend and chose Jane's as the casual place to go the first night.  We dined at several 5 star restaurants but we all agreed we liked the meal we had at Jane's the best. BTW, it was packed on a Friday night at 7pm. Be sure to make a reservation.","3225":"It was my first time here, the food is good! It was the service that was not. When we were seated we got our menus and was told about the specials. 5 minutes later our waitress asked us if we were ready to order, we told her we needed a few more minutes. 15 minutes passed and the hostess is who took our order. We ordered a couple apetizers which took almost 40 minutes to come. I'm definitely not complaining about the food, but the service for sure! I might come back to give it another shot, but if the bad service happens again, NEVER!!","3226":"I came here for a bachelorette dinner and they were able to accommodate a group of 5 on pretty late notice. Customer service was good and food was good as well. Most of our group ordered the Chicken Piccata as that seems to be the most popular item recommend on Yelp and I can see why. It was indeed pretty tasty but not the best thing I ever had thus the 4 stars instead of 5. Also shared a slice of the coconut chiffon cake and even though coconut is not my favorite, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Rich texture but not overly sweet. One slice was perfect for the 5 of us. The atmosphere is also cute and quaint, good for bachelorettes, girls night out, and also date night.","3227":"Jane is definitely my new favorite place in SB. I love the atmosphere - it's like dining in a Tuscan villa. And the food is delicious, at really reasonable prices, which makes it a place I will be coming back to again and again. \n\nFavorites so far: Goat cheese pancakes, boston lettuce salad (yummy honey vinaigrette), and the chicken piccata!! It's in the running for the best piccata I've ever had. Can't wait to try the other menu items.","3228":"Enjoyed a Saturday lunch.\nPlace was pretty quite.\nService was friendly and professional.\nMost of us had selections from their \"salad bowls\" section.\nGoat cheese pancake and the \"Red\" onion rings were both a hit\nEverything fresh and tasty.\n\nFour stars","3229":"This is our favorite restaurant in town- a go-to for a romantic date as well as family gatherings. We went last Friday night, sat at a cozy table by the fireplace, and enjoyed the warm and cheerful ambiance. The restaurant always seems to feel intimate - maybe because of the two upstairs balcony areas and twinkly lights. We bring out of town guests here as well, for a taste of Santa Barbara's finest- tasty food and friendly service. \n\nOn Friday, we had the calamari to start (crispy, perfectly cooked) with the rose wine on the menu, which is delicious. There are many local wines by the glass here, which are fun to try. The goat cheese pancakes topped with salmon and caviar are mouthwatering. \n\nI enjoyed the seafood stew which is AMAZING- the coconut cream is combined with a variety of seafood, and my husband had the Jane burger, which he loves for the caramelized onions and gouda cheese. The coconut cake is famous, for good reason- don't miss it. It's light and decadent at the same time. \n\nThe service here is friendly and knowledgable, with good recommendations. The menu is filled with local options, at a variety of prices. I'm not exaggerating when I say that everything we have ordered here is good. This restaurant serves delicious food in a lovely and warm setting. We will be back again and again, as we have for the past 7 years since we discovered Jane. I'm already looking forward to our next visit.","3230":"Really good spot for brunch. The food is as amazing as the service. Lana was really kind and gave good food recommendations. Fish sandwich (fresh sea bass) was ridiculously good and my boyfriend got the macho burger which was also super bomb. Lana was genuinely helpful and left a memorable impression. Def gotta try it if you're in town.","3231":"Very modern place and I did like the food, but our waiter forgot about my wife and me several times throughout dinner.","3232":"It's casual fine dining. The service was great, and so was the food. But I did noticed two small things: 1. Their wine lists is terrible, and the waiter could not tell us anything about the wine either. 2. We had kids with us. They had a card placed on our table to specify what the acceptable behavior should be for children. The first sentence starts with \"We love kids\". My elementary kid immediately said, \" If you put this on the table, that means kids are not welcome\" Ah, agree with her comment. I know some kids are not well behave, but I could say the same about adults. This is the first time I see a card like this at a restaurant, I think it's funny, but also somewhat offended by it as a parent.","3233":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara! My favorite is the veal Marsala and the Coconut Cake is amazing! They have a great selection of local wines and the service is always pleasant.","3234":"We were in SB after a wine tour and looked at yelp to see what was good to eat in town. Jane immediately caught our eye and we headed there. 10 min before opening there was a line forming and half had reservations and others like us did not. Luckily we were first through the door and got a table.\n\nThe place has a great atmosphere and the service was very good. Very small and quaint place with an upstairs balcony and also outdoor patio.\n\nWe started with the onion red rings which they are known for. They were very delicious but can honestly feed 3-4 people. \n\nFor our main courses I got the lamb meatball  fettuccine and it was amazing. My girlfriend got the veal Marsala which was maybe a little salty, but still delicious. We did not have any trouble finishing it :)\n\n\nHighly recommend eating here if you are down by State Street!","3235":"More like a 3.5 (the missus convinced me to give the 4 instead of 3 stars... there goes my attempt to create a nerdy Gausian distribution to my rating distribution)\n\nCame here on recommendation from a friend, who stated it was a place with nice ambiance with good food that isn't overly expensive compared to other places in SB.\n\nCame here after seeing a movie, and was seated promptly. The ambiance of the place was nice, hitting that romantic\/casual setting. Unlike the larger tables for big parties, my table did not have porcelain birds as decorations (a demerit in my book).\n\nLooking over the menu, saw a couple interesting things to try, but managed to narrow it down to a few things. Service was responsive and swift, and after we ordered we waited a normal amount of time and then got our food.\n\nThe clam appetizer was good, but nothing special. The goat cheese salmon pancake was tasty. The lamb chops tasted like nicely cooked lamb chops. However, the steamed normandy vegetables on the side were a real dud. Boiled or steamed way past al dente, they weren't worth eating. In fact, I would have preferred if they weren't even on the plate at all.\n\nThe food as a whole was good, but lacking that 'Wow' factor that makes you want to eat there again. The dishes were exactly what you would expect if someone put those main components together into a dish; they did not exceed the sum of their parts.\n\nIn summary, a 3.5 review.","3236":"jane is my go-to place to get a reasonably priced excellent meal in a friendly, somewhat casual environment. Everything I've had here is top-notch and the menu is varied so everyone will find something. A must have is their famous coconut cake! Only downside is that it's always hopping so you may have a bit of a wait. Reservations are a must unless you go very early.","3237":"Fantastic find in Santa Barbara.  Excellent, fresh food and fast, friendly service.  Huge portions and good prices.","3238":"Lunch at Jane, food was very good, fresh, and well worth it's price. The reason I gave a 5 star review was not the food it was the service. They waited to clear all our plates until everyone was done. Thank you! I hate when restaurants start clearing when people are still eating.","3239":"Sweet Jane!\n\nGood food in a fun, festive dining room.  I really enjoyed my dinner here but nothing was truly exceptional.  I'll def. be back though.","3240":"The chicken piccata was to die for! The atmosphere great! Kelsey was a superior waitress, and the cheesecake was orgasmic!","3241":"Potentially the best \"value\" restaurant in Santa Barbara. Great food for very reasonable prices.\n\nIf you are going for lunch, you should definitely try one of their burgers. I love the Jane burger, as the gooey cheese and perfectly caramelized onions make it for me. If you want something a little more unique the El Macho Burger is also delicious. All burgers are served on what must be a homemade bun that is incredibly moist. If you want an appetizer get the Firestone Red Rings. They are crispy red onion rings drizzled with a balsamic reduction, definitely a little different but very good.\n\nIf you are going for dinner, the chicken piccata is probably the best I have had, it is really just about perfect if you catch them on a good night. The grilled duck breast is also very good.\n\nEvery meal starts with free bread and butter, which is decent but nothing special. If you want dessert, the coconut chiffon cake is delightful. The service is always great and it's usually not too hard to get a seat.","3242":"After hearing the reviews about Jane's coconut cake, I made it my mission to drop in while in SB...I was not disappointed! I'm not a coconut cake connoisseur, but this was the best coconut cake I've ever tasted. I was halfway through before the nice lady (manager or proprietress I presume) saw my cake and exclaimed that I had to try it with \"the vanilla sauce.\" BLISS. I didn't think it could get any better, but boy was I wrong! \n\nThe other items I sampled were good, but didn't hold a candle to the cake. I enjoyed the flavor of red onion rings, but they were a bit too greasy for my taste. I really enjoyed the fried brie and apple salad, though, which the lady kindly asked the chef to make since it didn't appear to be on the menu that day. I wasn't very impressed with the sangria because it tasted watered down, and I've had many a sangria that tasted better. \n\nTaking everything into consideration (the excellent service, decor, tasty entrees, and divine coconut cake), this place earned its 5 stars.","3243":"We loved this place the first time. Just returned for a birthday dinner this evening because our first visit was AMAZING! Unfortunately tonight the food was really off. We began with a carafe of sangria. It was delicious. Appetizers were coconut shrimp that smelled when delivered to the table. It did not taste fishy but the shrimp was WAY overcooked and the three out of four of us who ate it thought it tasted and had the texture of chicken (you would have never known it was shrimp other than the shape). Additionally, the breading was too thick and overcooked\/fried as well. Crab with cucumber, Brie with apples, and Pasilla Chiles stuffed with cheese were all fairly unremarkable. The chiles might have been the best of the bunch? The big letdown was two out of four of us had the veal Marsala. It was excellent the first time we had it but either they changed the recipe (the Marsala sauce was much darker and overpowered the dish with too much salt and too pungent). The veal was not nearly as tender and the two of us that had the dish again remarked about it when we left. Another had the chicken piccata which was very good though slightly overcooked breading but overall a really wonderful dish. The pasta bowl with scallops, shrimp and clams was not bad but too watery in the bowl and erred on the bland side. Scallops were fresh however. \n\nOn a positive note, the bread which is made fresh daily at Jane and the coconut cake were both PERFECT!!! Our waitress was wonderful as was the service once prior (both get 5-stars)! We will be back one more time as maybe they just had an off night--as it was very hot today. Additionally, they seemed to shut off the AC or it was not working well and the place was miserable. \n\nSorry for such a negative review but consistency is something lacking in many Santa Barbara restaurants and I think it is important for restaurant owners to know this. I believe Jane truly is a wonderful restaurant and we will try them again. I will be looking forward in revising my review to once again a 5-star rating.","3244":"Jane is my favorite restaurant.  My wife and I try to eat there at least once each week and as we try various dishes they are all delicious!!  We highly recommend it!","3245":"Great location, excellent food, great staff. As a San a Francisco food snob, this place meets expectations. \nAppreciated a wine list that features a number of quality Central Coast wineries.","3246":"In terms of major cities in California, San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles have always had a special place in my heart. But with this recent trip up to central California, it seems that Santa Barbara will be making this triad of favorites a quartet.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been in Downtown Santa Barbara... so long that I hardly remember it. Nonetheless, I fell instantly head over heels for this little section of the coastal city. With its impressive landmarks and affable locals, what's not to love? \nAnd of course, a block of restaurants that would make any epicure squeal with delight.\n\nOn this particular night, we decided to try Jane, a restaurant just a couple stores down from the prodigious Arlington Theatre, and we were far from disappointed.\n\nWe were seated immediately at 6 or so on a Friday night, in a stunning ambiance. The menu is full of original dishes that play up what would otherwise be considered traditional. After a minute or so, our group decided on splitting the \"Pots\" of Eggplant Pate and Olive Tapenade and the Goat Cheese Pancakes with Smoked Salmon as appetizers. I ordered the Half Papaya & Dungeness Crab salad, two others the Veal Marsala and the last person ordered the Grilled Duck Breast. We already planned ahead on finishing the meal with a slice of Coconut Cake. Since we ended up sharing everything anyway, here's my take on it all:\n\n\n\"Pots\" of Eggplant Pate and Olive Tapenade\nThough both \"pots\" (which were really just cups) of pate and tapenade were very good, I liked the eggplant pate just a bit better because it had a softer texture and flavor. The olive tapenade was just a bit bitter, but still very tasty.\n\nGoat Cheese Pancakes with Smoked Salmon\nThough at first glance it doesn't look like much, I couldn't agree more with the serving. Goat cheese can be extremely rich, and too much of it can really kill a dish with a lot of potential. So in this case, having a smaller portion for this type of dish, just a little salty and creamy but flavorfully harmonious in every way, was ideal.\n\nVeal Marsala\nWOW. The veal could not have been cooked any better! Though thin, it was so juicy and the marsala sauce was to DIE for. Smoky and earthy, I could have eaten this dish ten times over. Not to mention, the side dishes - linguine and mixed vegetables - were also good, attesting that they pay attention to EVERYTHING, not just the main.  \n\nGrilled Duck Breast\nThough just the tiniest bit gamey for my taste, the duck was also cooked to perfection. The wine sauce added sophistication as did the sauteed ginger. Yum!\n\nHalf Papaya & Dungeness Crab salad\nUnfortunately, there was one thing that held this whole entire experience back - this salad. Otherwise, Jane would have absolutely been five stars in my book. There was hardly any dungeness crab to be seen, and the portion was, admittedly, pretty small for a meal salad. Don't get me wrong - the salad was fresh and the curry dressing that came with it was delicious, but if the table had not shared everything, I probably would have left Jane still hungry.\n\nLast but not least....\n\nCoconut Cake\nWOW. Light, fluffy, moist, sweet... everything you would want to find in a great cake. The anglaise that came with it was thin and creamy and -- this description does not do justice for this wonderful dessert. \n\nJane is a great place to dine. The service is quick, the food is outstanding and the ambiance is one-of-a-kind. My only regret was ordering a salad... but otherwise, everything else was terrific! I can't wait to be back in Downtown Santa Barbara!!","3247":"Love this place... Its charming, food was tasty, and wait staff very friendly. Can't wait to go back.","3248":"Visiting from out of town and someone recommended me try Jane for dinner. It was amazing!!! Highly recommend. Our server was also extremely nice and we had amazing service.","3249":"We stopped at Jane for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. All of our meals were delicious, especially the fries that came with my sandwich. The service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was lovely.","3250":"Jane is so good! It's my boyfriend's favorite restaurant so we go for pretty much every special occasion. Every server we've had has always been friendly and professional. The food always comes to the table in a timely manner and is hot. The upstairs seating area is so cute and the chicken piccata is the best I've ever had. \n\nDefinitely better to have reservations than to be a walk in as they've been busy every time we've gone.","3251":"Soooo cute!! Love the food, love the people! Can be casual or also dressy. Great place! Not super pricey but still top quality.","3252":"Very expensive... They charge a lot for cutting a birthday cake. For the course, I had lamb shank, the meat was tough...","3253":"My wife and I were visiting from out of town and we just searched dinner places nearby and this place had good reviews so we decided to give it a try. Well we came here and I ordered the El Macho Burger not expecting much other than just a good meal. Well this was honestly the best burger I probably have ever had!","3254":"I went to Jane after seeing favorable reviews on Yelp. It didn't disappoint.\n\nI took a client there for a meeting last month. The food was delicious. The service was fantastic, too. There's a number of good restaurants in Santa Barbara. In fact, I would say there are more high quality restaurants there than any comparably sized city in the US. To stand out in Santa Barbara you have to bring your A game.\n\nIf you're looking for a reasonably-priced\/high quality sit down restaurant on State Street, you can't go wrong with Jane.","3255":"Wow, where to start? As a patron for lunch and dinner for over a year now, I've thoroughly enjoyed this place every visit.\n\nFirst, the service: Great service seems to be a dying art, but I guess they didn't get the memo at Jane. Nothing but a class act. The wait staff is friendly and casual, but not too much so; very prompt, obviously serious about their jobs, customer comes first. The one time I had even a minor issue with an appetizer (some frozen prawns were just kinda 'blah'), they immediately apologized, took it off the bill and comped us a dessert. Not necessary, but this kind of above-and-beyond service goes a long way.\n\nJane herself works the front of the house, and does it damn well. 100% class act and a total charmer. Great wine selection & suggestions.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple, clean and homey. You're definitely not eating in your living room, but the feeling is warm and relaxed.\n\n\nThe food: Excellent \"New American\" cuisine, flavorful, good portions, fresh, simple, nothing pretentious. Now, is everything on the menu five stars? No, but most of it is really good, and it's the kind of place where I feel like I can voice an opinion without feeling like a jerk.\n\nHere are some of my favorites:\n\nApps: \n\n- Mussels: Delicate, perfectly cooked, in a simple sauce with butter, garlic, basil and crushed tomatoes. Wow. Outstanding.\n\n- Grilled Pasilla chile w\/ Emmentaler cheese. Simple and delicious.\n\n- Mixed greens, fried brie, apple fritters, pecans & maple dressing. Great savory app; fritters could've used just a touch more flavor.\n\n- Goat cheese pancakes w\/ salmon gravlax, sour cream and caviar. Rich, strong flavors in bite-sized amounts.\n\n\nSalads:\n\n- They're all fresh, interesting, well-dressed. I enjoy the Greek salad with lamb sausage.\n\n\nBurgers & Entrees:\n\n- El Macho Burger. Juicy tender burger with a Pasilla chile on soft ciabatta bread. So so tasty.\n\n- Big Blue Burger. Mmmm, gorgonzola.\n\n- Duck breast. Changed my mind about duck. Tender, juicy cuts that were more like savory pork medallions than the \"gamey\" duck I was expecting.\n\n- Fettuccine w\/ lamb sausage. It's calorie city, but oh-so-good. Rich, tender lamb that accents the delicate pasta sauce very well. There's some spinach in there, too, so you don't feel like a total glutton.\n\n\nDesserts:\n\n- Coconut cake. 'Nuff said.\n\n- Apple crumble w\/ soft-serve ice cream. This was an off-menu treat that Jane sent us. To. Die. For.","3256":"We popped in here on a Tuesday night to get dinner before leaving town for Christmas. There was no wait and we were seated right away (definitely one of the perks of being walking distance to Downtown) at a lovely little table in the window. The restaurant was nice and relaxing, with some attractive mood lighting throughout it's two stories, and tiny tea candles at each table. The big table beside us was full of loud men, but that wasn't the restaurant's fault. \n\nOur server was a nice, genuinely friendly guy who gave us an honest opinion about our menu selections (\"The chicken picatta is a good choice. It's my wife's favorite!\"). When the aisle was blocked off a bit by the men sitting behind\/beside us, he just wordlessly made a detour and whipped around the other side of the table instead without making a scene or embarrassing anyone, which I thought was pretty classy. \n\nWe started with one of the specials, a Grilled Prawn appetizer which came out on a bed of wilted Spinach salad and bacon. A little pricey, at $10 for two prawns, but also really, really good. To be perfectly honest, I may have enjoyed the spinach and bacon better than the prawn! Mmm... bacon....\n\nI then got the chicken picatta and the boy got the grilled chicken. I ended up liking his grilled chicken better. The chicken picatta came with buttery veggies and fettucine, and was undoubtedly a good portion. It was just too rich for me. I ended up eating half and bringing half home. Both dishes were really well cooked and were presented nicely. \n\nThe service was just as attentive as it needed to be. The carafe of water was good, as it meant we didn't have to rely on the waiter for refills. The prices were pretty reasonable, considering the atmosphere and service, which were both excellent. It was really a good choice for a little relaxing and romantic last-minute dinner. I wouldn't recommend just walking in on a weekend though. I hear they get crazy busy and service can suffer.","3257":"Absolutely loved my dining experience at Jane!  Went there without reservations and the host immediately seated us at the bar and got us some wine while we waited for our table.  We did not wait long and were immediately pleased by the friendliness of the host and our waiter, who I believe was named Casey.  Casey suggested the chicken piccata which was AMAZING.  Also, we had some sangria which was probably the best I have had.  After dinner, Casey gave us complimentary ice cream (we had just gotten engaged).  The atmosphere was also great and we will definitely be going back soon!","3258":"Whoa! I don't even know how this place earned its 4 q\/2 stars. I have reason to suspect they paid all their friends to write reviews. When you walk in, its quaint and has a great use of space, upstairs & downstairs, nice.\nHowever, our waitress was tardy in ordering our food. Probably because they made her the bus-girl for the upstairs. No one was there to help her bus the tables. it was unfortunate, but to have to pay the price for management not hiring enough staff..i don't think so.\nOrdered the Red Rings, basically onion rings with a balsamic drizzle. Not good, full of grease! Don't you know you need to change your oil through out the day. Next the brie and apple fritter salad, must say the Arugula was very fresh, and the brie mediocre. \nNext onto the Coconut Shrimp, which came out overcooked, and dark brown... unfortunate. the sauce it was paired with was wonderful. \nLastly, the salmon was ordered...ggrrrrrr.... It was awful! We quickly checked out of there and ran across the street to Carlitos!! Great food and live music!\nExcellent Mexican food that is delicious!!\nSorry Jane, 4 1\/2 stairs.... YEAH RIGHT!!","3259":"We happened by Jane the Friday before July 4th. We read over the menu, did a quick Yelp review on the iPhone and decided to give it a try.\n\nWe were seated immediately at a table we requested on the balcony out front. The vibe and decor were top notch. Many items on the menu looked great but I started with the apple fritter and fried brie salad. It was a great new thing for me to try and it was damn good.\n\nI had the Chicken and (more) brie sandwich on ciabatta with fries. It was perfectly cooked, flavorful and satisfying. Steve had the fish and chips which were light, flavorful and a very large serving.\n\nWe tried the coconut cake based on reviews. The cake was very light and tasty but there was a bit too much creme anglaise for me.\n\nThe service was warm and friendly. This was a great place to start the holiday weekend in Santa Barbara. I will definitely be back.","3260":"This place is really great for a sit down lunch with friends. It's a little pricey for what is it which is why I gave it 4 stars but I go here all the time and it has an amazing atmosphere.","3261":"Best place in town! Jane and Montecito cafe are my favorite places in town. Jane has an amazing coconut cake and every dinner i have had there had been great!! Awesome service and great location on state st, just on the edge of the heart of downtown santa Barbara. Highly recommend!!","3262":"Love this place! \n\nFood is amazing best burger in town!!!!!\n\nLove Jane is in house everyday, and welcoming you to the restaurant. Pricing is fair for the great food you get, and service. \n\nOnly thing I could say would be to get bigger go cups for drinks orders.","3263":"Fantastic !!!   We are visiting Santa Barbara and upon our return we will definitely be back. Very friendly staff, excellent service, very comfortable atmosphere, and amazing food. We decided to go light for dinner so we started with an order of steamed clams and they were the best steamed clams we have ever had. They were served with a cream and garlic broth that was so rich and tasteful. We then each had a dinner salad and were more than satisfied. The salads were very fresh with just the right amount of dressing. We finished off our meal with their home made ice cream with toffee and carmel.  Don't miss this place if you are in Santa Barbara.  If we could give it 10 stars we would.","3264":"First off, i would have given it 4.5 stars if i could.\n\nLoved this place!  Great atmosphere, romantic even, with beautiful \" mood lighting\"  and charming decorations.  Very cozy.\n  \nPros: The mahi-mahi in lime butter (the broccolini was my favorite part!), and the alfredo with lamb patties, although it was VERY rich.  The server was very knowledgeable and friendly. \n\nCons: The service seemed a bit understaffed, it took a long time to get seated and get our food.  And i didn't particularly liked the fried brie and \"apple fritters\" ( the were just fried apple slices.)\n\nAnd last but DEFINITELY not least, GET THE COCONUT CAKE!!!!\nIt is super creamy and rich and a perfect ending to a wonderful meal!","3265":"The best seafood stew of my nearly 67 years on this planet.  Don't miss this if you visit my town of Santa Barbara I was born here, have visited 50 countries and all but 4 states and this was the best fish stew I have ever had.  Tell them Howard sent you .\nOn recommendation from my friend Jim I tried eating dessert, something I almost never do. I ordered Jane's Coconut cake, it is amazing they have  managed to make a cake that is at once extremely light and airy almost ethereal but so rich you feel you need to add an extra 30 minutes on the stairmaster to compensate for the epicurean delight you just consumed.  Bravo Jane!","3266":"Jane used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town, however, as of late, it's been getting a little disappointing and I don't feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for. \nThe other day I went for lunch and someone in my party ordered the Chicken Picatta (normally served with spaghetti or potatoes au gratin), this day, It was served with plain white rice. When we asked our waitress about it, her response was, \"On Thursdays it's served with rice.\" Awhile back I ordered it and it was served with polenta. When I think of Chicken Picatta, I do not think of white rice or polenta. I didn't feel we were getting what we paid for  (I know I said this already, but really, I did not!). If the dish is served with something other then what's written on the menu, we should be notified.","3267":"Stumbled on this little place and wanted to go in for lunch, but the kitchen had just closed. I thought it was incredibly kind and gracious of the hostess to ask us to wait for a minute while she checked the kitchen to double check, and see if the kitchen could whip up something for us. When she returned, it turned out they had already wiped down the  stoves. So we went back that evening for dinner. Such an incredibly charming place, and when we walked in, they had set aside a table for us with a little lavender sign, heart shaped, with glitter and \"Anniversary\" written on it :-) Our server, Jamie, such a beautifully sincere and sweet girl helped us navigate the menu and we ended up ordering their baby wedge salad and goat cheese pancakes as starters, and their cedar salmon (which Jamie said was her favorite :-) . . . we loved everything, testimony to which is my husband usually doesn't like a wedge, but in this case he said all the ingredients were well-balanced and the cheese didn't overwhelm the lettuce, and the bacon bits were freshly cooked and crumbled, the perfect crunch factor. The goat cheese pancakes were ethereal, light, fluffy perfect consistency. The salmon was fresh and moist with a light mango tropical salsa. The vibe is a bit like eating in someone home, and that someone is the warmest, most welcoming and kind family you can imagine. Though we wanted dessert, the sun was quickly setting and we wanted to make a mad dash for the beach to catch the sunset. We so loved the atmosphere and honest, zero pretentious food here, down to earth with pristine ingredients and cooked with solid flair :-) The service puts this restaurant over the edge and it feels as far from touristy as possible.","3268":"AMAZING!!! BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!!! \n\nYou have to try the Fried Brie and Apple Fritter salad! i used to live in SB and now i live in NYC and it is by far the one thing i miss most! Also the Coconut Cake is amazing. The atmosphere, lighting, menu, service, seating, location, everything about it is great!! Love it!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!","3269":"Beautiful restaurant. They made our intimate wedding celebration memorable. The food was great and the service was even better. We really appreciated them accommodating our vegan requests. Thanks for everything :)","3270":"if i were to ever own my own restaurant, i envision it looking exactly like jane. the ambiance is wonderful, with a cozy fireplace and all. \n\nservice was wonderful. they had complimentary bread with softened butter. we started out with tortilla soup. my DH had the chicken piccata and i had the salmon. the veggies in both dishes were nice and buttery, just the way i like my veggies. the mango relish on my salmon was my favorite part of my dish, and the fettuccine on my DH's dish was my favorite part of his. i regretting not ordering a pasta dish after having a taste of that.","3271":"This place is grea t! We got the crab stuffed cucumbers and they were so good. They were extremely awkward to eat but so worth it. The chicken picatta is to die for! My fiance loves chicken picatta so when it's not made right he hates it but this one he loved.  The service but we were in on a thursday around 5. We will be back!","3272":"Faves: onion rings, chicken picatta, Grilled chicken and fried Brie sandwich.\n\nCoconut cake had great taste but was a bit too dry, the cake kind of crumbled when you put it in your mouth. And the layers in between were too buttery. However the overall taste was not bad, and with the creme anglaise, it was pretty good. \n\nService here is amazing, the people here are really sweet and service is pretty quick.","3273":"Went on a Thursday night, strongly recommend making a reservation. I ordered the lamb chops and fries, and it was the best lamb chops I have ever had. The fries were rather on the cold side and the bread was not creative. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive. My friend ordered the chicken piccatta and it was so delicious, though i wish there was more pasta to go with it.","3274":"After hearing all the good reviews about Jane, the boyfriend and I finally decided to give it a try to see for ourselves. \nWe had made reservations and were seated and greeted right away. The server even brought us bread and our drinks right away. It did take 45- 1hr in getting our food, being a saturday night, it looked pretty busy. This place is pretty loud, in which we didn't mind, but you have to speak pretty loud to hear each other. We were pretty disappointed in our plates, I ordered the mussle linguini pasta and he ordered the shrimp and mussle pasta. Both pastas were more on the colder side, very very tasteless with no flavor whatsoever and dry. We shared a caesad salad in which the dressing tasted old and watery. We didnt finish our plates and didnt bother with dessert. \nWe were pretty disappointed because as much as we wanted to like Jane, it did not happen. Perhaps, we'll come try it again one day.","3275":"Went to Jane for my birthday lunch on July 8. We had been there once before for dinner, and always wanted to return, so where to have lunch was a no brainer. I opted for the Jane Burger and a Firestone Walker Beer. Hubby had the Big Bleu Burger and the same beer. Beer was great, very refreshing after a morning at the zoo. My burger had Gouda, Caramelized Onions and a Garlic Aioli. Delicious. It was the best burger I've had in a long time, possibly ever. Hubby's burger had Gorgonzola Cheese, Sauteed Mushrooms and Red Onions. He loved it, though he opted out of the Red Onions and now regrets it! I tried it, and it was really good, though it could have used the onions to cut down on the cheese!! Ambiance is great, right on State so you can people watch out the huge windows. Service was nice, not overly pushy, but there if you needed them. Will return for sure, probably for dinner next time!","3276":"We went here around November 2017 to celebrate my husband and I's anniversary. Service was okay, they got busy and we were understanding cause we know how it's like since we used to be servers many years ago but didn't like the waitress who apologized for the slow service but also gave a comment of, \"how they don't really sit people upstairs cause they get really busy and they have to go back and forth\" made us feel like a hassle. Anyways, 4 stars solely for the food. I ordered the chicken piccata and my husband ordered the duck plate, delicious. Lots of flavors, not too salty or sweet. It was just right.","3277":"I've been to both Jane locations on multiple occasions and am quite the fan.  The new location in Goleta is beautiful, but the downtown location has its own charm.  \n\nThe food has always been top notch.  It's hard to get in on the weekends downtown at least but I've been lucky for the most part.  There isn't really a place to wait downtown, so as a walk in it can be difficult to wait for a table.  \n\nThe red rings are interesting and I always order them for the table.  The winelist is very good and a bottle of Justin has always been available so far.  The desserts are amazing. I've had their steak a few times and it is always perfect.  \n\nThe noise level can reach staggering heights so I like to sit upstairs if I can.  Jane is my go to SB restaurant and I'm so happy that they have the Goleta location now.  Open for lunch and dinner, you can't go wrong.","3278":"My 95 year young friend and I had the most delicious lunch we've had in a long time.\nTrout salad and papaya\/crab butter leaf lettuce salad\/\nLovely atmosphere- good service and wonderful food!","3279":"Made a reservation at 8 o clock. We arrived at 730 and they let us in early because they had seats available.\n\nThe waiter starts by bringing over two glasses of water and a pitcher of water so we could refill our own water glass whenever we finished. +1 points for this. However, the pitcher wasn't useful to us because whenever we were low on water, the waiter would come over and pour us water FROM that pitcher. Very very attentive waiter! I applaud you. \n\nFirestone Red Rings & Spicy Herb Cream (9) - OMGGGGGGGGGG. The first bite I took, I swear I went to heaven. My mouth couldn't thank me enough :O (that's me eating an onion ring or being absolutely amazed) But after a while, it started to weigh me down. The batter on the onion ring was heavy (although it wasn't exactly greasy). But the spicy herb cream sauce worked SOO WELLL with the onion rings. Without this sauce, it would just be a typical appetizer dish. But with the sauce, it probably goes down as one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten. I kept thinking about this dish at night before I fell asleep, despite not being hungry at all! Now everytime I eat an onion ring, I'll think of this sauce. That spicy herb cream sauce...I will find out the secret recipe.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=nM4MBsC5FAEJi43QxXl-rA#i9yyROzfU3xs1Im0XWkPUw\n\nVeal Marsala Mushrooms & Fresh Herbs \n*Served with Vegetables & Fettuccine (18) - The veal was delicious. The vegetables were cooked down so much that it just melted in your mouth. My friend said the wine sauce was a bit too much and it could have been more reduced. But if you like the taste of marsala wine, then you should get this dish.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=nM4MBsC5FAEJi43QxXl-rA#nM4MBsC5FAEJi43QxXl-rA\n\nFettuccine & Homemade Lamb Sausage Spinach, Tomatoes, \nRoast Garlic & Cream (15) - The lamb was more tender than the veal. Both were delicious though. The cream was thick and it was not too heavy nor light. It was the perfect balance. One of the coolest things about the plate was the garlic. Instead of chopping up garlic, they leave the garlic in cloves. But the garlic was so cooked down, the texture was similar to mashed potatoes. I mistakenly thought they put a gnocchi on my plate, but I realized it being garlic. +1 points for creativity for including the garlic in this form.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=nM4MBsC5FAEJi43QxXl-rA#BhzRPSiNjgumbixsdrIZ0g\n\nOverall, the food was great, the service was amazing, the atmosphere was good. And yes, I'll definitely come back if I'm ever in the area.","3280":"The food here is good, and the people are nice. I come here fairly often, and my parents come all the time. My dad always HIGHLY suggests the fillet mignon!","3281":"That is one tasty cheeseburger. The waiter told me that the bread makes all the difference, and I have to say that I agree with him. Always good to be the person at the table causing the food jealousy.","3282":"Found this place through Yelp. T'was a good choice.\n\nCame in, saw it was pretty packed so hopefully that was a good sign. Got seated upstairs. The ambiance was great from the second floor.\n\nGreat service, very attentive. Usually going to nice restaurants with a bunch of college kids means splitting the check gets a bit complicated, but our server split our check up into 5 with no hesitation. I wish I could remember his name to give him credit for our really good dinner!\n\nThe food was just to die for. I ordered the chicken sandwich on brie. It was seriously a damn good chicken sandwich. The fries were perfect and if you like ranch for your fries, ask for a side of their ranch. Surprisingly, it was really good ranch.\n\nI was only visiting Santa Barbara for that night, but when I come back I'm sure to try Jane's again :)","3283":"The food was really good. For a restaurant like this it would have been nice to have a full bar. Loved the decor.","3284":"We adore this place, and ate there 3X in our month in Santa Barbara. Fresh, well prepared food, fast friendly service  We have only gone for lunch, but hearty dishes are available then as well.  If you want interestingly prepared versions of the things you love, this is your place.","3285":"I love having it so close to home. The cafe in Montecito has the same items. We always get the pasilla chile, and finish off our meal with coconut chiffon cake. It's out of this world!","3286":"Hands down 5 stars. \n\nWent here for lunch and will definitely be coming back. I fell in love with the place as soon as I walked in. The ambiance of the place is comfortable and the food is on point. \n\nThe red firestone onion rings with balsamic vinegraitte and aioli sauce made magic in my mouth. All the flavors went so well together. \n\nIn addition to the onion rings I ordered the Jane burger. The serving was pretty big but I ate every bite of it!!! \n\nIf you are in the area, Jane is a great option as among the many other restaurants in Santa Barbara. If you want a cute local restaurant with amazing food Jane is the place to go!!!","3287":"Came here for a quiet dinner--I ordered the filet mignon and tiramisu. The waitress was friendly and helpful, and brought complimentary bread while I was waiting. It was good, but was cold--would have been nice warmed up.\n\nThe filet mignon was delicious and perfectly cooked. It came with a side of bok choy and scalloped potatoes. The bok choy was good, but I wish there was more--there was only 2 of them. The scalloped potatoes were underseasoned but okay after I added salt\/pepper.\n\nTiramisu was meh--wish I had ordered a side or something else instead.","3288":"Setting~ cafe style\nFood ~ modern American\/Italian \nService ~ average to good\n\nThe +s. - seated quickly, super friendly servers, nice view of state street, warm ambience\n\nThe -ves - busy so service and food was slow. Two salads took 30 mins to come out, asked for table bread (run out), got the salad order wrong.\n\nWould we go back again:  Probably not","3289":"Cute. Friendly. Delicious. Affordable. Those are just a few of the words I would use to describe Jane. \n\nI took my mom here before an event at the theatre next door. We both enjoyed our experience very much. It was Saturday and we got there early so we got right in but by the time we left it was full so I would recommend reservations.\n\nThe atmosphere was very quaint and cozy. It was great for a \"girl's night out\" as I saw other groups of ladies there but it would also make a nice setting for a date.\n\nI ordered the seafood pasta and mom ordered the veal. Our waitress was super friendly and didn't rush us at all. She made us feel very comfortable. My pasta was great - lots of seafood - scallops, shrimp and clams, tossed in a buttery garlic sauce. There were big chunks of garlic so if you are on a date, bring a mint! My mom really enjoyed her veal. It came with a side of pasta and a side of veggies. She said she wasn't super hungry but managed to just about clear her plate that's how good it was. Overall the portions were generous. I didn't finish the pasta and I can pack away some noodles trust me.\n\nEach entree was under $20\/person - some might be higher like the steak but it's very reasonably priced overall. Especially for the high quality of the food.\n\nJane was the perfect place for a dinner with mom but I would not hesitate to take anyone there. I think all kinds of people would enjoy dining here.","3290":"almost but not quite there... the flavor combinations are often weird and dont quite pan out.  a fine meal if someone else is paying but i wouldnt necessarily go back.  that said, the outside balcony seating is sooooo romantic","3291":"Great food, but the great thing about is comfort. My wife and I felt like we were eating at a friend's home. Everyone at this restaurant treated like friends and as I said the food was great. My wife has the sole and I had the filet mignonette. Both were cooked perfectly. Their Brie with apples was off the charts. This place is our new favorite restaurant","3292":"I cannot say enough perfect things about Jane. I hosted my daughter's bridal party luncheon here; 17 women in the upstairs loft. Sierra took such great care of us! Perfect service: attentive bit not overbearing. Food: delicious. Four or five entree choices plus their small dessert \"taster.\" Delicious! Great selection of wines. An event or regular dining: this is the place! Also got to try Jane at the Marketplace in Goleta. Equally lovely and a completely different setting. Either Jane location: GO!","3293":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere, great prices. Any questions?\n\nOne of the things that stood out were the house made sauces - salad dressings, chipotle ketchup, dill sauce, etc. Wow! \n\nWe'll be back every chance we get. Do yourself a favor and stop in.","3294":"What a lovely restaurant. I made a reservation for a friend's birthday with 6 of us in total, and this restaurant was very accommodating. They even placed a snazzy \"birthday\" tag on the table to help celebrate her! Our waitress was wonderful. She was very helpful in wine recommendations as my friends and I have absolutely no clue what makes a wine a good wine besides the price indicator... we ended up getting a bottle of a tart Pinot noir to share that went really well with all of our food, AND it was like $40 that we all split. Score.\n\nThe food is very delightful here and surprisingly doesn't make you feel like you need to break the bank to go here! My friend and I had the seafood pasta that had nicely grilled shellfish and creamy white sauce. Ugh, it was to die for. The others had a good taste of the menu, ranging from the Jane burger to the filet mignon! And to finish, we celebrated with Jane's famous delicate coconut cake and a special pumpkin spice cheesecake. What a dream this restaurant is.","3295":"whoa! this place is awesome.\ngreat decor, very nice quiet, clean, and sophisticated atmosphere. the food was excellent and the service was just as great. can be a bit pricey for dinner, so try lunch first.","3296":"Wow, i was expecting a lot more, but was sadly disappointed. \nOur server Danielle was nice, but thats about it. The only reason I know her name was because its on my reciept. She arrived and immediately asked \"whadda ya want ta drink?\" ??? Maybe if we had a wine list....or when I asked what whites she suggest, actually having one or two that you ACTUALLY know...as opposed to \"well these are our whites.\" My wife and I felt rushed and hurried from the second we sat down. Not one time did our sever answer our questions to our satisfaction... My wife asked her about the burgers and apparently all she knew about the burger was its good... \n\nI reluctantly ordered the Creme fraiche pancakes which were Delicious...phew! Wasn't sure if i should...But yeah, very good smoked salmon with the most delicate pancakes...Mmm\nMy wife got the apple and brie fritter salad, which was not what we expected, and had a very boring arrangement of haphazard greens, dinosaur chunks of apple and brie, with a pretty boring un balanced vinaigrette. The \"fritter batter\" was like a tumpura batter on huge slices of brie and apple that left an oil taste and flavor in you mouth...Not Pleasant.\nThe Chops and fries were the biggest disappointment though...About 6oz of actual lamb that was very flavorless and bland...Zero Seasoning and flavor at all for Lamb chops, OUCH... The best thing on the plate were the fries, because that HUMONGOUS watercress salad was a waste of space on my plate to pretend you gave me some sort of value, but really, all that salad did was upset me from the second I saw it on the plate...\nI keep thinking back to when we sat down and were greated; maybe things could have been different with another server. Everything on the menu seemed to arrive different than expected...I would have rather had a plate with Two well seasoned and nicely charred lamb chops with fries on the side, THATS IT. Rather i got a huge bitter salad with two huge chunks of Charred tomato, a cup of fries with two dinky lil chops that tates like they were cooked over an electric grill with no salt and pepper or flavor or technique or sense of identity.\n\nI would have loved to get a bottle of wine, with some nice Chops and Fries, THATS IT...but apparently thats not possible after paying $120 for two people...","3297":"Best meal we've had in a long time. Every dish a home run- apple fritter-and-brie cheese salad, goat cheese pancakes with salmon and creme fraiche, onion rings, seafood stew, burger, fish n chips, best petrale sole ever. All incredible. Buns and sauces made in house. Charming atmosphere, excellent service, very reasonable prices especially considering the quality.","3298":"I visited Jane while on vacation in Santa Barbara, we had the:\n\nMixed Fresh Seafood Penne\nShrimp, Clams, Mussels, Bay Scallops,\nTomato, Basil, Garlic, White Wine & Lemon Butter Sauce - The seafood was fresh and the sauce was perfect for soaking up with bread .\n\nSteak & Frites\nFlat Iron Grilled Filet Mignon & Fries, Green Peppercorn, Brandy Sauce & Swiss Cheese Filled Pasilla Chili - the steak was perfectly cooked, fries were crispy and the chili pepper was a nice flavorful addition.\n\nJane Sunday\nSoft serve with house-made toffee, caramel and fresh whipped cream. This was fantastic, good combination of textures with the crunch of the toffee and smooth caramel.\n\nService was great, and the ambiance was nice. I will for sure return when I'm back in town.","3299":"Just want to say that we had some of the best customer service ever! If you come, ask for Summer to be your waitress. The food was great (four stars), but Summer was even better (five star). She even listened to our request on staging the timing of the entrees, so that they didn't come too soon after the appetizers. Not only did she frequently check on us, but made each step of the way delightful.  Thanks again, Summer!","3300":"Homie and classic. I came here for dinner twice. What makes this restaurant so special is the homie decor. It feels like you are eating at a friend's home, so it is cozy and welcoming. The portion size is very big. As a relatively small person, I can separate the dish into three meals. Food is delicious! Service is also good. It's also near the edge of downtown, so the parking is easier to find!","3301":"So this was a pretty big disappointment. I don't think Jane knows what kind of restaurant it wants to be- burgers and Italian food? The burger i ordered was cooked to death (i wasn't asked what temp i wanted it). Service wasn't great either. Would not recommend.","3302":"This place was great! Some of the best food ice ever had. I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly. The wait staff was friendly and helpful and the prices were not outrageous. $20 corkage few was a little much so we just bought a bottle there. \n\nCheck it out if you're looking for good food!","3303":"HORRIFIC SERVICE!\n\nI was in SB for the Jerry Seinfeld show and a acquaintance has recommended Jane so I made a reservation for 9pm.  I showed up at 9pm and was not seated until 9:15m.  While waiting for our table my BF and I decided what we wanted to eat so as soon as we sat down we ordered.  I ordered the calamari as a appetizer and salmon as a dinner and my BF ordered a salad for an appetizer and steak for dinner.  I am not able to comment on the food bc we didn't stay for the meal.  Our appetizers didn't come out until 9:45pm at that point my BF didn't want the salad so he returned it. We asked our waitress what the status was with our main course when she didn't return with an answer we then asked another waitress what the status was said she would check w\/ the manager.  No one came back to our table until 10pm which the manager brought us our plates at that point we were no longer hungry.\nThe manager explained that the appetizers were brought late because someone had \"stole\" my calamari which I ordered. Which domino effected the dinner.  In my eyes it would of been appropriate for our waitress to communicate to us what was going on. Instead the manager argued with us which was inappropriate.  I will never be going back to Jane!","3304":"I was joined by family members and all of us agreed that everything we ate was delicious.\n\nService was spot on in being ready to fill water glasses before we had to ask.\n\nJust a great experience","3305":"The food was good and the wine was priced reasonably, however the service was below average. We did not get our appetizers for one hour after we were seated, and we had to ask for bread to be brought to the table. The main meal was also dragging a bit. I would return for the food, however they need to hire more staff or deal with the staff that they have. Great food, poor follow thru.","3306":"Spectacular, lovely restaurant, with a cool vibe, attractive interior, great service and good food.  I ordered the grilled Indiana duck breast with seasonal fruit, citrus & port reduction.  I also substituted potatoes for fresh broccolini.  It came served at a perfect medium rare and was simply delicious. This paired with a nice sparkling wine recommended by the bartender was the perfect meal on an easy, quiet evening.  This place is popular so reservations are needed.  If it's a date night, request the romantic upstairs seating.  What a absolutely delightful find while on business in Santa Barbara!","3307":"Order the firestone red onion rings- it was crispy and light and had a drizzling of balsamic vinegraitte reduction with aoili sauce. We devoured these. The chicken piccata was very good, with a white wine reduction and a side of vegetables and potatoes. I really liked the farmers market salad, so fresh with the lemon vinagreitte dressing. The salad came in a huge bowl but I finished it. \n\nCharming interior, but service was excruciatingly slow and the waiters were not that friendly. It took so long to get our water refilled and we had to keep flagging them down. I also asked for green tea and the waiter brought green tea with lemongrass... and I hate lemongrass.","3308":"We had such a weak service. Never wanna go even though the food was good. \n\nMy boyfriend chose this place to celebrate my birthday for me. Idk if the waitress was jealous of me or whatever, she didn't give us bread at all, she behaved casually, no respects. After we finished all the plates, she just put two pictures of desserts in front of us and asked if I want more drinks and left. We thought there would be something special for a birthday so we were just waiting. And she came back after a while and asked us \"So any desserts?\" We were like \"what are those pictures for?\" We got confused because we couldn't see these prices. Those were literally just pictures of their sweets. We just ordered one thing and left the restaurant. I'm not saying that I wanted to be celebrated. I felt bad for my boyfriend who made an appointment secretly and readied to have a wonderful birthday dinner for me. \nEven though the food was good, after having this experience, their food would taste bad to me","3309":"My husband loves this place so we go whenever we are in SB.  I like the restaurant itself - the room is pleasant and the service is very good.  I always enjoy my food there but it's not OMG I could die...it's just very good.  It might be the menu choices...or it may be more \"foodie\" orientate and I'm not.  The last time we were here - I had soup - which was good but I can't remember it - like I can't remember what kind it was so it wasn't earthshakingly fabulous...it was fine.  And I had the crab salad - which was good - simple enough for non-foodie me and the crab was very fresh tasting and that's all that counts with me.  My husband had the daily special which I think was some kind of steak tacos - he devoured it so that must have been great.  I didn't even get a bite...","3310":"Absolutely lovely! Came here with 15 people after my wedding ceremony at the courthouse. We sat at the community table in the main dining hall, emailed our app orders ahead of time, and all was ready as soon as we arrived. Service was amazing, they even let my mom in before the restaurant opened so she could decorate the table.","3311":"My bachelorette party had reservations and I was pleased with my food visit! The service was friendly. I ate the Linguini & Clams it was lightly butter and well seasoned! The Coconut Chiffon Cake was a perfect pairing to my night. The cake was fluffy with a dulce de leche, whipped cream in the middle. Must try for all those sweet tooth lovers.","3312":"Jane offers exceptional food, a beautiful and quiet setting and professional service. Plates are prepared to perfection, the goat cheese pancakes were phenomenal! Cheyne and Cody provided us with attentive and accommodating service. I'll be back!","3313":"I haven't updated my review in a while. We love the restaurant. Great people. Great atmosphere.  Fantastic food. Still our favorite. We don't go to Santa Barbara without eating here.","3314":"You want to talk about fantastic restaurants.... well - this is it!  The food was excellent! Every dish.   The service was excellent.  The ambiance..... the bottle of wine..... the entire vibe.    Thank you for such a delicious meal!  We had such a fantastic time!","3315":"I ATE ALL THE STRING BEANS. Perhaps a funny way to begin a Yelp review, but let me emphasize, that I rarely eat string beans, and I rarely care to finish all of them when I do. THAT'S HOW GOOD JANE IS. For starters, the service was A+. Our waitress seemed vested in the restaurant -- that's how good we were treated, a marked change from most servers in SB. Seriously this is the anti-State Street resto. It's elegant, it's delicious, and it's not too expensive. Our server recommended an amazing Syrah, and everything was done very nicely, with a smart twist on the classics and emphasis on freshness as well as local cuisine. I'd give you all the details of our dishes, but that's not important because this is actually a RESTAURANT YOU CAN TRUST WITH EVERYTHING. That is super-rare, and I can't even believe I had this experience, and had it in SB, but I did, and so did my friend, and so did others we spoke to and observed. GO TO JANE.","3316":"The food was good except for the salad which was misrepresented to us. The dressing was supposed to be Honey and something else but turned out to be watered down  mayonnaise. We Notify them ahead of time we were celebrating birthdays. After dinner we were not offered a birthday dessert however others around us were being served the birthday desert. When we called and asked why we weren't offered one we were told they no longer do this. Also they added two dollars to our tip without notifying us. Waitress was blah.","3317":"This place has been wonderful every single time we have gone.  Delicious and fresh food with great service!","3318":"Yup, you should eat here. Super crowded tonight with large parties, but we were still seated quickly. Great, friendly service, And seriously good food. I had the sea bass with cranberry-terragon butter, and it was awesome. My little guy had pasta bolognase and it was super. The pecan tart was just sweet enough to be a perfect finish. Like I said, you should eat here.","3319":"Our group went to Jane's in Santa Barbara the other night for dinner. It was awful. Hardly any vegetable selections. The linguine with clam sauce was a joke. One needed a magnifying glass to see the few tiny manila clams - most were empty shells! No side vegetables came with it. The papaya stuffed with crabmeat was 3\/4 lettuce. Ambiance zero! The waitress had a 'blah' attitude as well... No seasonings, only wine or beer, hard wooden chairs, but a big bill for all of this. Is this restaurant under new ownership? The reviews we'd read were so glowing.\n\nIf our experience is the new norm, Jane's ought to be out of business a year from now.","3320":"Before this year, it had been a Dog's Age at least since the last time I visited Santa Barbara - so long that all I remembered vividly were the beaches.  I particularly did NOT remember any exceptional restaurants, so I asked around among my Yelp friends for recommendations.  It turned out that Sidney S., that Legendarily tireless Yelper who loves awesome hiking venues and fine red wines, has visited SB almost as many times as I've been to Paxti's.  I hit him up for some advice and he lead off with: \n\n\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be,\n For loan oft loses both itself and friend,\n And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\"\n\nWhen I convinced him I didn't need cash, he then proceeded to share several spot-on recommendations.  The first of these was what also turned out to be the best restaurant I visited in Santa Barbara this trip - Jane.\n\nMy Compadres and I drove into town on the first day, settled into our hotel, and then set out for what we hoped would be an exceptional dinner to commemorate the start of our Santa Barbara trip.  Jane turned out to be a really cozy, romantic little place on State Street, which Sidney had described as slightly upscale while still being casual and friendly - that's exactly what it was!  When we arrived we were seated at a table in front of the fireplace (not burning that evening, but still cheery).  The ambiance at this place is amazingly romantic; it's not only an exceptionally pleasant place to share a meal with friends, it would also be an excellent place for a date with that special someone...\n\nThe service at Jane is darn close to perfect; attentive without being overpowering; you feel very taken care of, but they're not intrusive.  Corkage is $20; I brought along a bottle of 2006 Turnbull Cabernet that evening, along with my trusty traveling aerator. \n\nThe first of the culinary highlights of our meal was the Firestone Red (Onion) Rings & Spice Herb Cream.   http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g#8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g  Deliciously spicy, the batter was crunchy, hot, and wonderful!  The second was a small mountain of crispy and addictive fries disguised as a side that came with one of my Compadres' burger.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ#aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ The third were some surprising tasty vegetables!  These last I'm proud to say I ate, but am embarrassed to note that I wasn't sure what they were at first, and I had to ask - they were Broccolini (a green vegetable similar to broccoli; it's a hybrid of broccoli and kai-lan, Chinese broccoli).\n\nOur entrees were all excellent!  I had the grilled Filet Mignon served with a deliciously savory Oyster Mushroom & Herb Cream sauce.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ#JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ It was tender, well season, and perfectly cooked to the medium I had requested.  One of my Compadres had the Classic Cheese Burger (Provolone, Tomato, Lettuce, Red Onion, Dijon & Mayonnaise) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w#avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w and my Pasta-crazed Compadre had (wait for it...) Pasta! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jane-santa-barbara?select=8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g#8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g I tried a bite of the burger, and if I my steak wasn't as good as it was, I would have pushed it aside and ordered a burger myself - it was superb! \n\nMy experience at Jane was five stars from beginning to end.  I have no hesitation about either recommending it, or coming back when next I'm in Santa Barbara.  \n\nGood call, Sidney!","3321":"I truly love this reatuarant.  The Location is perfect -- right in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.  The wine is wonderful and reasonable (no bar).  The food is captivating and the staff knowledgeable and friendly.  Their pasta dishes are fresh and yummy.  Anyone who is studying at the Hudson Institute should visit this restaurant for all three of your CIT's.","3322":"Delicious food, nearly half the cost of our meal the night previous, and twice as good. I ordered the cedar salmon, which had a wonderful woody, smoked flavor that made the fish a memorable dish. My father ordered the pork tenderloin and had no complaints, the crab cakes were a strong contender as well. The dessert we got was Jane's Sundae, and it was INCREDIBLE. DEVINE. BEST. I wasn't even hungry and it was cleaned out within two minutes. The waiters were helpful and informative, making wise and decisive tips on what to order. I made reservations in advance which was a good decision. I would come back to this restaurant in a heartbeat. Thanks for the wonderful meal!","3323":"What a wonderful evening we had 6 high school friends enjoying a fantastic meal. Gorgeous table, attentive service, I loved the amazing Halter Wine, delicious salmon dinner and lovely desert their signature coconut cake. Each of us enjoyed the meal we ordered, duck, chicken and burger. I wish we had this darling restaurant in San Clemente where I live I would frequent it once a week! Thank you Jane for a delightful meal.","3324":"I really enjoyed the salmon dish which was perfectly cooked and paired with a tasty fruit relish.  I wasn't impressed with their wine by the glass offerings.","3325":"It has been a few years since I ate at Jane's so we where excited to have a date night here before a show this week. I was initially disappointed that they do not have the fish and chips that I (and others) have been declaring the best in SB for years. I was really pumped for that dish but I was not disappointed with the other dishes we substituted. The artichokes were super delirious (so I decided to mentally block out the buttery guilt). The seasonal beet salad was great as well. The fried pear and brie dish was pretty good too. The seafood ginger coconut stew was a little bland. It did seem fresh so if you like fresh seafood and 'play it safe' like my parents do, I would recommend it. I heard people raving about the pasta next to us and will try that next time. \n\nThe service was great, friendly, cooperative team among staff and attentive. \n\nTip: The white napkins left my wife and I covered in lint (both wearing black attire) and heading to CVS for a roller. Perhaps we should have asked for black napkins.","3326":"We had a lovely evening here. We had the special beet grapefruit salad which I loved, grilled artichoke and aioli was perfectly prepared, linguini and clams best I've had with big clams in shell and my husband had a great chicken Marsala. Service excellent! Always a great meal","3327":"Visiting from out of town and found Janes on yelp, it was also recommended by a bartender at our hotel. It did not disappoint. I had the chicken piccata and janes sundae for dessert. My husband had the seafood penne and the daily special fruit cobbler. We both really enjoyed our meals and desserts- very good! Service was good too. I was tempted to get the coconut cake but decided on the sundae. We will have to come back soon.","3328":"Came here on a lunch date with my boyfriend for his birthday. Super cute and fun restaurant with a pretty, modern atmosphere. Service is very friendly and fast. Good for birthdays and dates, and really yummy food! Right next to the Arlington Theater so would recommend if you have a show to go to and want to eat before\/ after. Definitely would come here again, 5 stars","3329":"This is a review for lunch only. I really, really love this place. The atmosphere is very laid back California, but also classy. Quintessential Santa Barbara. Restaurants come and go in SB, but Jane is always consistent. Like visiting an old friend. They sat us upstairs on the balcony, which was awesome. Pretty views of downtown and a beautiful winter day in the high 60s. It was literally perfect weather.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n-baby wedge salad\n-chicken and fried Brie sandwich with fries\n\nThe wedge was in the small size. Not a lot of food if you're sharing. Had all the usual components, and tasty\n\nThe sandwich was good, not the best. The chicken was dry and seemed over cooked. The fried Brie and French fries were delicious. \n\nThis place is a good solid place for lunch and dinner before a show at the Arlington, which is next door. I will always come back to Jane. Definitely a treasure downtown and never super touristy:).","3330":"Jane should be on the top of the list when in Santa Barbara. The food is delicious;?Farm to table fresh. The coconut cake is heavenly! And the service excellent, the staff is kind and attentive. \n\nI don't give a five star review lightly however Jane definitely deserves it!","3331":"Possibly best fresh calamari I've ever had. Friendly service and great food. Try the lemonade.","3332":"chicken piccata OMG. ok so I've been to SB once, and Jane has become a household name because of this dish. my brother and I talk about making a day-trip out of going to get this again. honestly best chicken piccata i've ever had in my life. i am not exaggerating.","3333":"I can't say enough great things about Jane! I recently had  a wedding reception dinner here for 35 people. We reserved the upstairs area and it was perfect! The food was amazing and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone loved it! They even let me bring in my own decorations and helped us out with setting everything up!","3334":"I had the fish sandwich --- that day was mahi mahi --- it was really good... My wife got the clams linguini --- which was so so only. They have complimentary bread and also the people there are nice and friendly.","3335":"I like taking the train to Santa Barbara because it's a quiet, relaxing place. Jane is the perfect fit. The place is small but the service and food is very good. I just got the plain burger since I was planning on getting a pizza on the way back to the train. I also had iced tea. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection. The fries were the bomb too. I liked that they bring you a small pitcher to refill your tea. This is a place I would definitely return to.","3336":"Wonderfully delicious meal during restaurant week. Started with an incredible Smoked Duck salad in raspberry vinaigrette. Duck was done so well I wished there was less vinaigrette. Not that it was overpowering as there was almost none on the plate when I finished, just duck, mangos, raspberries were well proportioned. Then I had the seafood Cioppino. Plenty of mussels, clams, and delicate fish. Mussels were a little earthy, but broth and other seafood were great. Finished with a nice Tiramisu. Also had a waitress who was very attentive - and I noticed good cooperation among all serving the main dining room. When back in SB, will have to come again.","3337":"Favorite restaurant in SB.\n\nThe filet mignon (you can request for lunch even if not on menu) has the the best sauce that makes it the best steak experience (no need for fancy prime steak houses).  Always my go to.\n\n(Opal next door also has a great filet with some wine sauce when tried years ago.  Just the mushroom cream gravy like sauce at Jane is too addicting so always end up at Jane...)\n\nBut then finally tried their famous chicken picatta some 2 years ago and oh boy...  been dreaming of it since even more than the filet.  Missed the Jane lunch times the past 2 trips, but came prepared this time and finally got to eat it again.\nChicken was a bit chewy this time and the capers or sauce was not quite as explosive as 2 years ago, but don't get me wrong it was fantastic.  Cleared my plate clean and wife and baby did same to her order (it was that memorable, we both had to order our own this time instead of the filet & chicken like last time), lol.\n\nQuantities are a bit lacking (small filet or 2 small\/thin chicken breasts), but the flavors make up for it I guess.  And daytrips to SB always involves being overstuffed all day anyway, so it works out just fine.\n\nSeems like they make their own bread and sauces for their burgers, maybe I need to try one of those next time.  But how can I ever try if the filet and chicken piccata are just too good to skip?  Maybe lunch and dinner?","3338":"The \"go-to\" choice when my wife and I want consistently excellent food and a quiet night away from the kids.  Good stuff!","3339":"Great food and atmosphere.  The food is amazing and the ambiance enlightening! The calamari was fresh and delicious.  The duck was perfectly cooked.  The seafood pasta was amazing and service was fantastic!","3340":"Well that was probably the past meal I will ever eat at Jane. Although the service was lovely and the Boston butter lettuce salad was tasty, the choices off the vegetarian menu have gotten to the point of being inedible. I ordered an eggplant dish as the only entree that was vegetarian and not pasta. What came was a giant plate of under cooked baked eggplant slices swimming in flavorless red sauce with some cooked red peppers and spinach. It was nearly inedible and I would've sent it back but I didn't want to offend the person whose guest I was. The Cabernet blend wine was good but at 15 a glass was overpriced. The rest of the wine menu was the kind of thing you would expect to find in your grocery store, not a good restaurant, And not a restaurant in a region known for its good quality wines.","3341":"Very tasty boutique restaurant in Santa Barbara. Food was delicious and service was great.","3342":"What a terrific restaurant!\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed a date night featuring the following delicious fare.\n\nDrinks: Red Wine Sangria; Juage Sauternes\n\nAppetizers: Frisee, Endive, & Goat Cheese Fritter Salad; Goat Cheese Pancakes\n\nMain: The El Macho Burger; Grilled Indiana Duck Breast\n\nDessert: Strawberry Swirl Sundae; Coconut Chiffon Cake\n\nIf only they had a full bar, I might have awarded a fifth star :-)","3343":"I highly recommend this restaurant. The food was  delicious and the service was great. I'll be sure to go there again when I'm in Santa Barbara","3344":"Once again severely disappointed by the service. We go here frequently because of the food. It so sad that the service degrades the service. Tonight - 11\/9\/19 - we went in for just  desert. The service was so poor we left a $20 bill on an $11 bill and left without taking the desert.","3345":"We've been back since and their service has definitely improved. One of our favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara!","3346":"I remember the first time I went to Jane at the recommendation of a friend. When I had arrived then (on a Saturday night), people were standing around the door, waiting to be seated and the restaurant was full and packed. Knowing in advance that I was going to be heading up North for a quick trip, I made sure to make reservations in advance since I knew that would ensure that I would be seated on-time on a Saturday night, and hungry. \n\nImagine to my surprise after finding street parking, that when I opened the door to the familiar space, the place was pretty empty. Gone were the busting crowds of people waiting around the door, the servers running from table to table, and the quiet to mildly loud conversations of patrons ranging from families to younger groups celebrating an event or just hanging a night out on the town. Instead, when we walked in, there were lots of empty chairs and the chairs that were filled up, were made up of couples and small families having a meal together. Servers were still busy, bartenders tending their back bar, and the cooks in the back taking orders and pushing them out of the kitchen; however, not the same imagine that I had just barely a couple years earlier.\n\nWe were seated down promptly to one of the smaller tables inside against the wall and our server came and took our orders. The menu was still the same as I remembered it, the only difference being the specials for soup & entr\u00e9e for the night. Glancing around, not much people seemed to come in after us, and the 2nd floor tables (with one stairway leading up two different sections upstairs), were also pretty vacant.\n\nRemembering that I devoured my pasta last time, I went ahead and ordered the same one again, wanting to enjoy the wonderful taste again. My friend ordered the fish & chips and we split a Caesar salad.\n\n+Caesar Salad -perfectly tossed and fresh greens. A nice flavor for the dressing and fresh to the bite.\n-Spaghetti with Meat Sauce\/Balognese - unfortunately, the sauce was too salty this time and just didn't meet the flavor I last remembered having the first time around. The pasta was also still somewhat under-cooked which didn't help with the overall taste.\n-Fish & Chips - the chips were overly fried and somewhat burnt to the ends which made them overall, very dry and hard to eat without dipping in some sauce first. The fish was fresh, but similar to the chips, overly dipped in batter and dried out.\n\nSadly, this experience left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth and next time, instead of visiting old haunting grounds that I'm familiar with, will probably choose to venture out and try the other food places around downtown SB instead.","3347":"My colleagues and I had lunch at this charming eatery in downtown Santa Barbara. The place was packed, but they were sable to squeeze us in up in the balcony. Service was very welcoming and friendly!\n\nBut they sure did take their time with getting the food out to us. And it wasn't just us... the table of 6 nearby waited just as long and made comments amongst themselves that we overheard.\n\nUnfortunately, when the food did finally arrive, we had some misses. The burgers were overdone and, therefore, quite dry. Their delicious sauces went a long way to make our dishes palatable, but let's face it... those who order burgers want juicy burgers, right?","3348":"Been coming to this restaurant for the last few years and have never been let down. I have worked my way through most of the menu and have been very satisfied with every dish.\nVeil\/chicken piccata, steamed clams, tapenade, calamari, duck, lamb everything I love done right! \nServers are prompt and very knowledgeably of the menu! Always look forward to my never visit!!","3349":"Jane fed my fiance and I real well during out short day trip up to SB. Not sure where to eat lunch, we consulted a tourist mag and saw an ad for Jane and were interested. We found it right away and were excited to try it.\n\nIt's like Jane took diner food and gave it a major upgrade. We started w\/a large plate of tempura-fried red onion rings drizzled in balsamic glaze. We finished them w\/out any remorse - well, a little remorse since entrees followed.\n\nBen F. had the El Macho burger - bc he's pretty macho. It was big and messy and tasty-looking. I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich - usually not my style but HELLO! Fried brie?! Are you kidding me? It was rich, buttery and greasy. YUM. The skinny fries that came w\/our meals were OK...nothing in comparison to everything else. The side salads were excellent as well. We couldn't finish our food of course [damn you and bless you, onion rings!] so we took our half meals home.\n\nWe had a great day in SB and this lovely, Spanish-style [what ISN'T Spanish-style in SB?] restaurant was the cherry on top. It should be a fried cherry if anything.","3350":"Have eaten here for years as my relatives have an affinity that I've never fully understood.  Tonight (6 of us celebrated a birthday) and finally we were on the same page, the food was awful.  Two of us sent our seafood dishes back as they were inedible.  Service and venue are pretty good, but certainly none of us will be back.  Interestingly, the prices have increased while the quality of food has declined, a great recipe for going under.  Lots of better options in SB, our family won't be back.  How they can serve the seafood dishes they do and actually charge what they do is amazing to me.  Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.","3351":"We stopped in the middle of the week and had a fairly nice meal. The concepts on the menu were great, but in some instances the execution was a little off. For example:\n-The brie\/apple tart appetizer: the brie was \"fried\" but came out at room temperature, and the apples were mealy.\n-Beef and chicken entrees were pretty good, but once again did not come out hot.\n-The coconut cake is awesome, the crowning jewel of the meal.\n\nWe also came at the end of the night, and our waitress was less than attentive. It took roughly 20 minutes for our waitress to get to our table (at 9 pm) and did not introduce herself\/go over specials\/seem to care at all. That being said, hostess was wonderful (took our drink order, delivered drinks, very pleasant) and the other waiter was more concerned with our table than our own waitress.\n\nIf you are used to fine dining in the big city, I am afraid that this place may be a dissapointment.","3352":"We found this gem while in SB for the w\/d. Sat outside with our puppy and had a fantastic lunch and amazing coconut cake and sundae! Don't miss it!","3353":"This place is lovely, light and easy. Little pricey for lunch but the food is incredibly fresh, prepared beautifully. We all enjoyed our meals and we all got different things. I had the trout salad, it was good- it had a French sauce on it and I was expecting more of a light lemony fish on a salad but it was good. The service was slightly slow even though the restaurant was not full, but I would definitely come back and recommend it if you want an elegant meal with beautiful atmosphere.","3354":"Jane is a very adorable Santa Barbara restaurant with amazing food, friendly staff,  and a homely atmosphere. The food has a very quality and homemade feel. My personal favorites are the grilled salmon, flat iron steak, and the chicken piccata (but every meal is quite a treat). In addition, try the goat cheese pancake appetizer if you're feeling adventurous!! Make sure to save room for dessert. Their coconut chiffon cake ranks among my favorite desserts (from anywhere). I also love their cobblers -- look out for the peach or apple cobbler. \n\nIf you are around state street in Santa Barbara and looking for somewhere to eat, I highly recommend you go to Jane. I've never had a disappointing meal at this wonderful restaurant!","3355":"Very cute sweet spot in Santa Barbara that has such a beautiful ambience. Food was great. Definitely recommend if your visiting ! \n\n\nI met Jane the owner, she was also very nice and friendly!","3356":"Simple but delicious burgers. Clam chowder soup was a bit disappointing because it was watered down. Staff were very helpful and friendly.","3357":"Great menu, great staff, lovely place. The lamb sausage is to die for.","3358":"We grabbed lunch here just passing through town on out way to LAX.  I really wanted to like it more.  The restaurant itself is cute and cozy, and our waiter was very nice.  The starters were good: butternut squash soup was tasty, although a little under seasoned.  The red rings (beer battered red onion rings with balsamic and homemade ranch for dipping) were AMAZING!!!\n\nLunch unfortunately was just ok.  I got the dungeon was crab and papaya salad, and my crab was clearly out of a can and fishy. For a $20 salad, really disappointing. Hubby's Gorgonzola chicken salad was fine, but nothing special.  Perhaps their entrees are better.  Definitely worth going to if you have an onion ring jones!!!","3359":"Best restaurant in Santa Barbara. I've been coming here with my family and friends for years now. We come in at least once a week, a lot of times twice a week and we are never disappointed. The staff has made an effort to recognize our regular visits and they always welcome us with big smiles and friendly conversation. \n\nNow the food! Nothing better. This is one of the only restaurants where I can go in, get something different every time, and leave super happy. The chicken piccata is my go to, but the steak frites, burgers, pasta, and salads are a close second. Also, somehow they have the best Diet Coke and they give you a pitcher of your drink for personal refills! \n\nCan't say anything bad about Jane. We've already got our reservation set for tonight!","3360":"Highly recommend this cozy and quaint restaurant in Santa Barbara. The ambiance is relaxed,open and romantic. \nThe service is great. What I mean by great specifically is every staff member is professional and yet has a charming personality. \nNow when it comes to the food... The portions are generous! I had the Caesar Salad, Fried Calamari and the Flat Iron Steak with a White Sangria as my drink of choice. All dishes were cooked to perfection. \nLast and not least is the desserts. \nI chose the Strawberry Swirl Sundae. This is the perfect end to the experience. Fresh and light... it wrapped up the whole dining experience with a bow. Great Job Jane and my server Renae!!!\nMight be back for New Years Eve!!!","3361":"Really good experience.  Manager totally took care of us when I told her about my son's allergies.  The waiter was also great and took care of us really well.  Would definitely recommend this place to my friends and would come back myself. Food was also really good.","3362":"Came here Friday evening with a group of 8 guests to celebrate my sister's bachelorette party. First of all, the atmosphere was incredibly warm and inviting. They sat us at a beautiful long table with gorgeous flower arrangements. Second, the staff was top notch! We were pleasantly greeted and seated right away. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and did an exceptional job making sure that everyone had a drink in hand right away. Our waitress always seemed to be at the right place at the right time! Lastly, the food was phenomenal! From the fresh bread, to the famous Chicken Piccata, to the mouth watering Coconut Cake! Everything we ordered was delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant...5 stars all the way! Thank you so much to all the staff at Jane Restaurant for making this special night so memorable!!","3363":"Great healthy dishes. I love the salads and reasonable prices!","3364":"5 stars due to the service alone. The tall male host was a bit...snooty. However, Tony is phenomenal -- we called ahead and spoke with him on the phone and when we arrived he was exceptionally courteous, hospitable, and took fantastic care of us. We'd come back just for Tony. \nReyah our server was also tremendous and very friendly and accommodating. She did a fabulous job as our server. \n\nThe food was also quite good. As good as any of the great places in SB. The lamb chops and duck were delicious. \n\nPs -- wait for the balcony seating, it's worth it.","3365":"I came here on a weekend night with a party of 7. Parking can be a bit tough as this area of SB can get packed and lively at night. The restaurant itself has two levels with very cute and romantic decor. Our party of 7 got lucky without a reservation because of a no show, but this place is popular and packed. \n\nThe service was exceptional although at first it took a while to get their attention. Our party ordered a lot of food from the menu but the standouts were the Goat Cheese Pancakes that have salmon and topped with golden caviar and the Chicken Piccata. The pancakes were so soft and fluffy and melted in my mouth. The goat cheese creaminess and flavor fused so well with the pancakes and the salty caviar was the last kick on the top to form a flavorful and unique explosion in my mouth. I would get this appetizer! It is so unique and tasty! Next, a lot of us got the Chicken Piccata. The presentation definitely looked nice. The noodles seemed a tiny bit under-cooked. However, the sauce on it was amazing. The chicken was not too thick and was very tender. The capers were very good too! Also, surprisingly, the vegetables were very good and well seasoned. (and I usually think vegetables are bland). The main standout of this dish is the chicken and the sauce. At the end, I would get some of the bread and dip it in the sauce.\n\nOverall, this is a nice place for a romantic dinner or a group celebration. The service was good and the waitresses were very nice and friendly. The food was amazing and made it a very memorable night in downtown SB with good company for me.","3366":"Janes is by far one of my favorite restaurants in CA. They have one of the best fries I ever had it's like In n out fries but better. The Jane Burger is my go to because it has a deep fried Gouda cheese oh my amazing and super flavorful!","3367":"Hands down the best meal on our vacation. I love good food and splurge when on vacation.  I always do my homework so we eat yummy food, I am so glad I picked Jane. I got the chicken piccata and my husband got the El Macho burger.  We also shared the fried apple and Brie salad, with coconut cake for dessert. We had to get the cake to go because we were too full but everything we eat was amazing. I will come back here the next time we are in town and order the exact same thing.","3368":"It's was my first time coming to this location since I always go to the one in Goleta and absolutely love it. The food and service is exceptional In Goleta, however the location In Santa Barbara does not compare. Ordered the filet mignon,which usually comes with scalloped potatoes, but they served us some type of fried potatoes that were dry and flavorless. After I told the Sever ( who was very rude about it) and the manager they said it was very busy and the cooks don't communicate to them what they are serving. I have never had that experience before because Jane is usually very busy and that's not an excuse as to why they don't serve what you order. The service was very bad and the waiter was rude ( even the manager lady) Definitely not coming back here again and it's unfortunate because I always have the best reviews about this place and recommend it to my friends and family. If anything, I'll continue going to the Goleta location. It's pretty expensive to get served something you weren't expecting.","3369":"Delicious.  Got the $16 macho burger and my wife got the kale salmon salad.  Great $7 beer and the bread was delicious. I will be back!","3370":"Our group of nine (aunts birthday) was seated at 6. It is now 8. We have not been served our food. I have not been asked if I would like another drink. It took a full hour to get bread, after we asked three times. We are actually being ignored, like, the waiters won't acknowledge is at all when we try to get their attention. I'm not a finicky man, I don't get bothered by much but I mean come on. 2 hours. No food.","3371":"It never disappoints! We come here every time we are in town! It's hard to chose only one dish, but my favorite dessert it's the coconut cake! It's delicious!","3372":"My Wife Julie and I had a wonderful dinner last night at Jane. The setting was very nice, we were given a nice, quiet table upstairs, the service was excellent (Sierra was great) and the food absolutely delicious. Julie had the Filet Mignon and I had the Petrale Sole. The whole experience was very nice and we look forward to going back!","3373":"Every time I go to Jane, I'm pleased with the classy, casual vibe. The dimly lit, cozy atmosphere is intimate without being too romantic, making it the perfect gathering spot for friends or a mid-week dinner splurge. The food is good and very reasonably priced, but the side dishes usually have a somewhat pre-prepared look and flavor (similar to what you might expect at a high-end charity event). I'm not sure if the dishes sit under heat lamps, or if they're simply prepped too far in advance, but the result detracts from what would otherwise be a delightfully designed menu of flavors. In fairness, if Jane didn't get quite so much hype as one of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara, this would probably seem less glaring, but as they say ... heavy is the head that wears the crown. Don't get me wrong, I've been to Jane three times, and I'd go back again in a heartbeat. The ambiance never disappoints and the food is good. Just not great.","3374":"The BEST dinner place and staff. We ordered a burger and pasta dish and both were amazingly delicious!! I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner and she shared with me the story behind the place. Family oriented staff that make you feel welcome and Five star food experience. I can't wait till I am back im SB to go here again for dinner. Thanks Jane staff!","3375":"Great service and yummy food! The bread basket was very fresh as well. Sitting at an outside table was perfect and we were able to hear the music playing down the street in front of the Granada.","3376":"JANE is a beautiful and intimate boutique restaurant on the upper end of State Street and is considered one of Santa Barbara's gems. It's in close proximity to the Arlington theatre and a bunch of clothing\/novelty shops.\n\nI came to JANE with my boyfriend, which is no surprise there since this restaurant is very date-worthy and romantic. I always ask for a table next to the big window in the entrance or on the upstairs balcony in the corner for the most intimate dining experience here.\n\nFOOD-\n\nWe started off with the Goat Cheese Pancakes ($12) which were delectable; it almost reminded me of a Russian dish with the use of their sour cream and golden caviar on top of their beautifully sliced smoked salmon.\n\nWe also ordered their Grilled Pasilla Chile ($12) as an appetizer, which to my knowledge was a bit soggy and under cooked, and I felt that the tomato vinaigrette could have been toned down, but the fresh cilantro that topped the swiss cheese made it an okay starter.\n\nAnother appetizer we started off with before our meal were their Firestone red onion rings ($12). Like the Grilled Pasilla Chile, the Balsamic glaze was a bit overwhelming but the onions were well battered and glistened perfectly when cut into with the spicy herb cream. I really enjoyed them!\n\nFor the main courses I decided to look on Yelp to see what previous customers hadn't reviewed yet but from also asking our lovely waiter what his recommendations were, I decided on choosing the Chicken Piccata ($23) which was served with vegetables and perfectly cooked Fettuccine glazed in white wine and capers that worked well with the chicken. \n\nMy boyfriend chose the Jane burger ($14) which to my surprise had delectable Gouda cheese and caramelized onions but on the short side of gourmet, \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn short, the food is amazing, the restaurant is in a perfect location for a beautiful sunset if you sit on the balcony, JANE honors reservations, staff is in tip-top shape, and you will have an amazing time dining here!","3377":"I had the opportunity to eat at Jane last night, prior to a concert across the street.  The menu was somewhat limited (little did we know that there was a whole other vegetarian menu -- no one mentioned), but our foursome ended up eating 3 salads (which were excellent) and a burger, which was OK.  What really got us was the \"starters\/potato skins\" for $14.  What it ended up being was the other ends of a potato with some greens and a little lox.  The ends were about a half dollar in size (there were two) and about 1\/4\" thick.  I would definitely return for the salads, but skip the skins next time.","3378":"Always happy when my girlfriend and I go to dinner at the State location or out at the marketplace. Service is always friendly and prices are amazing for the portion and quality of food. Great variety of tables (ask for a table on the upstairs balcony overlooking State if it's a warm enough day or night!) and our favorite date night location","3379":"This restaurant is amazing! Great food, great drinks, wonderful servers and decent prices.  So glad we chose this restaurant and will definitely be coming back","3380":"It was was the perfect Venue for my wedding reception and the mezzanine we reserved was beautifully set up when we arrived with our wedding party. The mood, ambiance, and service as well as food was amazing and really everyone enjoyed themselves and made comments about how amazing everything was. Matt our server was amazing and very accommodating throughout the night and we had the perfect ending to our amazing day! My husband really enjoyed our coconut wedding cake and will not stop eating it. Lol","3381":"Food: Delicious vegan options. Ask for the vegetarian menu (they don't advertise that they have one) then let your server know you're vegan. I had vegan fettuccini. I was really curious about the sauce, but confirmed it has no dairy! It was so delicious and filling. \n\nDrinks: Good selection of wine by the glass, but the menu didn't list the regions\/origin. It was a little awkward.\n\nService: Friendly, helpful, attentive and fast! Happy to answer my questions about the food.\n\nAmbiance: Uniquely small - cafe style loft seating available. Lively at dinner time, so call ahead to reserve a table.\n\nOverall, 4\/5 stars. Great food and drinks, a little awkward menu situation.","3382":"Jane, we wanted to like you.  Really.\n\nThe restaurant was half empty when we arrived for lunch on this Saturday afternoon.  Got seated at a two top.  Got to try these red onion rings.  The pictures look so good!\n\nPut in our order:\nFirestone Red Rings\nHomemade Ranch 9\n\nQueen of Reseda:\nPesto Chicken Panini\nFresh Mozzarella & Roast Peppers\nOn a Homemade Bun 12\n\nJamie V the Yelper:\nEl Macho Burger\nPasilla Chile, Jack Cheese, Avocado,\nTomato, Red Onions\n& Spicy Chipotle Mayonnaise 12\n\nBurgers and Sandwiches Served with a Choice of Soup, Salad or Fries.  I opted for the soup, clam chowder.  Q of R gets a salad.  \n\nNo sooner do we order and they seat a couple of women right next to us.  Really close.  Like pass the salt close.  Lots of open tables all around the restaurant.  One of the ladies asked the hostess if they could take a four top not so close.  No dice.  \"That's for a party of four \".  They reluctantly sat next to us.  Awkward.  No one ever took the four top table the whole time we were there.  \n\nGreat.  Now I can't use the F-word in casual conversation.  I hate sitting close to other people in restaurants.  I'd rather be stuck on a cruise with Kenny G.  http:\/\/smoothjazzbuzz.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/23\/the-kenny-g-cruise-to-alaska\/\n\nOur intimate lunch with our new friends continues...\n\nRed Rings are delivered super hot.  I wish they had half orders because it's way too much for two people.  I thought they were okay.  Q of R says too greasy.  Ate less than half.\n\nFood arrives.  Her Pesto Chicken Panini has seeded bun which she can not eat.  No seeds for the GF.  Panini with sesame seed bun?  They replace with whole wheat.  She said it had no flavor.  Salad was over dressed.  Q of R not happy.\n\nEl Macho Burger was okay.  I just didn't love it.  Should have gotten the Classic Cheese Burger.  Cooked med-rare as requested.  It's huge.  My Clam Chowder was replaced by some just okay fries.  No chowder for you Big Boy.  I should of said something but at that point I just said fug it.\n\nOur hostess was really nice as was our waitress.  Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things.  I don't know.","3383":"We went for the first time to Jane on July 16, our ten-year wedding anniversary. What a nice place!  It is comfortable and clean, with friendly staff, and excellent food. It's on the pricier end of things, especially if you order wine and dessert, like we did. Still, a great place to have a celebration!","3384":"The best coconut cake in town!  Hands down.","3385":"The waiters here are so rude. The girl w the short black hair and bangs is so disrespectful. She had attitude the whole time and wasn't able to accommodate to our requests that were simple and realistic. Will not be returning here. However the food was delic, which is unfortunate bc they need new staff. And i will be taking that flower thx.","3386":"Wonderfully delicious, fresh meals are the star of Jane!!\n\nIt can be difficult to compete with a number of eateries on a busy street packed with them like State Street here in a Santa Barbara, but Jane does it, and does it well. \n\nThough the prices may be a little higher, the food you receive is extremely high in quality. My family and I ordered the firestone red rings, the roasted chicken dinner, and a steak and cheese sandwich, and the pecan tart for dessert. My family member who ordered the steak and cheese sandwich said it was the best he's ever had. The chicken was roasted to perfection and had such delicious and perfectly cooked scalloped potatoes on the side. All very delicious. \n\nA strong note of advice and encouragement: try the firestone red rings!!  These are unlike any other onion rings I have ever had. They are made with red onions, and you actually get a mouth full of sweet onion when you bite into one, with a nice crispy exterior that has been grilled and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Underneath the mountain of rings is a small shredded lettuce salad to complement them. These red rings are SO outstandingly good!!\n\nThe reason Jane does not get top billing is the service. The hostess the night my family and I visited for the first time was not very cordial and seemed a little irritated when we asked to sit at a specific table (one that was not by the door on a rare wet, cool night, that she led us to). Our server was also not very friendly and only really did what was asked of him and not much more.  Also, Jane only offers wine and beer; it is not a full bar. \n\nOverall, Jane is a definite must-try when you are visiting Santa Barbara as it has delicious meals that leave you with the most wonderful satisfied feeling.","3387":"My daughters and I were enjoying a trip to Santa Barbara and decided to try Janes to celebrate my birthday. It is a cute restaurant with two levels. We were seated on the first floor. We ordered the Apple\nFritter and fried Brie salad as a starter and for our entrees we ordered the duck breast, two lamb chops and vegetarian bruschetta and eggplant pate salad. We ordered the apple fritter and fried Brie just because it sounded different. It was not what we expected and in my opinion lacked flavor. Our entrees however were delicious !  Both the duck and the lamb chops were cooked to perfection. We ordered a toffee carmel sundae to share. It came out with a birthday candle which was nice but the restaurant did not offer a free birthday dessert. Usually restaurants of this caliber offer a complimentary birthday dessert so that was a little disappointing.  All in all the service and food was good. For vegetarians ask for their special menu.","3388":"Wonderful, magical experience with great food at fair prices. Really good value. Great service. Post Covid, felt very safe and like they were taking everybody's health seriously. Can't wait to make it back.","3389":"Coming here was such an amazing experience!! Jane is easily my new favorite restaurant. The outdoor atmosphere was lovely and the food was incredible. Our servers, Robert and Marco, were the best!! So friendly, helpful, and super upbeat. We will absolutely be returning soon. \n\nAnd everyone is right about the coconut cake, it's delicious :)","3390":"The ambiance and service were pleasant.  We each ordered a hamburger.  And both were disappointed.  I had the Macho and it was overcooked and bland.  He has the Texas one and it was also overcooked and bland.  I've never seen my very fit boyfriend not eat an entire burger - or two.  Neither of us ate even half of the burger.\n\nThe fries were delicious but be forewarned, they add minced garlic to them and that's not mentioned on the menu.  Not a problem for most but I can't eat garlic so was unable to eat half my fries.\n\nWe thought for a moment that we may have ordered wrong - like one knows not to order a burger at a sushi joint.  But considering they had 6 different burgers on the menu, I'd say they are invested.\n\nFinally, not sure why this is listed as a wine bar.  The \"best\" wine by the glass was the Rodney Strong Pinot Noir for $11.  Disappointing considering there are so many lovely wineries in the region.","3391":"I'm a frequent diner at both Jane Restaurants (Santa Barbara and Goleta). This review is about the Santa Barbara location. The quality of the food and usually the customer service is a close exceptional match. I've frequented both locations as wonderful business meeting spot. I am very engaged with the local Santa Barbara community and in the past have recommended the Santa Barbara  restaurant. My wife is in a business where she entertains out of town guests and has also recommended Jane to her customers and collegues. Personally, my wife and I are walking distance  to the State Street location and choose to go here as one of our top local restaurants. \n\nWe will no longer entertain or recommend Jane to clients, guests or colleagues. Our recent experience shows they have little in the way of customer service or even personal respect. We had made a reservation at 5:30 tonight. We arrived 6 minutes early. We were actually unaware we arrived a few minutes earlier to their 5:30 opening. The hostess very politely explained that they were not prepared for guests yet. I appreciated her demeanor and approach. However, mid-sentence she was interrupted by a lady that likely was the manager. She asked us to leave. It was communicated in a very curt and discourteous way. She had many options on how to deal with this situation politely. She could have offered us to sit at their bar area and have drink or to wait on the bench in the reception area. Instead we were curtly asked to leave. Rudely, she put an exclamation point on her demand by loudly shutting the door on our heels and turning the lock. \n\nThere are many wonderful recommendations for restaurants in Santa Barbara and in the vicinity of Jane. Let me recommend a few. \n\nIf you want out door dining:\n\nZatoon - probably the best outdoor dining experience you'll find.\n\nLa Arcada Bistro - Beautiful Couple that will host you and outdoor dining experience.\n\nBenchmark - a nice informal dining location on State Street with a very nice menu and where we chose to go instead of returning to Jane. \n\n\nChase Bar and Grill - Amazing Customer Service, Very nice traditional indoor setting and a few outdoor tables. \n\nYoichi - Traditional Japanese restaurant - extremely intimate and delightful experience. Established by the owner\/chef, Yoichi Kawabata who came from Nobu. What a local treat!! As others will attest to -  https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details?userid=WwSg7p2hlSsIE63XsBBlAg\n\nAragato Sushi - Second favorite Sushi restaurant.. but the most traditional pure sushi restaurant.\n\nSanta Barbra has an amazing offering of restaurants. It's always our choice to where we spend our money and have an enjoyable experience we are  looking for. Jane Santa Barbara has disappointed and now is far down my list of places where I will spend time, money or recommend to others. I hope you find a favorite after your research and personal experience. Don't make Jane a first choice.","3392":"If you are going for that great and extremely well priced happy hour beer and burger special, be forewarned. The price has gone up by a few bucks(no big deal) but the quality has come down by, in my opinion, a lot more. The \"old burger\" was thick with Gouda, bacon, and yummy jammy saut\u00e9ed  onions. The \"new one\"is thin, has shredded iceberg lettuce and a few sliced tasteless tomatoes with just a hint of cheese. Gone are the bacon and onions, and by the way, so is that small dish of delicious fries that you used to get with it. The beer brand has also changed, but not being much of a beer connoisseur, I can't really talk about that. But It just didn't taste as good. And so we, that great tribe of cast out former Burger Night wanderers, with  memories of the Paradise Cafe, roam the Santa Barbara restaurant desert in search of that burger of yore.\nTruthfully, I don't expect JANE to lose money on this meal, but hey, we're all in this together.","3393":"I rang up and made a lunch booking 3 weeks in advance.  As I made the booking the girl on the other end of the phone was having a dual conversation between me and another patron.  I asked her twice to confirm the date and time I had booked for a party of 10 (a ladies group) and she obviously wasn't paying attention to me.  She said she had it and also insisted I leave my Amex details with them so they could charge $75 if my group did not turn up.  I was hesitant to do this but our group had already agreed on this particular restaurant, and as we were catching the train from LA to Santa Barbara for the day I knew everyone was turning up.\n\nA week BEFORE our booked day for lunch I noticed my Amex had been charged $75 by Jane restaurant.  I had not been informed of this by Jane's staff.  I rang up and requested the manager.  I was told I couldn't speak to the manager unless it was a very good reason!  I finally convinced them that I really did need to talk to the manager, and a very young sounding woman called Meagan who had no customer service skills talked to me.  She couldn't understand why I wanted the money refunded to my Amex and why I wanted to cancel the booking for the following week.  \"We'll just deduct the $75 when you come in\" !!!!!!!!  \n\nI am now in contact with Amex disputing the charge Jane made to my Amex and refusing to pay it.  I expect a full refund from the restaurant.\n\nJane restaurant obviously has:\n\na) customer service skills which are lacking for this calibre of restaurant\nb) a lot of customers who don't turn up (probably due to a). )\nc) a very devious way of making money from customers, charging their credit cards weeks in advance of their booking.\n\nBE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT GIVING YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU DO NOT WANT CHARGES MADE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.\n\nShame on such an establishment.  I don't think they will be open for long with this attitude as there are plenty of other high calibre and honest restaurants in Santa Barbara in competition with them.","3394":"Such an adorable restaurant!  Food\/service\/ambiance = perfect!  \n\nWalked in without reservations and was seated immediately.   I ordered the Chicken Picatta and the BF ordered the Lamb and Fries.  Our waitress was the best.  She was knowledgeable and attentive.  She even came to our table to apologize for the long wait for our food (we had been waiting less than 10 mins).  \n\nOur food was definitely worth the (short) wait.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and tender\/juicy inside.  And the sauce was delish!  The BFs lamb was perfectly cooked, medium well.\n\nThe decor was very comfy country chic!  Too adorable!  Although the place was at max capacity when we were there, it was not too loud.  A very nice place to unwind after a day of wine tasting and sightseeing.\n\nOverall, I'm back home in Long Beach and can't stop thinking about Jane.  Will definitely go back!","3395":"We ate there on New Year's Eve.  They had a wonderful pre-fixe menu.  The service was outstanding and all of the food was great.  I highly recommend this restaurant.","3396":"I LUUUV Jane.  Their chicken piccata is UHmazing.  I don't live in SB but every time I come home to visit the 'rents (~ 2-3x a year), I make sure to have lunch or dinner and get my piccata fix.  \nI did want to share my most recent experience with Jane.  I ordered over the phone two orders of the piccata for a Father's Day dinner Saturday evening.  One for Papa and one for Mama.  I, sadly couldn't partake of the deliciousness all the way here in South Carolina..  :(  Upon arriving home from picking the dinner up, my mom discovered she was missing the fettuccine from one of the meals.  She was not so happy.  As I wouldn't be either.  I called the restaurant back right away and they genuinely apologized for the error and offered to credit my account for the one meal.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I called, but this was a satisfactory outcome.  My parents shared the one fettuccine portion and had a lovely meal with a text from mom, \"Delicious.  Cheesecake was yummy too!\"  \nEven with a mess up, the meal was still well received and does not deter me from continuing being a Jane customer.  They responded appropriately and quickly and I already see the credit hit my CC.  \nThanks, Jane!","3397":"Sad to say our experience at Jane was a disappointment. This was to be our one nice meal in Santa Barbara, but we left far from satisfied.\n\nWe were seated immediately upon arriving since we had a reservation, and we soon proceeded to order the Goat Cheese Pancakes appetizer, followed by the Grilled Filet Mignon (for the wife) and the 3 Lamb Chops Special (for me).\n\nThe pancakes were decent. Overall, I thought the dish could have had more flavor\/been saltier, but it wasn't bad. I wouldn't feel the need to try this again.\n\nMy lamb chops were really, really good. They were cooked perfectly medium-rare and were well-seasoned. I had absolutely no complaints about them. The side of fries were good too. But they were out of arugula that night for the salad, and substituted them for spinach... which I didn't mind, except the dressing they used was the blandest dressing I've ever had.\n\nAs far as my wife's filet was concerned, well that's where things started to go downhill. She requested it to be cooked medium, but out came an extremely rare piece of meat. Upon notifying our server, she took it back... with no apology whatsoever. While my wife's steak was being taken care of, I let her have some of my lamb chops so she wouldn't just be sitting there watching me eat. Finally, our server returned w\/ my wife's steak, and left... again with no apology. Turns out the steak was barely cooked more to a medium-rare. Not wanting to deal with sending it back a second time, my wife started eating it anyway. To make matters worse, the steak was the most plain-tasting steak either of us ever had. There was literally no seasoning whatsoever, and it was hardly a tender piece. Poor quality and lack of seasoning made this a complete waste of my $26. The only saving grace to this dish was the scalloped potatoes.\n\nFrom the moment we requested my wife's steak to be cooked more, our server was pretty much non-existent. I don't know if it was because she sensed we were upset and she didn't want to face us anymore, but she never came by to check up on us. She would even come to the table right next to ours and then walk away as if we weren't there. We had to flag her down every time we needed something. Honestly, all I wanted was a little apology. Even workers at McDonald's apologize when an order isn't correct. You'd expect at least that much from a restaurant of this caliber, no? Am I asking for too much? I mean, yes, we wanted our steak cooked a certain way and were a little disappointed it wasn't, but we weren't crying about it. We were more let down by the absence of a simple apology. Eating my meal while my wife just sits there was not what I had envisioned when planning that dinner. Glad to know you care about your patrons.\n\nAnyhow, we both wanted dessert that night (esp the Coconut Cake that everyone talks about), but we didn't feel like staying any longer than we needed to, so we just left.\n\nNot going back.","3398":"This place used to be really good.  Things change.  1 year ago I came here and I was extremely disappointed by the lack of people working in the restaurant.  We waited over an hour for our food.  I spoke with the waitress about the long wait and she apologized and told me that she has to bus tables and wait on everyone in the room.  I felt very sorry for her and decided it was just an off night.  I just went back for the first time a couple weeks ago and the same exact thing!  They don't staff this place so the waiters and waitresses do much more than they should at the expense of the customer.  Not only that, but the prices are very high for what you get.  I got the filet mignon and it reminded me of a french restaurant's portion.  I was still hungry after I left.  My dates dinner was salmon and that portion was tiny as well.  I'm done with this place.  No more will I overpay for small portions and wait over an hour for my food!  The only reason this place didn't get a one star review is because the food actually tasted good.  Jane, you used to be really good.  Fix your restaurant before you lose it.","3399":"Got the janes burger and it was perfect and delicious!! Definitely recommend this place!","3400":"I'm embarrassed for this place. What a joke!!!  Overpriced, small portions and $15 dollar glasses of sub-average house wine. But check this out: My wife and I asked for a second basket of bread to go with our pasta and were told \"No\". WHAT?! They actually said they were not willing to give us a second basket of bread???!!!!  4 little slices of bread per basket by the way!! We'll never go to this place again. Never again!!!\n\nAnd did I say the portions were tiny and the food was average and overpriced? Oh, I did, didn't I?\n\nDon't get taken by this place!! Run away... as fast as you can!!","3401":"Fantastic dining experience! Had eaten here a few times when they opened, but hadn't been in a few years. This time it was with my wife (sans kids) last Saturday on a rare date night. The host seated us immediately for our 6:30pm reservation on the upstairs balcony overlooking State St. It was indeed chilly, but we were dressed for it and they had adequate heating; honestly the best seat in the house.\n\nInside is spacious but cozy and reminiscent of a Spanish ranch house. I can only describe the menu as \"California comfort gourmet,\" simple, but diverse and with something for everyone. From fancy burgers and fried chicken, to lamb chops, a filet, fish stew, etc. and a few specials, all reasonably priced.\n\nWe started with a couple of kir royales and flatbread with spreads. For entrees, my wife had chicken with chili and cream sauce, and I had the duck breast with cranberry and port reduction. Food came out hot and on warm plates (yay!). Everything was delicious, tender and flavorful with a nice bottle of local pinot. The potato gratin and veggie medley were more than sides slapped on a plate, they really stood on their own.\n\nDespite being out of the main dining area, service was prompt and attentive throughout, with good adherence to COVID protocols. Robert, our server, epitomized perfect service, which is unfortunately such a rarity in Santa Barbara. Timing was spot on, friendly, courteous and attentive, but never felt rushed. We finished our delightful dinner with coconut cake (so moist - my favorite since the Montecito Caf\u00e9 days), and a toffee sundae. Jane does things simply, but does it top notch. Will definitely be coming more often!","3402":"I reserved a table for 10 guests for my wedding dinner 6 weeks in advance with a promise to be seated at a particular table upstairs over looking the first floor. Called to confirm table location twice. Husband went in on our wedding day to decorate our assigned table with the owner Jane. She seemed so excited for our dinner! When we got there for dinner our table had been moved to the back room with no view by the restrooms and terminals. Jane returned my call as a result of my complaint and simply said, \"It ended up we had too many reservations last minute and so we had to move you, sorry for the mistake\" Our wedding dinner was ruined but Jane didn't care one bit with no attempt to make things right.\" Really disgusted with the management and service. Do not go here for your special occasion, they do not care even though they seem to.","3403":"Excellent staff w friendly service and safety precautions in place. \nEnjoyed a lovely early dinner in the balcony w music at 5pm. \nOrdered fried cauliflower, baja tacos and the blue wedge salad. Eveything was fresh, tasty and made w the finest ingredients. \nEnded the meal w the famous coconut cake which i initially came here for. \nHighly recommend!","3404":"This place is fantastic! Happy to find gluten-free items that are deliciously prepared. We had the Cedar Planked Salmon and Mark's Jadori Chicken with scalloped potatoes and veggies. Ordered pick up and everything was ready right on time. Highly recommend!","3405":"Second time at Jane, it was just as good as the first if not better! Very nice atmosphere, excellent friendly service and delicious food and drink. What more can you ask for. Thanks Jane!","3406":"Delicious dinners in the outdoor parklet. Lamb chops were prepared perfectly with red wine sauce. Roast chicken was moist and savory. Excellent wine pairings by the glass. Very good value.","3407":"Good wine, good food, a good experience.\n\nFood:  Had the red onion rings, brie and apple fritter salad, and 2 pastas - fettuccini with lamb sausage and linguini with clams.  \n-- The onion rings were fabulous, but they are all about the breading.  Almost no onion inside.  But the breading was crispy and tasty, with balsamic vinegar drizzled liberally over the top.  Yum!  But sure wish they would double the onion inside.  \n-- The salad was good.  We shared it and they were nice to bring it split on two plates.  The brie was a great contrast to the cool greens.  The apple was a nice sharp Granny Smith.  This salad really worked.  \n-- The fettuccini was good, but needed a little more sauce and sausage.  And it had 8 whole cloves of garlic in it.  If the garlic had been roasted, it would have been fine, but with it under done, the cloves were not edible.  \n-- The linguini had a super amount of clams.  Really, really good!. \n\nThe wine was good.  Had the Buttonwood Sauvignon Blanc and the Brander Cabernet.  Like that I can get local wines by the glass.","3408":"Hit or miss. The first time I went there I had the best salmon I have ever had perfectly baked at just the right amount of time...not too much not too little. If you over cook salmon it becomes a bit dry...which is what happened when I went back about a year later and it was dry and not tasty at all. \n\nI think I might try it again in the future.","3409":"Cute date spot. Clean and quaint. Tables fill up fast! Try to make reservations beforehand, especially if you have a large group!\n\nWhen we entered, there was no one to greet us at the door so we stood there waiting for the hostess for about 5 minutes which is a definite no-no in my book of restaurant etiquette! Hence, the 3 star (and not 4 star review). Service the whole time was also just mediocre and on the cold side. Hmph.\n\nHowever, the food made up for a lot of the blah service!\n\nFIRESTONE RED RINGS! This has got to be the BEST onion rings I have ever had in my life! SO GOOD! Even without the spicy herb cream dipping sauce, it's good just on its own. What's their secret? I have no clue. But trust me on this one and get this! Definitely not your average onion rings!\n\nHALF PAPAYA & DUNGENESS CRAB SALAD BOWL - I enjoyed this salad bowl but it was a littleeeee bit too sweet for me with the papaya and the honey lime dressing. The toasted almonds were a nice touch though! I also expected the dungeness crab to be in bigger pieces, but it was shredded up kinda like California Roll imitation crab style. :( Boo. Not what I expected. Overall, the salad was fresh and yummy but I wouldn't get it again.","3410":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for outdoor dining & had an amazing experience! Josh is a fantastic server-- he asked about our weekend and made sure we were enjoying the food. We ordered the chicken piccata and chicken fettuccine. The piccata was super tender and flavorful, but both dishes were delicious! We also were brought a candle during the meal which was a super nice touch. I highly recommend this restaurant if you'd like a nicer meal with cozy vibes.","3411":"Good food, good service, very small portion of good potato's. Cheapest thing on the plate and they always serve a tiny portion.","3412":"The place is beautiful and cozy. My friends and I sat outside and it was very nice because they had heaters. The waitress was very attentive. Even though we had a reservation we have to wait around 10 min to get a table outside because we didn't want to have dinner inside. But that was ok. In terms of the food, I feel that I ordered maybe the wrong dish (boeuf Bourguignon). I didn't read any reviews before coming (as I normally do) so I didn't know what to expect. I just saw at the entrance a letter from Julia Child recommending this place so that immediately brought me some memories of French food. So I decided to order the beef Bourguignon and a glass of San Simeon Pinot Noir. I was a bit disappointed with the beef because I felt it was lacking flavor. Others that I've tried in the past taste more like wine or herbs. But I did like the flatbread with eggplant and olives, that's great for sharing. And my friends said they really loved their dishes: chicken piccata, seared ahi and shrimp salad, and the duck. We also shared the coconut cake between the 4 of us. It was pretty good, it's soft, milky and tasty. Two of us thought that maybe having another flavor on the side (like berries) could help balance the sweetness. I think it's like a coconut version of Tres Leches. Overall it was a nice dinner and the place at night definitely felt special. I guess next time I'll read reviews to get some recommendations.","3413":"This is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Santa Barbara! Since I have now been there multiple times and have eaten almost every hamburger on the menu - I can say that this is the place for the BEST burgers in SB! Homemade buns, perfectly grilled meat patty, addictive French fries - you can't go wrong. Everything is so fresh and made in their kitchen. This location is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of State Street. Service is excellent and consistent. Bottom line is you should head up to Jane for a lovely lunch any chance you can!\n\nTheir wine selection is also fantastic and I recommend a nice bottle of wine with your lunch and then a nice, slow, enjoyable meal!","3414":"Jane has a great quiet date night type of atmosphere. I went there for a work dinner and was seated upstairs. For a date night, get a table on the balcony \/ terrace, it looked really serene!\n\nFor appetizers we got the onion rings (nice balsamic glaze on top!) and fried calamari. It was good! For dinner, I got the filet mignon, which came with an herb cream sauce and veggies and scalloped potatoes. Filet mignon was cooked perfectly! Medium rare was very tender! I loved the herb cream. The scalloped potatoes were a bit cold but not bad. My coworkers got the duck and lamb chops and it looked pretty good! \n\nOh -- get the coconut cake. It's fluffy, creamy and to die for.\n\nOverall it was a nice experience - I think I enjoyed it more than Opal next door, but Opal does have to die for scalloped potatoes! I'd come back to Jane for a date night!","3415":"Jane in Santa Barbara on a Saturday night. No reservations. Table on the veranda. Excellent Excellent Excellent! The freshest and the most delicate of an edged Baby Wedge. \nA most excellent duck breast. The finest portion of the eve was the chocolate pot with cream, coconut chiffon cake and coffee. \nA very must return to Jane is in order.\n\nThank you,\n\nR","3416":"This restaurant is near perfection.  Casually chic decor, \nbest chicken piccata ever, scrumptious desserts.....try the Jane Sunday...\nand a warm and welcoming wait staff.  \nI said near perfection.....cold dry sour  dough bread.  Skip it and save  the calories.","3417":"We went here on Friday, December 23rd for a wedding luncheon with a group of about 30 people or so.  (I forgot to count).  \n\nNo comment on value, as this was a prepaid wedding reception dinner, and I was not involved in that; however, I can comment on the overall restaurant experience, service and food.  \n\nWe were sitting up in the upstairs which has a small room and a little balcony that overlooks the main restaurant below.  \n\nOur service was outstanding and the servers and staff made every effort to make this a positive experience.  They were there whenever we needed them to be and were very polite and friendly.\n\nWe ordered from a preplanned limited menu; however, I had the Grilled Chicken Salad and Coconut Cake for dessert. Both of these were fabulous, tasty, delicious, fresh and satisfying.  I would not have changed or done anything different to these dishes. The presentation was also very positive.\n\nI would like to come back to this restaurant again, the next time I am in Santa Barbara.","3418":"What a sweet place! We were seated right away on a Friday night - even without a reservation. Our server was friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We split a delicious carafe of red wine sangria, the bread was pretty dry and stale tasting but the lamb salad was delicious! Perfect portion sizes and great prices. I would definitely go back and recommend to others. :)","3419":"Loved this charming place on State Street! Eat all the desserts -- they are phenomenal especially homemade toffee in the sundae. Enjoyed the cozy atmosphere, kind and down to earth servers, and the simple, delicious food. A solid choice for lunch or late night.","3420":"We're happy to be able to support our local restaurants again and Jane is a great local spot to come to! The chicken piccata is definitely a great choice, you can't go wrong with this entree. We had to try the famous coconut cake and it did not disappoint! I can't wait to go back again. #socialdistancedinner","3421":"Long story short: they didn't honor our reservation. A huge bummer because we drove from San Diego to Santa Barbara to celebrate our anniversary for the weekend. We had this reservation booked and when we got there the woman told us she's \"waiting for people to get up\" and then instructed us to wait outside the fence lol we watched as people got up and left, she wiped down the table, made eye contact with us, and then ignored us. I'm guessing she didn't seat us there because the table was a large table that could seat 4 people and my bf and I were just 2 people. If that's the reason, then I completely understand. However, what was the point in putting a reservation if they were going to have us waiting for nearly 20 minutes. There was also another couple that came right after us and they also had a reservation and the woman made them wait too. I think they should honor their reservation lists like other places do. We ended up going across the street to Carlitos Cafe Y Cantina and they seated us immediately, showed exceptional customer service, and the food was delicious!","3422":"We really loved our Jane experience. We were offered a seat on the balcony which was so fun to be above State St. (very rare for a restaurant around here). We ordered the shrimp scampi, fried chicken and salmon. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! Our server, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the menu and wines. He was so attentive and worked like a champ running up the stairs to make sure everyone was enjoying the evening. Five stars to Jane, this restaurant never disappoints a SB local. Thank you!","3423":"Food was pretty solid here for a fair price (especially important since everything seems overpriced in Santa Barbara). Entree prices were about $15-$30 a person. I came here for a bachelorette party dinner. They were able to seat our party for our requested time. \n\nThe ambiance was charming, cozy, and romantic. The lighting inside is perfect. Service was a little slow here, so I docked a star for that. They seemed a bit understaffed.\n\nMost of the group ordered the chicken piccata. It's actually one of my favorite Italian dishes because I really like lemon. The one at Jane is really tasty and I appreciate that it comes with a side of pasta noodles and vegetables. Even the vegetables were very good. \n\nWe ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was solid. The calamari was perfectly crispy and tasted fresh. Complimentary bread was good.\n\nWe also ordered the chocolate cake and the coconut cake. Both were really good and pretty  moist. The sauces were yummy.  If you want something lighter, I'd go for the coconut. \n\nOverall, Jane is a solid place to celebrate a special occasion and good for large groups.","3424":"Sometimes food is good and sometimes food is phenomenal, our dinner tonight was phenomenal!\nService and food were excellent.\nChicken piccata was amazing\nCoconut cake was out of this world.\nYou can not go wrong is you eat here.\nIt's not cheap but worth every penny.","3425":"Food and service is 5 star.  We were in town for our anniversary and looked up Yelp and this had great reviews now we know why.  10000% recommended.","3426":"Went to Santa Barbara for a short getaway with my husband.  Based on the reviews we made a reservation at Jane for our first night and we were not dissappointed.  Jane is a locally owned restaurant on State Street.  The  atmosphere was very comfortable and quaint and the service was very good.  They have a cute balcony upstairs if you're looking for a romantic spot.  The food was excellent and we had a very enjoyable evening.","3427":"Pretty darn good. I loved my curry chicken. It was spot on. Husband has the seafood stew in a light Thai inspired coconut broth. We each had a glass or 3 of the house sauv blanc. \n\nNo dessert today but I will say we were full. We sat upstairs on the balcony which was lively as was our waitress. The food was hot and quick! I would definitely come back here.","3428":"Delicious food, great staff, and lovely atmosphere. Intimate dining at its best!","3429":"We went to Jane for an anniversary dinner, and it was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was amazing, and we felt very safe while being there. The tables were spaced far apart, and we could tell they were keeping everything very clean. They also had heaters outside, in case we got cold. Would definitely return!","3430":"What a beautiful little date spot in the heart of Downtown Santa Barbara! The ambiance here was simply perfect! We had a RSVP for a early dinner so we got to literally pick our seat so we sat right by the window. But they also have a nice fireplace or even balcony seating if you're looking for an nice private area for your party. The service was top notch the entire night with our awesome waiter and hostess definitely giving full service! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=FNbWLCaAqciNgpZhKjgw9Q&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA\n\nThe menu is pretty much full of modern American cuisines ranging from your burgers, pasta and salads. Also checkout the daily special menu for the chef's special selections of the day. The portion side and all pretty large so be prepared for a the on-coming food coma! Don't say i didn't warn you! \n\nWe started off with the highly acclaimed Firestone Red Rings & Spicy Herb Cream. This definitely did not disappoint and was actually a very interesting take on the usual onion ring. The spicy and sweet balsamic vinegar mixture drizzled on top of the rings gave each bite another level of flavor boost along with the creamy spicy herb cream dipping sauce. This was literally a party in your mouth as each crunchy bite was quite simply \"an organism in your mouth\" lol \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=yaHM4tc5QgJhf_arir7FHg&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA\n\nOur main entree selections included:\nEl Macho Burger: Pasilla Chile, Avocado, Jack Cheese, Tomato, Red Onions & Spicy Chipotle Mayonnaise served with seasoned fries. This was another outstanding selection with the super moist angus burger kicked up a notch by the spicy chile and pepper jack and super tangy chipotle mayo. I think i literally wharfed this burger down in record time, YES it was that delicious... or maybe i was just hungry? ermo... \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=dQyNaQcFQZ1Og4FraB8RUg&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA\n\nFettuccine & Homemade Lamb Sausage Spinach, Tomatoes, Roast Garlic & Cream. This was probably the least fav dish of the night. The sauce was alittle on the dry side, although the lamb sausage was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. If you're not a garlic fan definitely skip this dish too as you literally get mouth fulls of roasted garlic cloves with each bite. Or if you're on a hot date you'd probably want to push those gloves to the side. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=kLFayL9iabqSFC6Xaridaw&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA\n\nFor dessert we had  the creme brulee. Sadly i was abit disappointed with this brulee. It was definitely alittle soft compared to the typical french cremes as if they didn't steam it long enough. Strangely it also seemed like they steamed the brulee part as it was super chewy instead of the usual hard sugary crunch you would expect. But hey it was still good, but not the best i've had...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=I1UCBT-nLdaGUG0ouqdqBA&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA","3431":"First of all how does this restaurant only have 4 stars!? That is a crime. My wife and I stumbled on this little gem walking up State street last night. I love it when you walk into a restaurant and have your mind completely blown. Everything was amazing everything. From the French Onion soup which is a pretty perfect classic example of the soup to the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. Our entrees were perfect New York steak medium rare and cedar plank salmon not over cooked like it normally is at most places.  I usually avoid chicken and fish because it is usually destroyed. And the service.not intrusive and annoying. Our server was sweet attentive and very helpful.   Jane is definitely a repeater.","3432":"Absolutely delicious. We arrived today and this is just the right local ambiance we need. Our server Melissa was superb. Margaret, the owner, came by to share some time. One place that's is one of my list of favs.","3433":"We went to Jane in Santa Barbara Monday for dinner. We made reservations which was helpful. We ordered the Kale  salad with Salmon and the Grilled chicken with chilies. The salmon was moist and the salad dressing had some lemon in it which gave the salad a great flavor. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. We have been to the Jane restaurant in Goleta and in Santa Barbara many times and the food and service are always great.","3434":"My son & I took an evening stroll last night down State.  (Masks On!).   He had a craving for their Chicken Alfredo so while walking he called in his order.  It was ready promptly when we arrived to pick up.  \n \nHe raced us home to his place (driving to fast for Mom), eager to gobble down the tasty dish and their yummy bread.  \n\nOur dog Shyne enjoyed the few bites he begged for as well  : )\n\nHere is a picture of them with full tummy's after eating.   Thank you Jane!","3435":"Great food and great wine selection.   The Miralaguna \"Drift\" Sangiovese from Los Olivos was amazing with my cheese burger and calamari.    Convenient location and friendly service.    Highly recommended.","3436":"Just had dinner with my Husband, celebrating our Anniversary. What a wonderful experience from start to finish. The hostess was the sweetest young lady. My son had made the reservations and we arrived a bit early. She accomidated us easily and we were immediately seated. The waitress was perfect, friendly, charming and professional.  She made our evening so enjoyable and so memorable.  Watching your team interact during our visit was a joy to see.  I saw lots of team work and communication and the food was delicious.  The chocolate marquise was such a treat and the sangria was so yummy.  The meals were simple and delicious. Thank you again for being part of our evening.","3437":"Cozy spot in Santa Barbara that was recommended by the Inn Keepers where we staying. \nWe started with 2 salads: \nOrganic House Salad - Organic Mixed Field Greens, Avocado, Tomato & Red Wine Vinaigrette\nBaby Iceberg Salad - Bacon, Avocado, Tomato & Blue Cheese Dressing\nBoth were good enough to order again if we were to return. \nFor an entr\u00e9e we decided on the El Macho Burger (Pasilla Chile, Avocado, Jack Cheese, Tomato, Red Onions & Spicy Chipotle Mayonnaise). It was very good. Their fries were good as well. Service was spot on. We also arrived early enough where it wasn't too busy. ENJOY!","3438":"LOVE this place. Great for lunch with friends, or co-workers. Quaint little restaurant with great food. Everything on their menu is good, though I usually get the steak salad. :)","3439":"I've been to both locations in Santa Barbara, and have thoroughly enjoyed both. I've only gotten the fettuccine and chicken, and every time I go I'm always tempted to try something new but have a hard time straying from a delicious meal. Atmosphere is great and the service is also great. I also love the pasilla chiles appetizer and the onion rings, and both are great starters for a meal.","3440":"Wonderful restaurant always- Jane and family always do an outstanding job...  Dinner tonight with friends was excellent- food was outstanding and evening was wonderful.","3441":"Are you looking for a great dining experience in Santa Barbara? I asked the same question and a friend of mine simply said, \"Jane.\" Located on State Street on the edge of downtown SB, it's somewhat easy to miss thanks to the many outdoor dining options loaded up on the sidewalks.\n\nWe had made a reservation because seating is limited due to COVID so I'd recommend those for any restaurant in downtown SB. We were quickly seated, given menus and complimentary bread. My friend is a regular (No, really. All the staff knew his name lol) and he said the linguine with clams was the move. It was unbelievable. Perfectly cooked noodles in a white wine & butter sauce with loads of in-shell clams. We went to Jane two days later and I got the penne bolognese and it was good, but not as good as the linguine. What I'm saying is, get the linguine!\n\nService was excellent. We got extra bread whenever we asked (to sop up the linguine sauce) and my water glass was never empty. They observed COVID protocols with the staff wearing masks and sanitizing tables in between diners.\n\nThere are a lot of dining options in downtown Santa Barbara so that we ate twice in three nights at Jane says how impressive it is. They checked all the boxes and I look forward to going back someday. Highly recommended!","3442":"What: Bachelorette Dinner with a party of 8\n\nEats: Firestone Red Rings and Linguine Shrimp, Clams, and Scallops\n\nTakes: Appetizer = Firestone Red Rings. The only three keywords that you need. The batter of these onion rings were just right-not bready at all. It is the balsamic that they drizzle on them that takes these rings to another level. The shrimp, clams, and scallops were originally paired with penne pasta, but I substituted that with linguine. The pasta's sauce is the kind that you want to dip your sour dough bread into and savor each drop of it. I loved the lightness of the entree. You get full, but not the food coma status.\n\nService: For a busy night and time, our waitress was attentive. We did wait a bit for refills on water and other beverages. They were able to get us seated right away (no wait time since we made reservations ahead of time).\n\nAmbiance: Cozy and romantic\n\nBottom line: Go here for your fine dining fix!","3443":"We love Jane, both locations. Excellent starters, salads, burgers, mains, drinks and dessert. Besides the delicious menu, we also enjoy the great service. From greetings from the front to exceptional service, we are always pleased. Never ever had a bad meal or experience there. They don't always have it, but when they do try a soft serve Ice Cream Sunday. That's my daughter's favorite. Jane's coconut cake is mine!","3444":"Jane is truly great. I've dined here twice and both times were *excellent*. The first time I came to Jane was to check out the ambiance and menu options for my sister's rehearsal dinner. As you might guess, the second time was for her rehearsal dinner. Jane is definitely a place to celebrate or treat yourself. \n\nJane has fresh and elegant food that is just as good to look at as it is to eat. Jane's atmosphere is charming and Jane somehow manages to cultivate an intimate environment despite it being a decently sized restaurant. Honestly, I think it's the twinkly lights, but also the fresh flowers and lighting against the darker interior\/wood. It all feels (and tastes) elegant. Food wise, Jane serves American fare with seasonal specials. The menu is concise, but everything is intentional and thought out - no menu item is over the top, but has just enough flare to make it delightful (i.e. the salmon is cooked and served on a cedar plank and is delicious!). Jane's dessert options are also great - the coconut cake being my favorite (the drizzle of vanilla syrup makes it perfectly indulgent), but the chocolate pots de creme and lemon mousse are also incredible and rich in flavor. Service is excellent - attentive and warm. \n\nJane is so lovely, and I can't wait for the next time I'm in SB to return. \n\n-----\nA couple of comments for those who might be interested in hosting an event at Jane:\n\nThere are two floors, and we reserved the second floor for my sister's rehearsal dinner. My only grievance with Jane is a miscommunication we had with our reserved area. Our agreement for the rehearsal dinner did not clearly indicate we would only have *a portion* of the second floor, and not the entire floor as we had discussed. However, the second floor does have a curtained off area which is adjacent to the restrooms (convenient - no flushes ever heard), and did indeed feel private. The floor length curtain provided the privacy we expected (albeit, less space), but the fact that there is a curtain was never said.This miscommunication was a bit frustrating as we thought we would have the entire floor. However, Jane's excellent service from start to finish, and delicious food mostly made up for this miscommunication. \n\nDepending on your party size, definitely book in advance. Jane is popular, and SB is a hot spot for celebrations, don't miss out on treating you guests, or yourself!","3445":"I came here for a birthday almost two years ago and I still think about the seared scallop salad with the butter lettuce. I remember eating the entire thing. It was so yummy! I can't wait to go back. \n\nCute downtown area, two story place, small and quaint.","3446":"We very much enjoyed a grand lunch and accompanying wine made with fresh seasonal ingredients and evident culinary skill. We ordered onion rings (Firestone red rings with homemade ranch dressing) followed by a special-of-the-day salad bowl (termed on the menu as a Seafood Salad) with shrimp, salmon, and cod. It was accompanied with our orders for glasses of McMurray Pinot Noir and Zaca Mesa Syrah. Both were excellent choices.\n\nOur waiter was informative, helpful, and had great timing, even though we dined upstairs.\n\nEnjoy!","3447":"Came here to celebrate a special occasion and was extremely pleased with everything!\n\nThe ambiance is romantic and the room has dim lighting which makes it perfect for date night or for couples!\n\nI ordered the lamb chops with fries and my friend ordered the steak.\nBoth were delicious! We also ordered sangria and a local beer and both complimented our meal well!\n\nIt is a little pricey, but considering it is located in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara, the price is slightly justified.\n\nAll in all, I would come here again!","3448":"Jane is also the name of my favorite cafe in San Francisco. It's a small business, loved by locals and has something for everyone. It evokes warm feelings in my belly: a welcoming vibe that envelops me in her arms after a long day. \n\nSanta Barbara's own is very similar to my Jane in SF. Although the big difference here is, it's a full fledged restaurant with a varied enough menu to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. I love patronizing restaurants that has a neighborhood feel and despite being smack dab on center of the action in busy State st., Jane manages that with their California influenced cuisine and amiable service. The food? all worthy!\n\nThe Firestone onion rings with balsamic glaze is a superb opener with its addicting crunchiness. The kale salad with golden raisins, sliced almonds and salty feta cheese, came split without us asking. The lamb chops were expertly prepared and accompanied with spring vegetables. My duck breast was perfectly cooked at medium rare and served with an abundant blood orange-cherry demi-glaze. Unreal! Mom's petrale sole was a delicate preparation with a lemon-herb sauce and husband did NOT share his juicy burger. (ok, I kid, I got a 'pity' bite!) I really like that Jane makes their own sesame buns AND mayo! \n\nWe cheered for the wallet friendly prices and generous portions: two things that aren't too common nowadays in SF. We left with a feeling of happiness -- maybe credited to the glasses of white sangria and beer -- but with an excellent meal such as this, I have no doubt we will be back for more. \n\nReview #2200.","3449":"Excellent dining experience. Really hoppin' evening - 8:45 Thursday night reservations outside. They have plenty of heat lamps, and a basket of blankets so you will be fine. The waiter was exactly perfect - he was helpful in laying out the way the menu works, without it feeling like he was trying to tell us how hip and cool the way they do things are, or how we should order (if this line is confusing to you, check my comments in my review for Blue Tavern Restaurant - another very good restaurant that needs to not take it's \"pedigree\" so seriously).\n\nWe ordered drinks (an Icelandic stout! - yum) and here's one suggestion - you've laid out a great menu of hand-crafted specialty drinks.....please create a couple that are virgin and put them on the menu. We've been taking the kids (now teens) out to dinner forever and it is a seriously overlooked menu item. We all feel special to be out to a fun dinner and starting with fancy drinks and are excited to order - and they get....coke. When asked, our waiter did offer that a virgin mojito might be made....but seriously - there also must be non-drinkers who would appreciate this as much as families and especially teens. Plus - you'll make more money for the amount I'm sure you can charge! 2 items....that's all I'm sayin'.\n\nAnywhoo, we order several dishes and our waiter asked if we were hungry. I appreciate this, because it's a clue, dear diners, of what you'll be getting. And yes, in fact, we were ravenous. Started with the deviled eggs - and fyi - just ask them to bring the crispy pancetta on the side if you're not a land animal eater - and they will happily do so.  I ordered the brussels sprouts - GET THESE, PEOPLE! I could have just made these my meal.  Also had the mussels. The flavors were good, but the amount of mussels was a bit small. Okay, yes, we like our mussels dish at Mua in Oakland and Plouf in San Francisco, and that's not what the focus of this restaurant is about....but still....please add more mussels. Son got the cheese board and loved the cheeses (but really - nothing out of the ordinary here).  Daughter and hubby got the caramelized cauliflower gratin and thought it decadently delicious.  They also got the oysters and they were from Virginia and HUGE. Truly - too big. Get your oysters from northern Cal next time....they won't be monsters like that!  Hubby and son had the pastrami crusted steak and loved it.\n\nThe environment and the service truly put the Lark over the top - I could see this being our regular Friday night spot if we were local. We're hatching a plan to spend more time in SB, so when we do, you can bet you'll see us back here.","3450":"It was a dark and stormy night on a Wednesday... my companions and I came to the lark to enjoy some grub. We were foreigners to this place and wanted to see what all the hype was about. The waiter messed up our seating arrangement so we kind of got screwed over, which is why the stars are so low. But... the food was fantabulous, let me tell you. The food was served in family sizes which was a nice change from what we were used to. In conclusion, the food was good and you most likely won't have the same wait we had since there were some exigent circumstances...","3451":"I came here with a group last night and it was wonderful as always.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Crispy Brussel Sprouts\n- Southern Pimento Cheese Toast\n- Roasted Delicata Squash\n-  Oysters on the Half Shell (satsuma tangerine granita, Goleta caviar lime, cilantro)\n- Grilled Yellowtail Ahi Tuna\n- Crispy Duck Confit Wings\n- Slow Cooked Beef Ribs\n-  Caramelized Diver Scallops\n- White Chocolate Brulee\n- Autumn Apple Fritters\n\nEverything was delicious but some standouts were the oysters (especially the satsuma tangerine granita), the roasted squash (which had an amazing smoky flavor), the scallops and the brulee. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were all full and happy at the end of our meal.\n\nI don't drink, so I love their mocktail offerings. I tried their Garden Cup (ruby grapefruit, rosemary, club soda) and Roadside (Sage, Meyer lemon, ginger) and both were great.","3452":"This really is as good as it gets! \n\nBeautiful scenery, very knowledgable servers, and truly amazing food. The food was incredible and I felt that it was very well priced for the quality of food\/service. \n\nWill definitely keep coming back!","3453":"My favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. Really great food, you will not regret going. It's a family style restaurant so more the merrier. Everything that they have is delicious. Talk to your waiter\/waitress if you need help.  They are all very knowledgeable about the food and what to get.","3454":"The place is fantastic! I took my girlfriend to The Lark for her birthday dinner and the experience was amazing. The food was fantastic and came out in a timely manner. The food came out hot and was very tasty! The restaurant itself was well lit and peaceful. We each ordered a couple drinks a piece and each drink had great flavor and appearance.  The service was very friendly and knowledgeable about the items on the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good place to have a nice dinner and isn't afraid to spend some money for good food.","3455":"I had a fantastic experience with the Lark and I've never even been there! I called to purchase a bottle of champagne for a dinner my friends were having that I couldn't attend; I spoke with Vern, who was super friendly, informative and helpful. He helped me decide which champagne to go with and actually ended up recommending the less expensive option, which was the perfect choice. He also presented the bottle to my friends along with a short handwritten message that I'd dictated. I was so impressed! He clearly cared more about my and my friends' experience at the Lark than making a few extra dollars. That's major. He was so sweet and was instrumental in making the dinner very special for my friends. I really appreciate that and will definitely be visiting next time I'm in CA!","3456":"Snuck into this busy busy restaurant thanks to the very cute hostess(by the way thanks )and were promptly seated.We were met by two very capable servers Mariel being the lead,well we wanted everything on the menu being that their were only three of us Mariel suggested that maybe we had a bit to much(albeit very tactfully)food ordered.So reluctantly we took her very goood advice and eliminated a few items.Sooo we widdled it down to four items Ribeye(OMG),Saffron Couscous,Hamachi Crudo w\/ gazpacho(a must have),and the (not your mamas)Corn Bread.Generally theirs a week link in the chain yah not so here ALL I MEAN ALL WERE AMAZING.And then dessert Chocolate Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Passion Fruit Ice Cream.Something Amazing for everyone.We had to share the dessert,the dishes we ordered were huge.Cant say enough about this restaurant come and enjoy.","3457":"Oh wow! The food here is amaaazing! We came here for NYE dinner and the food combined with the service made it so memorable. We ordered the bone marrow, scallops and cheesecake and each dish did not disappoint. There was always a twist on what you expected. Case in point was the cheesecake, which was deconstructed by ingredient. Don't know how to explain it but it was the best cheesecake I've had. I highly recommend this place to foodies and non foodies alike. You'll dream about it!","3458":"I have to give 5 stars because not only was the food amazing..the service was first class considering she had to deal with bunch of \"happy\" people!!! The Brussels sprouts was the best!!","3459":"We had a really good experience here.\nSince we were on a honeymoon we got a nice table and a congratulations card.\n\nThe service was good and our plate was amazing.","3460":"Very good place with two of the better dishes I've eaten. The fettuccine prosciutto is a beautiful mix of ingredients that presents favors new and old. The chicken dish is flat out the best chicken dish I have ever had in the United States or abroad. The Texas chef brings a southern take to the most delicious piece of meat there is. Truly an experience just eating this dish.","3461":"Overall, I found the Lark to be overrated and overpriced. It was a last minute decision to check out the Lark at 5pm on a Sunday evening, so we did not have reservations. We were told if we wanted a table they would not be able to sit us until 9:45pm but we were welcome to sit at the common table. We were cool with that. The vibe at the Lark makes sitting and having a meal with strangers inviting.\n\nWe started with a half dozen oysters on a half shell and the Larks Spicy Duck Wings. The oysters were good, delicately sweet oyster with an intense briny taste. The duck wings however were fantastic. Big juicy wings with a spicy sweet glaze. We wanted to follow the appetizers with a good bowl of soup; I was hoping for some great clam chowder - after all, we were in Santa Barbara right next to the beach! To our surprise, the Lark did not serve soups at all!\n\nSo we ordered our entrees. As we waited for our entrees, we had an excellent time with our new found companions at our shared table but fun only can last so long as I waited and waited for my entr\u00e9e. The first entr\u00e9e, Porchetta & Burrata, came quickly. It was very elegantly plated dish. Everyone at our table commented on how good it looked. Unfortunately, the taste was rather bland with a combination of flavors that just didn't quite jive. As I looked at the menu, I zeroed in on the 12oz Creekstone Black Angus Ribeye for 2, $58. I thought to myself 12oz of steak is not really a 2 persons size steak and $58 is quite a bit for a 12oz steak. So I asked the server and he confirmed that the steak was indeed only 12oz. He also said that the Lark's entrees were meant to be shared... as if that explained why it was \"for 2\"! Heck, why didn't they just go all out and say it was for 10?! In fact why don't they just add \"for 2\" on all their dishes! At this point, I have to admit, despite all that, I stilled ordered the steak for 2 - just for me - one. What did I get and when did I get it? The steak came a good  1\/2 hour after the Pancetta and it indeed was a 12oz steak but lots of fat and not quite as tasty as the term \"Creekstone Black Angus Ribeye\" would have you expect.\n\nNext time? Maybe just for the duck wings.","3462":"Ahh the love for The Lark!\n\nThe Lark doesn't need another review raving about how good it is - but it is deserving of one.\n\nThis is my second time returning to this restaurant - the first being shortly after it opened in 2013. The service has been consistently on point; the menu is perfectly satisfying (we wouldn't expect less being that the team originated in San Francisco); and the ambiance is always enjoyable (the urban interior just adds to the appeal).\n\nIf you've experienced The Lark and are as in love as I am, check out their other locations around the corner: Lucky Penny for cafe and pizza, Caveau Wine Bar for some tastings, and their upcoming Spanish resto set to open soon.\n\nTil next time Santa Barbara...","3463":"Best food ever! Seriously well prepared with the combination of flavors that are to die for. Amazing service. Great all around !","3464":"My favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara.  It can be hard to get a table on short notice, but the food is always great.","3465":"This was a real joy to find. Just wished we lived in Santa Barbara and could come back often. Ate early before the crush. Walked in without reservations on a Wednesday night at opening time. We were seated promptly. We had a great waitress, Jane. Truly enjoyed a share menu of the steelhead trout and squash & beets! Both were excellent. Ambience is rustic but very young and vibrant. Wine list was good with local wine and a good price mix.","3466":"I've been twice. The first time, July 2016, I would have given it a 5. The second time, December 2016, I would only give a 3, hence the averaged 4. \n\nThe first time there were two of us and since we weren't sure of the amount of food needed, we ordered dishes slowly, at the advice of our server. The dishes came one at a time with plenty of time to enjoy them. \n\nThe second time we invited another couple. With no direction from our server, and since we had been here once before, we went ahead and ordered 5 dishes at the outset. Big mistake. The first dish came quickly (the Brussel Sprouts which were amazing), and soon after the second dish arrived. We hadn't yet been served the bottle of wine we had ordered. Then the 3rd dish arrived, also shortly followed by the 4th. Often we were asked if we wanted a dish cleared when there was still some food on it. We felt VERY rushed. Not clear why. It was a Thursday night and no one waiting that we could see. \n\nLastly, the menu lacked sufficient information. For example, we ordered the scallop platter which turned out to have only 3 scallops on it (and there were 4 of us) with a mushroom that masqueraded as a scallop that my husband ended up with. The menu, or our server, should have informed us about the odd number of scallops, or offered to add a 4th even if at a cost.\n\nWord to the wise. Order slowly so they can't rush you. The food is deserving of that.","3467":"Wonderful and inventive menu. Our dinner was one of the best we've had in Southern California. The duck liver and waffles, the Yellowtail crudo were outstanding. We ended the night with a beautiful Meyer lemon tart.","3468":"Living in Santa Barbara 9 years, but one that enjoys the big cities, this restaurant is a great getaway in our own city.  It fits extremely well in the Funk Zone.  \n\nThe ambiance had me feeling as if I walked into a restaurant in Manhattan.  \n\nThe food was excellent.  The drinks are clean and complement the food well.  \n\nI've been now twice and both times have been happy I went.  \n\nIt is full of locals, high energy, and serves well for popping by for a drink around the big wood table or making a reservation a week out and dining for a special evening.","3469":"Went for the first time last night. Absolutely fantastic! Beautiful restaurant and I mean breathtakingly gorgeous. Started off by being greeted by a fabulous hostess named \"Jazz\" she was truly a gem. The food was AMAZING. My favorite was the roasted chicken. The service provided by Talia was perfection! Perfectly attentive and extremely knowledgeable with the menu. Will be back!!!","3470":"Great ambiance, we sat on the patio and had the heat turned on half way through. We were advised it would be best to order everything we wanted and the chef and server would coordinate bringing out our dishes..... that worked out nicely! Everything is served family style so it's nice for all to try the same dishes together! Oh make sure to rsvp it gets really busy! My favorite dishes were the trout (tender and flaky with a crispy skin) and the banana dessert (sounds underwhemimg, but a delightful surprise of deliciousness)! Overall excellent experience... great food, wonderful atmosphere and crowd,  good service as well!","3471":"Excellent food and excellent service.  Tim our server was amazing!  The Spanish octopus Wes amazingly tender and tasty.  The wine selection was excellent.  We were sat at a table where we could watch the kitchen staff work their magic.  This is something we love to watch.  Wonder if the have a chef's table in the kitchen?  That would be amazing! A great way to celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary!  We will return!","3472":"Really liked the ambience of this place. The food was delicious too. The concept of communal table was new to me. It is a good way to meet people. I would not come here after 9:30-10 as a couple in which case communal table would be the only option to sit at. Liked the fire outside.","3473":"I really enjoyed the industrial decor with the brick walls, concrete floor, exposed ceiling framing, etc. It fits the area well. I felt the food was a little pricy for what showed up on my table. I ordered the scallops with the sauce on the side so I could actually taste my dinner before potentially smothering it for any added taste. I received three salty scallops for $30.00. The dessert was delicious however and so was the Fortaleza Reposado.  I would recommend you stop bye if you are in the area. I will give it another go next time I get the chance. By the way the server was great.  Service was 5 stars and the food made it 4 stars.","3474":"I don't know if it was an off night, but service was terrible. The waitress came back after leaving an appropriate tip for the slow service and subpar food and actually had the audacity to ask why we tipped so low. She tried to \"make things better\" by not charging for drinks. I was very disappointed with the quality of service, the tasteless food, and the approach of the waitress.","3475":"We went around 5:30pm on a Friday bc we were with our dog (pet friendly patio!) The service was impressive and very quick with our food and drinks! \nThe chicken is AMAZING and is a very large portion. I would get that again!","3476":"The Lark is a modern twist on the rustic. It's a farm to table sort of concept and it's earthy feeling because of all the wooden decor. It has a supercool charm with a gorgeous patio, warm lights, and cute little succulents that live in the walls vertically outside. It's really this setting that makes an impression on me more than the food.\n\nI've eaten here a few times and the dishes have been hit or miss. As the foods are innovative and change quite often, I find not every ingredient in every dish syncs together all that well. Like the popcorn with many seasonings or the oysters with horseradish. It's fun to try novel combinations though. \n\nIf you want to try something you can't get anywhere else, I recommend an octopus dish. The octopus with fingerling potatoes and pineapple actually paired pretty well together, but the octopus was unlike any I've ever tried in that it was so soft it lacked any chew and had less octopus flavor. My boyfriend said if the menu didn't state it, he wouldn't have known what the meat was. I think it was cooked via the sous-vide method, in a plastic bag under water for a long time. A strange dish, but still my favorite so far.\n\nI have to say, everyone keeps raving about the Brussels sprouts, but when I had them they were extremely oily and too charred. Not on the menu is also a burger, which you can order even if you aren't sitting at the bar. It was no bueno though, had some weird sauce.\n\nLastly, try to get a reservation if you're going to go here because it's always packed. Even when I had a birthday reservation, we still waited twenty minutes past the hour expected. They were kind about it though, and the birthday card and complimentary dessert of choice were nice touches.","3477":"Decided to try The Lark for dinner and wasn't disappointed.  The menu is very unique which sometimes isn't good but for us it turned out to be really amazing food. We ordered a wedge salad and the 'The Garden Of' Salanova Salad between the two of us. Both salads had great flavor and were different than any other salad I've had.  For our meal we had the ribs which were tender and had great flavor. The star of the night was the hand cut pappardelle pasta dish. Never tasted anything like it. \n\nService was also prompt and friendly. Only complaint would be that the tables were really close to each other. It was a bit uncomfortable.  The food was so good I think we'd just ask for a different table the next time we come in.","3478":"Took a large party here on Friday night.  They customized the menu (including vegan & vegetarian) and made it a perfect event.  The food was absolutely outstanding!  Our server Matt was amazing - even handled individual checks for the cocktails - wow!","3479":"Tasty food - bummed we only got to try a couple dishes but service was absolutely top notch and excellent food I would say the steak dish was sliiightly under seasoned but still very good will go back","3480":"EAT EVERYTHING!!!!  \n\nMust try* the bussel sprout are outta this world","3481":"Three times we have attempted to make reservations and each time we are the options of 5 p.m. or after 9 p.m.  In between these attempts, we have stopped by at 5:45 and after 8 pm on separate days (one on a Friday and one on a Saturday), no tables were available but the communal table we were told we could sit at if there was an opening.  Please keep in mind while we were walking up to the restaurant, we saw about 10 tables available.  We waited about 20 minutes, no tables were filled and the communal table had no openings.  On the other time we came, we walked around the restaurant to see how many tables were available and there were several tables available on all sides of the restaurant and again were told there were no tables available but we could sit at the communal table.  We waited another 20 minutes and decided to walked the area for almost an hour and came back only to find a bunch of tables still empty.  We went up to the hostess and ask for a table and received the same answer.  This is the 3rd restaurant in Santa Barbara that we have seen do this, meaning not accept reservations but have tables sitting empty for over an hour.  That is money lost and bad business to hold a table for over an hour.  Were the tables really filled?  Is the restaurant just trying to play \"hard to get\".  We will give it one more try on our next business trip there and we will see if we will get the chance to try it.","3482":"Tuesday night dinner, was seated without a reservation, great food and service!","3483":"Our dinner was outright phenomenal! My mom in law said it was probably the best meal she's ever had. They serve the meal family style and coursed out just perfectly. They use all local, seasonal produce allowing for fresh and new seasonal menu changes. They source meat from local ranches. \n\nOur meal: for 4 of us. \n1. non-traditional style wedge salad made with baby gem lettuce, blue cheese, thick cut bacon, and candied pecans. Delish!\n2. Beet & Burrata salad - golden beets, pink beets, purple beets, 3 pieces of burrata, micro greens - this salad was huge. \n3. Pineapple & habanero glazed Octopus - they marinate it over night so they octopus was sooo tender! Not chewy how you typically get it elsewhere. Greek yogurt cucumber mint sauce(i think) on the bottom of the dish was refreshing, served w saut\u00e9ed zucchini, squash, & eggplant. \n4. Farro Rissoto - I couldn't eat this bc I have celiac disease, but the fam said it was the best Rissoto they've had. Great presentation on a wood plank. \n5. 12oz Prime Ribeye served with Yukon gold potato pur\u00e9e. - we had it med-rare. This dish was so phenomenal, the meat was so flavorful & tender! \n\nServer was prompt and knowledgable, awesome hostess got us a table magically even though they were completely booked w reservations. I also loved the seasoned popcorn they serve to start (instead of chips or bread) - nice touch. Vibe is super hip, place was packed (duh Saturday night), decor is rustic chic, and they make the best craft cocktails!! Thank you Lark for tantalizing my taste buds & for providing a wonderful experience for the in laws!","3484":"This food is served family style and I'm so glad. It let us try so many amazing flavors! \n\nWe ordered something from each section of the menu. \n\nFrom the snacks section: Had to try he Brussels sprouts (a house favorite - squeeze those lime wedges!) and the fried green tomatoes. So good! \n\nFrom the garden section we ordered the beets and butternut squash, which comes with warm apples drizzled in calvados caramel liqueur with sprinkled black candied walnuts. The plate presentation was so beautiful that we didn't know where to tear in! Amazing flavors! \n\nFrom the farm section: We shared the hangar steak. OMG the flavors! That sauce! It was broccoli, medium rare thinly sliced hangar steak with grilled red peppers and crispy fried onions. Sooooo delicious. \n\nNeedless to say we have no room left for dessert. \n\nMadeleine was an absolute treat. We loved her. We'll be back. \n\nThe \"Old Aztec\" drink was delicious. It's The Lark's version of an Old Fashioned. Yum!","3485":"Obviously these people know what they're doing and have created a wonderful place to enjoy a relaxing dinner of some of the best food prepared in San Diego. We had the whole roast chicken (for two) and every bite was a juicy morsel of meat with a beautiful crispy bbq skin. The raw pea tendrils made the dish complete with their sweet greenness. The half charcuterie tray with two meats and some other things was good but wasn't the best that we've had. We would recommend this place and even though we reserved at 6pm on a Saturday, it was jam packed and very lively and loud already. Kind of a very inviting environment and not a typical fine dining establishment, but has a nice rustic mismatched silverware kind of charm. One of us sat in the French confessional seat which was kind of cramped but where else can you have dinner where penitent Catholics bared their sins to their priest?\n\nOnly about three draft beers but good ones. The cocktail I had with vodka and ginger ale was pretty nice and sweet.","3486":"Nice cocktails, nice vibe and food is good but portions small and you are almost told what and how much to order by the young trendy waiting staff.","3487":"I arrived at 9:30 and the bartenders rudely and arrogantly gave me a the \"snacks\" menu  without even explaining that the kitchen had closed.  I asked for the full menu and they finally explained that they closed the kitchen whenever the last reservation got sat.   Place was full and the kitchen was still cooking but they couldn't be convinced allow me to order off the full menu.   \n\nThey need to read a couple books on hospitality.","3488":"As I sit at the Lark as their very first customer I am excited to be the first to review as well.   \n\nTonight's menu is limited as this is a limited opening but the choices look awesome!!!!    We are having both appetizers a Panzanella salad and all three of the entrees!     So excited!    Why five stars when the food hasn't even arrived yet?  Because I am SO happy to be here, so excited to be here the first night and enjoying my Modoro Margarita a whole lot...\n\n...OK so for dinner we had the Scallops the Burgers and the Fish!   Enjoyed the scallops and the burger was amazing!!! If you get it have the pork belly marmalaide with it as well!    The fish was good but we liked the other entrees so much more.  Oh and the desserts!   Absolutely amazing!!","3489":"If you are looking for good value for your hard-earned money, The Lark is the best place to be in Santa Barbara. This town has a lot of restaurants that charge the SB zip-code premium (if you know what I mean). Not this place. It is not cheap but the food is fantastic (seasonal, tasty, fresh, well prepared), the service is great (friendly, helpful, knowledgeable) and they don't make you feel like you have to leave once you started the last quarter of your plate (I was at places where they literally asked us for desert with the check in their hands right after they served us the main course). Bottom line: There are just a few places in town that offer such good food\/service for a reasonable price and The Lark is one of them.","3490":"First off, I'd like to start by saying I really wanted to love this place. I love the area it's in, the menu is great, the vibe is super cool. However, the service we got while here for dinner really bummed us out. \n\nOur server was kind of high strung from the get go, but what really got me was that she wouldn't let me order what I wanted. I was ordering a full chicken and she said, \"oh you guys have a lot of food ordered, you should just get the half chicken\". I told her no it's ok I'll get the full chicken and if I can't finish it I'll take home the leftovers.  I don't eat any grains or starches so the amount of food  I end up ordering is usually a lot more than typical when eating out since most places base their dish around something starchy.  So, then she was reading back our order she still had the order as a half chicken, which launched us into a 5 minute back and forth about it, where I was adamant about getting a full chicken.  \n\nBut she wouldn't let it go and I finally agreed to getting the half chicken.  When our food finally came out(way late by the way), my wifes piece of fish was not only not well done like she had asked for, but it was also like a tiny piece and the amount of food that we ordered was really not that much. In the end, I ate all the food that was brought and definitely would have been able to eat the whole chicken.  I ended up having to grab some mixed nuts at a store on the way home for a snack since I was still hungry after leaving.\n\nOn the bright side, the brussel sprouts were probably the best I've ever had and even with the bad service experience I'd probably go back just to try those again.","3491":"Service was great but food was a disappointment. Brussel sprout tasted like they were burnt, the shrimp main course had very little shrimp and the same could be said for the chicken main course. We ordered 3 main courses for the table and there were too many different spices on each dish.  We do not feel that the food was as good as many of the other top rated restaurants in Santa Barbara that we frequent.","3492":"Great and inventive food. Great atmosphere. I try to go every time I'm in Santa Barbara.","3493":"Amazing food and service. Nikko was as friendly and helpful as could be. We shared the pork sliders (fantastic), smoked salmon (unbelievable), kale salad (flavorful), chicken (incredible). Every dish was complex and unique. We loved everything about The Lark.","3494":"We did a 9 day California road trip and this was our favorite meal by far! Simply delicious. The food is made with such care and is so fresh. The service was wonderful and they went above and beyond to make us feel special for our babymoon. Complete with a card and mocktail \/ champagne toast. The staff were wonderful and truly cared that you had a great experience. The atmosphere is also great!","3495":"Amazing service. Amazing servers. Amazing bar with communal table. Amazing drinks. Amazing food. \n\nWe were here last night. The experience was second to none. Wife and I enjoyed some whiskey concoctions at the bar. Can't remember the name of the cocktail as we had had a few at a few bars up the street. But dinner, man oh man. Brussels sprouts. The parpadelle pasta with mushrooms and fresh peas. Large serving of pasta. Best pasta dish I've had in the last few years. Prawns prawns prawns and grits. Did I say PRAWNS!!!! get it. Order it now. Eat the heads. Suck that juice out and savor the freshness. I'm salivating as I'm typing this.  \n\nGo to the lark. Uber there. Enjoy the bar area and popcorn. Get your table. Trust your server. You won't regret it.","3496":"Wasn't that impressed. Last year we came here and had a much better experience. Food was not well described and didn't think it was all that good. Would not come back here","3497":"Visiting from Chicago where we have  a few decent restaurants and having read great reviews about The Lark, our experience surpassed expectations. Every dish was unique and delicious. Brussel sprouts are everywhere but these had a glaze of soy, sesame and other Asian influences making them perhaps the best I've ever had. The Little Gem \"wedge\" was the best dish of the night and I don't get excited about salads.  Every bite had a surprise.  Pork belly with a fantastic blackberry glaze and some sort of nut brittle was one of the best versions I've had. We fInished with a Texas Gulf Red Fish.  Crispy skin, Andouille sausage, crispy rice. Simply amazing. This chef is going places. Great service and Interesting wine list too.","3498":"Delicious meal, great service, excellent ambiance!  Jess is the best!  :)","3499":"Wow another amazing meal in Santa Barbara!  My boyfriend wanted to come here after reading a bunch of reviews and saying it was the \"it\" restaurant in Santa Barbara.  Upon arriving, I kept thinking how beautiful and cute the space was and was very happy to be seated outdoors under the night sky. \n\nThe food was delicious!  Everything is family portioned out and the plates were pretty big so be sure to come hungry.  We got the cheese board, himachi crudo, tagliatelle and pan roasted chicken.  Everything, including the bacon and black pepper popcorn that kicked the meal off was phenomenal!\n\nService was great although the food came out pretty slow and one at a time.\n\nWill definitely come back!","3500":"I've been 3 times now and have to say that I will not return.\nInitially I liked the atmosphere and young, energetic staff...it feels like Northern CA which I love. But the food has been hit and miss, mostly miss. And this last time was a special dinner for a guest I'd been hosting in my home on his last night in our country.\nOur food was submerged in sodium even though we asked to hold the salt. I don't mind pricey but please be worth it. I'm sticking with Lucky's and Olio or Opal for great consistent food. PS Les Marchand, the wine bar in back is great, just eat first, somewhere else.","3501":"I had a wedding reception in the Pullman room last weekend. The staff was extremely kind, friendly and very helpful. I was very impressed by the food. I'm still thinking about the food today. It was honestly the top 5 (if not the top 3) best wedding reception food I've ever had and I'm really trying not to be biased. The private room was perfect for 54 guests (including kids). They were very accommodating and let us decorate the room 2 hours before the reception. We all had a blast. They made my day very special and unforgettable :)","3502":"Super fun and adorable place! My mom and I were stopping through on our way to San Diego and were recommended this spot. You can bring a dog if you sit out on the patio which is awesome too. The food is super fun and unique with lots of healthy options. Great service and decor both inside and out!","3503":"This place is fantastic and the design is worth the trip.  The service experience does not live up to the food and ambiance experience -- I've dined there three times and experienced this each time.   They serve you popcorn instead of bread which may have changed but is a little strange.  Overall, it's still one of the best restaurants in SB with an inventive menu and so great to be in the Funk Zone!","3504":"Everything we ordered was delicious: Brussels sprouts, beef cheeks, Arctic char, duck confit, grilled octopus, and the ice cream cookie sandwich. The cocktails were excellent, I took a picture so I can reverse engineer and make at home.","3505":"As I always say - it's either 1 star, or 5! I won't review it if it's in the middle! :) This place was 5 stars all the way - we went for a birthday celebration and all the hype I saw online about this place was spot on. The place is beautiful, the food was OUTSTANDING, the service top notch and I can't wait to go back again! They have a winner here - try it out next time you're in that area...!","3506":"The food is overwhelmingly delicious. So decadent and rich. I appreciated the communal table and the opportunity it afforded my friends and I to dine here. My only caveat with this place is the company. We were seated next to a judgmental diner who proceeded to lecture us on our choices which we promptly disregarded. And then at the end of our meal we watched as a man tried to weasel two seats from an unsuspecting birthday girl and her party. Not the classiest behavior observed from patrons in this upscale establishment.","3507":"Fabulous food especially the crudo. Dessert was wonderful. Loved sitting at the communal high table. Had some tawny port with dessert.","3508":"My husband surprised me with reservations for my birthday dinner here! We were in town for only 2 days and I knew that The Lark was known for its great atmosphere and food. We got seated outside on the patio (as requested) near a heater which was perfect! When we arrived they had a postcard with a happy birthday note to me! Our waitress was wonderful and super attentive to us! We ordered the crispy Brussel sprouts to start which were amazing and then followed them with the steak entree. Portions are large so we split! Just as we asked for our check they brought us out a dessert with candle in it and a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate! \n\nWe had an amazing night thanks to The Lark. I would highly recommend! We will be back!","3509":"I liked it. Food was good with a nice presentation. Service was friendly and active. The terrace is a great spot for nice, hot summer night. I will go back.","3510":"My wife and I are still buzzing over our dinner and the amazing service that we received at The Lark last night.\nI booked our reservation for our 10th Wedding Anniversary through Open Table,  and had indicated that it was a special evening. Upon our arrival we had a card waiting for us at our table wishing us a Happy Anniversary and were instantly served two glasses of Prosecco. Our server Lauren was top notch, guiding us through our various food selections and pairings and when she was with other tables there were plenty other staff members who stopped by to make sure that our needs we're being met. \nThe chef's pairing of foods, textures, and favors were incredible! Each dish had an amazing depth of flavors and the desserts were off the charts.\nWe honeymooned in Paris and had some amazing culinary experiences there, and I can truly say that The Lark held its own against The Continent!\nCongrats to the whole Lark Team for providing a world class culinary experience.","3511":"My husband and I had dinner at The Lark last night.  Love the urban feel and decor.  The food is presented like pieces of finely crafted artwork.  There for you to savor with all of your senses--the pork belly was RIDICULOUS!   And if you normally skip the chicken in favor of more adventure, don't do it here!  Best roasted chicken EVER--polenta with raw jalapenos--gravy was masterful!  SO yummy.  Go. Just Go.","3512":"I have eaten at some amazing restaurants in my lifetime. Our experience was phenomenal-from start to finish. Our server, Mathew, was exceptional and The food was beyond my expectations. Highly recommend the brussels sprouts and the pork belly!","3513":"Really liked the meal we had at the lark.  They mentioned that the dishes are share plates, but they are HUGE for share plate.  Some of my favorites were the brussell sprouts, the beet pasta, and the grilled octopus with grapefruit and cauliflower.  Each dish is balanced and fresh.  Really nice cocktails as well.  Has a sort of modern, beachy farm to table theme going on.  Whatever it is, it is working!!","3514":"Not as expected. Thought it was going to be amazing experience.  Brussels sprouts bland, limp and sour.  Chickpea tagine basically chickpeas with spices.  Nothing exceptional. Gnocchi was delicious.  Overall disappointed.","3515":"Wow. I don't even know where to begin. #1 - they changed the menu.  All those pictures are of dishes that are no longer exist.  Everything we ordered was lackluster and overpriced.  Very surprised and disappointed given the reviews here. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have a cute ambience (minus the 45 degree drafts from open doors).  The best dish out of the 6 we ordered were the Brussels sprouts.  Their best dish was a vegetable side - enough said.","3516":"A true experience!  The food,  presentation, and service was beyond!  Don't miss the pimento cheese app. You can't miss with anything on the menu!","3517":"My husband and I had dinner there last night with another couple. We started with cocktails and the \n-Green Pea Hummus. Then moved on to..\n-Pastrami Seasoned Roasted Cabbage, \n-Cauliflower with Israel Couscous, \n-Caramelized Broccolini, \n-Scallops with Risotto, \n-Ribs with Ginger bbq sauce, all of the dishes were absolutely delicious. We finished by sharing a couple of desserts and some coffee. \nThe service was excellent and just what we expected.  Yes it is pricey but we didn't mind paying for such great good and a wonderful experience.","3518":"Great bar area, food is good but not great. A little pretentious. Awesome location and decor.","3519":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant by chance while enjoying a weekend up the coast.  The place was packed and we opted to sit at the communal table, which actually ended up being a fun experience. The restaurant had great decor and an inviting ambiance; it reminded me somewhat of an upscale, modern lodge resort. \n\nHere's what we ordered (mind you, we were starved!):\n-Deviled eggs (Delish!)\n-Crispy Brussel Sprouts- Lemony, fish sauce taste, and perfectly crisp without tasting overly charred\n-Santa Ynez Valley Organic Lettuces- The mixture of crab and pistachio pleasantly surprised me. I thought the salad was dressed a little too heavily with the vinaigrette, but that may just be a personal preference on my part.\n-Duck Liver Mousse- My boyfriend was in heaven!\n-Herb Roasted Diver Scallops- Perfect, rich, and complex dish!\n-Lemon tart for dessert- The poppy seed meringue was perfect with the light lemon custard, topped with blueberries... So good!\n\nOverall, great experience. The staff was efficient and friendly. We loved how the servers explained in detail each dish they brought out. And even with the restaurant so busy, we were never really left waiting. We will definitely be coming here again on our next visit!","3520":"This place is a 3 star place at its best (with a 1 star bonus for the ambience)z Coming from Norcal where thousands of restaurants compete to stay in business, I'm throughly disappointed by the quality of this over-hyped restaurant.\n\nPopcorn is probably is most satisfactory dish here. It carries a unique blend of of lime and olive oil that makes you keep eating more and more.\n\nBONUS STAR:\n- They didn't have kids menu but offered to order pizza and pasta from another restaurant, was was very kind and accommodating of them. \n- Cute interior designs with a well decorated full bar. Limited cocktail options though.\n\nWell, it went downhill from there. \n\nThings that are ok:\n- Oysters: fresh, but hey, it's raw oysters. You can't go wrong with it.\n- Charcuterie is not bad.\n- Free range chicken was pretty good. Took 25 minutes but it came out tender and juicy. We ordered half chicken but it was big enough to feed 3 adults.\n\nStay away:\n- Brussel sprouts. Was so salty that we had to send back!\n- Gnocchi. Nah.\n- Yellowtail Hamachi. The fish didn't taste very fresh and the avocado spread kinda ruined it.\n \nService was a hit and miss. Our server was great - he knows the menu very well (though we didn't like any of his recommendations LOL #sorrynotsorry). Aside from him, others were mostly rude and unresponsive. Some even took our plates away even though we were not finished eating.\n\nThis experience made me lose more trust in Yelp reviews. 4.5 stars? Man. Save your money and go somewhere else. Not coming back.","3521":"Totally worth all the hype. A great spot for a special date night or a group birthday\/celebration. The bone marrow biscuits and pork shank are really good!","3522":"I really wanted to like this place, but I just could not.  The ambiance was good but that's about it.  The food was sub-par in all aspects and way overpriced.  Ordered the jumbo shrimp, and got 6 little size prawns and a few tiny clams....for $36, you've got to be kidding me.  Had the brussel sprouts for appetizer, was also sub-par....too sweet\/over-sauced.  Also had the chocolate cake...it was all over the place and was bad too....it was like a cheap sponge-cake.  The guests sitting next to us had the octopus and stated it was bad.  I've been to many restaurants and this is one of the worst I have been to in terms of food quality.  Not sure what all the hype is about.  What really topped it off for us (and that's why I gave it 1 star ) was that my wife got sick after the meal and had diarreha.  Nevertheless, I shall never return.","3523":"Great local farm to table. Super high quality ingredients from the local farmers market. I actually saw the peppers on my plate at the farmers market a few days before. The menu is constantly changing, which shows the chef is creative and working with mother nature to bring you what's fresh and in season. All the flavors are so fresh and clean and classic, but the dishes are inventive. Service was excellent. Would highly recommend you visit the Lark in Santa Barbara. If visiting on a weekend I would recommend a reservation.","3524":"Great surroundings but foods are not that good as expected. Maybe cuz waiting a week to reserve and having high expectation on it made me a little bit disappointed. Overall it's good. The sauce in oysters I really like the apple flavor and lemon. Duck liver. Personally, Ribs, Crispy Brussels, Tomato salad with plums and Caramelized scallops are too salty that made me trunk almost three cups of tea.","3525":"Great food, terrific ambiance, friendly staff and amazing free popcorn seasoned with onion\/garlic\/paprika\/sugar. And they keep bringing you as much as you can handle. The brussel sprouts are amazing and enough for two vegans to share but if you're really hungry and don't eat meat you will want your own order haha.","3526":"Who wouldn't love The Lark. Fun place with amazing food, different dining experience than what you can normally find in SB. Reservations are a must, don't even try to show up without one right now. Request outside seating so you can enjoy the year round beautiful SB weather. The cocktails are well thought and refreshing. The food, particularly the dinner menu is delish. Our table ordered the hanger steak, gnocchi, and grilled octopus. I honestly couldn't pick a favorite as they all were outstanding. We also ordered deviled eggs as an appetizer....they were okay, but looked better on the menu than they tasted. I prefer Finch and Fork's deviled eggs. We also enjoyed our brunch during Easter weekend, which happened to be the first time The Lark served brunch. It was very good, but not quite on par with their dinner. Will definitely try brunch there again as they probably have perfected the brunch menu and dishes since then. Overall, I love this place and take all my friends here who visit from out of town.","3527":"Really Really Really Good! \n\nI've lived in SB for 20 years and this is one of the best restaurants to hit town in a long time. They have really nailed the pulse of what people in SB yearn for with a restaurant. Ambience, character, service, great food are a few of the attributes that make this such the bustling hub that it has become.\nI will be a repeat customer of the Lark and will be telling my friends and clients about this spot, also super easy to make a reservation on 'Open Table\"\nGood Luck Lark...!","3528":"We cook for a living, and this was hands-down the finest meal we had in SB. Can't wait to come back!","3529":"Every time I visit Santa B, the Lark is  always reserved for dinner. Best for a group of 4-6.  Delicious food, good for sharing. Great cocktails! Outdoor dinning is recommended.  And yes, $$$, but worth it.  Reservations are essential, and parking is tough in this area.  Use the valet\nif you aren't up for walking for 4-6 blocks.  We walk as a nice way to end an evening of dining and drinking!","3530":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. Called in advance for a party of 4 at around 6pm but was told to reserve for 8:45pm, and so we did. When we were on our way, the restaurant called us and wanted to confirm our reservation; however, it was one of the female waitresses who had called. She asked if we were on our way and I confirmed. Upon arrival, I asked the waitress in front about my reservation, and to my surprise it was not on the list! I calmly asked the waitress about the situation and kindly asked if there were any tables open. It was surprising how she treated us differently than the other customers. Might I add that it was predominantly white and out of nowhere there is a party of four Asians that seemed out of place. It was apparent that the waitresses were being racist and \"looked down on us\" just because we are Asian. After 40 minutes of waiting and watching table after table seating those that came later than us, we decided to leave. It was extremely disappointing and vexing how we went all the way to Santa Barbara from San Francisco just to try this restaurant and instead we were just not welcomed. Truly disappointed that we did not try and will probably never try the food there, but it is fine there are other restaurants that are not racist and have a better sense of integrity towards customers.","3531":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and wanted to give it a try.

Food is original and tastes great. We had the roasted Brussel sprouts with figs, loved it! The octopus was ok, it was cold and I did  not like that. The tuna hamachi was very good and I would recommend it (think sashimi). Finally the rack of lamb ribs was light for lamb. The waitress ( Rebecca ?) drove me nuts with her fake niceness and pushing to order more. The sommelier was awesome and had perfect recommendations for food pairing.","3533":"4 1\/2 stars\n\nThe food is well crafted and the ingredients are carefully sourced. \n\nService is generally good but not exceptional. \n\nIt's a very popular Restaraunt in the funk zone. For good reason as it is the best in that area. Reservations are strongly suggested otherwise you can see if you can get a place at the bar or community table. The community table is a great concept however, here it is an intense singles feeding frenzy that can be off putting unless of course you are fishing.","3534":"Is it possible to eat somewhere and not enjoy the food 100% but have your overall experience with the staff eclipses that factor? That was my experience at The Lark. When the reservations were made we told them we were celebrating our recent nuptials. They left a cute little note on our table congratulating us on our wedding day. Our waiter Louis was the waiter of all waiters. He guided us through every step of our food journey and boy it was a journey. All meals we ordered were served family style and were exciting interpretations of Brussel sprouts, steak and salad. We sat outside and in my opinion the outdoor seats were the best in the house. The atmosphere was fun and lively, we shared laughs with all of the staff and nearby tables. Honestly I never laughed so much at dinner in my entire life! Of course it got chilly and The Lark offers its guests blankets if you get cold and they have outdoor heaters. The drink selections were exciting and tasty. I could go on and on about the Lark. I loved our dinner here on Friday night. I think all of the hype I read prior to coming gave me higher expectations about the food. The food was a four out of five stars. Reservations are recommended and be ready to drink and be merry!","3535":"The Ambiance was fantastic...we were surrounded by rustic but modern d\u00e9cor and succulents.  Our waitress, Jazz was very helpful in describing all of the fabulous flavors within each dish.  We ordered the Brussels sprouts which were charred to perfection.  The pork belly was rich and sweet.  The dessert had candied strawberries, lime custard, poppy seed meringue, a fresh donut (which was light and fluffy with a churro taste) and sugar snap pea ice cream which was dreamy when paired with the candied strawberries!  And the craft cocktails?  WOW!  This restaurant is a must when visiting Santa Barbara!  This place is child friendly, but your child has to have a sophisticated palate to appreciate all of this deliciousness!","3536":"We tried Lark when it first opened and were disappointed in the selection for non-meat\/non-poultry eaters. Returned again tonight to give it another try and had a wonderful meal. The juicy, lemon-y shishito peppers were delicious as was the caramelized pear salad with kale and a creamy triple cream Brie-style cheese. Shared the excellent octopus (very tender) in Spanish-flavored sauce with Israeli couscous and the grilled char with cauliflower. Topped it off with the almond tart and frozen buttermilk which was the least tasty of all the dishes. Excellent service, excellent wines by the glass and a very romantic table by a fire pit made for a memorable evening.\n\nHad made a reservation with Opentable for 7 and had to wait at the bar for about 15 minutes, but we were there for a full evening experience so didn't mind. Probably not a place to go for a quick meal, especially on the weekend.\n\nThe food is fresh and innovative with layers of flavor. One of the best meals I've had in Santa Barbara.","3537":"L.A. Take Note: Michelin worthy cuisine and service!\n\nWe're not the most experienced foodies around the planet, that's for sure. But we think we know great original cuisine when we experience it, and The Lark in Santa Barbara's Funk Zone offers Michelin-worthy meals at reasonable prices with top notch service.\n\nSo far, our growing list of global foodie fun has included a couple of Michelin-starred meals in Singapore and a one-starred in Italy, plus two other amazing chefs, in Peru and in Slovenia, that don't have Michelin recognition, but they should.\u00a0\u00a0And of course, plenty of other great meals around L.A., California, and the USA.\n\nAlthough Chef Jason Paluska isn't famous (yet), he and his team prepare, present and serve their dishes so that even the most discriminating among you will be pleased with your culinary experience at The Lark. \n\nIf you live within easy driving distance of Santa Barbara as we do, or you are traveling to or through the Santa Barbara area, we can't recommend more highly that you include a meal at The Lark into your plans!\n\nTIP: Sign up for their email list so you don't miss any special events as they are awesome!","3538":"I CAN'T wait to go back to Santa Barbara JUST to vista LARK again!  SOOOOOO wonderful and SOOOO tasty! I LOVED EVERYTHING!!! Especially the popcorn (of all things!)","3539":"Unbelievable. I could eat here every nights. Get the brussel sprouts and the beet juice mojito.  I can't speak more highly of this place! Food is unbelievable, service is excellent. I would go back to Santa Barbara just for this experience.","3540":"Oh lark......you never seem to disappoint!  The energy combined with the service and quality and presentation of the food make this one of the best restauarants in SB!  The place is so versitile as well, its great for a date night, fun business outing, dinner with family or girls\/guys night out.  The bar area is lively but the outside seating is my preferred spot, especially in our SB weather.  I've been here a few times and while all the food is good, definitely have my favorites.  The roasted chicken and the burger both top my list.  I had the grilled brocolli rabe during my most recent visit and it was amazing.  The pot de creme and the ice cream sandwiches are wonderful deserts.  Looking forward to checking out their brunch on Easter!  Go now, and enjoy!","3541":"Fancy food, very good, but sometimes it feels like they are trying too hard and they might add just one too many flavors to the dish.","3542":"Here is my extremely honest and disappointing review of The Lark. After hearing the Lark's reputation, my family and I were excited to have dinner there. I was informed our table was available an hour earlier than expected so my brother and his girlfriend raced over to grab the table while the rest of our family migrated over through the large crowd on the beach. My brother and his girlfriend were continuously harassed after being seated because our party was not all there. I understand the problem this presents restaurants but I also don't think their rude attitude was appropriate customer service. Needless to say this ruined my brother and his partner's experience. When the rest of our party arrived and ordered several dishes to share, since the menu consists of \"small\" plates meant to share. Well to our disappointment the Spanish octopus did not only consist of two tiny tentacles, but those tentacles were burnt. This dish was kindly taken off of our check. Our server was the only good part of our experience. The risotto was bland, the Brussels sprouts were overly salted, while the pork belly and steak were good the portions were extremely tiny. The dishes are supposedly meant to share but I would recommend a dish per person as they are quite small, the steak had three tiny slices to give you an idea.","3543":"INCREDIBLE.  This place is absolutely the best.  Amazing service.  Great, fresh, original food with unique flavors.  From the appetizer of spiced popcorn (sounds weird, but's actually amazing) -- to the appetizers (definitely get the wedge salad) -- to the mains -- the scallops were A+ and the the truffle pasta is the best truffle pasta i've ever.  Also don't leave without the lemon fritters for dessert.  Great cocktails and wine choices too.","3544":"Came here with a group of 6--we arrived when they opened and were seated promptly. They gave us several bowls of chile lime popcorn which was absolutely amazing and addicting. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Crispy Brussel Sprouts\n- Brillat Savarin Triple Creme Brie\n- Spicy Duck Confit Wings\n- Fairhill Farms Grilled Peaches\n- Little Gems 'Wedge'\n- Caramelized East Coast Diver Scallops\n- Free Range Chicken\n...and some others which I can't remember because I was too busy stuffing my face.\n\nEverything was DELICIOUS. Favorites would be the Brussel Sprouts, brie, wings, and scallops. We also ordered everything on the dessert menu--favorites would have to be the dark chocolate creme brulee, and the triple creme brie.\n\nHighly recommend this place and hope to dine here again soon!","3545":"Not understanding the raves about this place. The ambience is really nice, but the food is not. It's WAY over-spiced. Not spicy hot, just spicy funky. The ice cream was mesquite\/smoked flavored?? It was horrible. Like putting ice cream in a smoker. We had the brussels sprouts, octopus and short rib. I think the basic ingredients were fresh, but then they just kill everything with spice. Good wine list. Service was good. We won't go back because of the food which is unfortunate because ambience, service, location and drinks were all great.","3546":"As if this place needs any more good reviews.  Oh well, here comes one more.\n\nHusband and I came here for our anniversary dinner, and The Lark did not disappoint.  We split the \"wedge\" salad, cauliflower gratin, pork belly sliders, hanger steak, and pot de creme.  \n\n1.) The \"wedge\" salad was hands down the best salad I have ever had in my life.  The bacon and blue cheese chunks were generous, and the dressing was just heavenly.  \n\n2.) The pork belly sliders were delicious.  I almost feel like the ratio of meat to bun was off (with the bun dominating), but I'm not really complaining.  We made the mistake of ordering 4 sliders, rather than sticking with the 3 that come on the plate.  Three sliders is more than enough.  \n\n3.) The cauliflower gratin is perfect comfort food.  Husband and I debated while eating the gratin if we were tasting lemon zest or juice.  The lemon flavor was a bit overpowering, but interesting nonetheless.  \n\n4.) The hangar steak dish was perfect.  Medium rare meat with broccoli and shallots.  You can't really go wrong.  \n\n5.) The pot de creme is served cold in a swing top jar.  The brittle crumble on top is the perfect crunch to pair with the pudding like consistency of the cold creme.\n\nOh, and The Lark's starter popcorn is such a nice change from the typical table bread and butter.  \n\nI could only manage to drink one glass of wine (Roark's Chenin Blanc).  I regret not trying a cocktail.  \n\nWe will be back...probably pretty soon because we can't stop talking about how great our meal was.","3547":"Such a beautiful place! Nicest restaurant in Santa Barbara. We were treated like family. The food was a amazing. The steak skirt was my favorite. The drinks were strong and plentiful. Nothing but good comments about this place. :)\n\nWe were even 10 minutes late for our reservation and they were STILL holding our table. Unbelievable! Top of the line employees. Thanks The Lark.","3548":"My husband and I do not eat out often, we're usually disappointed  in one way or another.  A disappointing experience last night at another location reminded me of how I wanted to praise The Lark for being the first restaurant to not only meet but exceed our expectations in a very long time.  \n\nThere is nothing I can suggest for improvement on the food.  We loved everything that we tried.  Beware, the portions are larger than you would expect! We ordered 5 items and would have been fine with 4. However we do not regret getting to taste a 5th dish :)  We ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, the House Made Pimento, the Heirloom Tomato Panzanella, the  Crispy Smoked Pork Belly and the Dungeness Crab and Housemade Gnocchi.  While everything was delicious, I have to say that we were most impressed with the Pork Belly, it was AMAZING.  \n\nThe drink menu is also impressive, very unique and refreshing cocktails and a great wine list.  The ambiance is wonderful; classy yet comfortable.  \n\nHaving worked in the hospitality business for many years, both my husband and I are very aware of service.  The Lark's 5 star service was a breath of fresh air from what we are used to experiencing. Everyone, from the greeter to the hostess to the servers to the bus boy was friendly, knowledgeable and available.  \n\nThank you Lark for your exceptional service and your amazing food. We will be back many times and be giving many recommendations.","3549":"Es un restaurant en la funky zone de SAnta B\u00e1rbara, si bien es una onda medio newyorkina distinta al estilo de ac\u00e1, es buen\u00edsimo. Es trendy y por eso atrae mucha gente, incluso un martes nublado. Prueben los esp\u00e1rragos y el the mule","3550":"What can I say about this place but \"Wow\". As an admitted non foodie, my girlfriend and I were in Santa Barbara for a getaway weekend and I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner. I made reservations at The Lark before we left Los Angeles because I read that it gets busy. It was VERY busy, and for good reason. When you first arrive you may not think much because from the street you can't see much of the establishment. However, we arrived at night and the outside setup was so inviting and gorgeous. They had flowers and fire pits everywhere and it looked so relaxing and warm. But it was the food that knocked it out of the park! We had the the octopus and the squash as well as the brisket ( I can't remember what the last dish was but it was delicious). Everything is served with such great presentation and the flavored they created were amazing. I can't stress enough that for me as a non foodie to be impressed takes a lot. Coupled with the service this place is a MUST if you have a free evening while in Santa Barbara.","3551":"I used to love The Lark but apparently it has turned into a Middle Eastern restaurant. There used to be this amazing half chicken on the menu that was woodfired, smoky and amazing. It was on top of the most decadent mashed potatoes ever. I ordered it last night and it turned into some Harissa flavored Moroccan bullshit. It was inedible and the mashed potatoes were tasteless. The asparagus have the same sauce. The only thing that remained the same were the brussels sprouts. They were so nice and took the chicken off the bill. I just don't think I can go back until the menu changes back. Damn shame.","3552":"This place is excellent.  We ate here about a month ago and I don't remember everything we ordered, but we got about 6 things and they were all great.  It gets extremely crowded, so must have a reservation.  The cocktails here are pretty great and I found to be worth the price.","3553":"Food and the service was fantastic. I ate things I wouldn't normally eat because I don't like brussels sprouts and cauliflower somehow they made it taste delicious.\n\nThe service was the best I've encountered in quite sometime.","3554":"My boyfriend and I recently had dinner at The Lark while in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a great space.  Indoor and outdoor seating with trendy decor. \n\nHowever, we were disappointed in the service -- primarily, our portion-pushing waitress -- and felt misguided.  We were advised that most dishes are meant to be shared, and she recommended 4-5 dishes for two people.  So we deferred to her.\n\nWhat followed was an onslaught of food.  The panzanella salad was overwhelmingly large and far too creamy - the tomatoes seemed marinated in feta cheese.  The vegetable ratatouille was enough to feed a small village.  And by the team the pork dish came out, we could not stomach another bite.  \n\nWe would have enjoyed our experience more if we ordered less food.  So, just be careful not to let the waitstaff push you into ordering too much -- because it adds up in your stomach and on your credit card.","3555":"Sat outside early evening Saturday and loved the patio. Was bummed they only seemed to have Chardonnay choices by the glass, no Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris except by the bottle so I settled for one of their cocktails, The Aviator. It was ... odd. But I drank it and it was strong. The person I was with got the Mule cocktail and enjoyed it but we both wished we had just ordered vodka tonics instead. The brussel sprouts were amazing and had a nice kick to them. They were pan fried in some kind of sesame spicey sauce. Really good. Could split between 4 people. The pimento toast was also great too. We split the burger\/fries (off the bar menu) - also super tasty. Service was great. Ambiance wonderful on a balmy evening. The Lark is in the Funk Zone so parking is tough.","3556":"We were in Santa Barbara and wanted to taste some of the local wines with dinner, Lark had an amazing selection of local wines and the bar head had a great in depth knowledge of them. \n\nDinner was also fantastic, with a great roast chicken, the best sides and more... Highly recommend anyone come here!!","3557":"Such innovation! When the complimentary munchies are mind blowing, you know you're in for a treat. Every platter is a surprising blend of flavors! Definitely worth trying. A nice little restaurant tucked in the industrial district of town.","3558":"A darling restaurant located amid a neighborhood that is in transition. There's plenty of outdoor seating, and the service is attentive. I was dining with a bunch of vegetarians, so we stuck to the dishes featuring vegetables, all of which were good. The standouts were the fried green tomatoes, the pimento cheese, and the beets mixed with pluots. The wine list is good and features many options that are under $50. We ordered four dishes, a side dish, and a bottle of rose. With tax and tip, it ended up being $40 a person. Some of the meat dishes were a little more expensive, but they looked worth it. (Believe me, I was eyeing them from across the restaurant--those dastardly vegetarians!)","3559":"This place is fantastic!  My friend and I decided to dine here twice while in Santa Barbara. The New York platter, Brussels sprouts and cheese platter are to die for. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Very helpful with wine pairings. \nCan't wait to go back!","3560":"We read so many great reviews in Yelp. Unfortunately, my experience was filled with lack-luster moments. Had 9pm reservations on Wednesday 9\/20\/2017...to celebrate my 43rd birthday. Had great dirty martinis (hats off to the bartenders....however, that's not the whole experience). \nThey prefaced the service as being \"family-style dining\". That is code for...one dish comes out at what ever rate the kitchen gets around to deliver out. Case in point, the table next to us: both had ordered a burger and fries. She gets the burger and 10 minutes later, he gets his... I also overheard another table asking why she had gotten her steamed mussels but her partner had nothing. He is a vegetarian and had ordered a salad. Anyway, we had the apps and they were great!  However, we waiting over 15 minutes for dirty martinis. After I had my delicious appetizer (both which came out a t different times....)my utensils were taken away. Never replaced. My lamb shank was delicious but I had my serving fork to eat my meal. I asked the waitress if it was ok to take the plate setting from the next table....wtf?!?!?!  Then my husband ordered the pappardelle dish--after another 15 minute wait from my lamb shank, we got an overcooked pasta that resembled Lipton pasta in a bag.  Got the dish removed from the check but nothing to rectify this. Final reviews: I would come back but only for drinks ???? Poor expediting from the kitchen.  Disappointed. Very disappointed.","3561":"By far the best meal I've had this trip - the wedge salad and beet salad were absolutely incredible. Then we had the hanger steak and papperedelli, soo good, with unexpected flavors. The mint with the broccoli, I'm not usually a mint fan, but this was so good. Then the citrus notes on the pasta were delicious. We had the hazelnut ice cream sandwich ( very powerful flavor ) and the marscapone profiteroles which were delicate. Perfect ending. Just wish we had room for dessert wine, maybe next time!","3562":"This place has great atmosphere, great service,  and some of the best food I've eaten.  We had the Brussels sprouts, oysters, and spicy duck wings, which were all phenomenal.  The ice cream sandwich with passion fruit drizzle was an unexpected treat to finish our meal.  Even the cheesey jalapeno popcorn they give you to munch on while you wait was so flavorful and delicious.  Will recommend and visit again whenever I can.","3563":"Their food is really particular, if you want to try some new taste you need to come here.","3564":"Delicious food and great ambiance. I would most definitely return for dinner and drinks","3565":"Excellent ... you can choose throughout the menu and share. Farm fresh veggies, tasty entrees and yummy desserts. Great ambiance too.","3566":"By far my favorite resturaunt for a splurge night out. Amazing food, service and atmosphere.  NOTHING else like it in Santa Barbara.","3567":"Amazingly weird food, your mind might doubt but your taste will say thanks!\nGnocchi with crab is awesome. The staff and kitchen is very sensitive to allergies. \nAsk for Ian","3568":"Our Uber driver recommended The Lark, and I'm so glad he did. The ambience was lovely. We shared the duck confit wings (spicy and delicious), the grilled peach and tomato salad was so flavorful, and the black pepper papparadelle with pork belly blew my mind. We had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passion fruit ice cream. It was one of the best desserts I ever eaten.","3569":"The Lark is conveniently located within the Funk Zone, home to the Urban Wine Trail, where we spent the afternoon wine tasting. There's a communal \ntable and bar where you can get full meals, which may be a good option since this place is super popular.We lucked out getting a table with no reservations, I'm sure that is a rarity. It was bursting at the seems busy.\n\nGreat atmosphere, delicious food, and we will be returning. This place is special.\n\nI started with cocktail, then switched to wine. I had the Rhubarb Greyhoud Proper - death's door gin, rhubarb, rosemary, grapefruit. It was nice and refreshing.\n\nThis is what we had to eat:\nCarmelized Cauliflower gratin - gruyer, preserved lemon, chili flake, bacon, breadcrumbs\nCrispy Braised Pork Belly Sliders - Peaches, Whole Grain Aioli and Smoked Sea Salt\nDuck Liver Mouse - warm spiced pears, salted cashews, cutler's bourbon, charred bread, crisp crunchy frisee\nMary's Chicken - smashed yukon\u200d gold, smoked cippolini, bacon, pea tendrils, texas style bbq jus\n\nEverything was absurdly wonderful and flavorful. I wanted to try pretty much everything on the menu, but that just wasn't possible. Next time!","3570":"Fun atmosphere - a great cross section of laid back locals to over-dressed shmooshers. But the service was great: got chatting about bourbon and before you know it we had custom cocktails that were superb. The food fluctuated between superb (the Japanese eggplant starter) to mediocre (the grilled prawns) but overall good and well priced. We were disappointed by the dessert menu but didn't order any so maybe it's great. Recommend!","3571":"Love The Lark.  It is THE place to be in the funk zone if your looking to impress.  Great service and food.  I went many times on my visit and will do so again.","3572":"We were excited to eat here as we had previously missed an opportunity and made reservation easily using Opentable.\nThe location in gentrified warehouse district adds charm and the architecture and design is urban industrial and well creative. \nStaff is friendly college aged and some were knowledgeable and helpful.  \nCocktail menu was compact and had nice choices.  I tried the spicy cocktail which had jalape\u00f1o but did not offer much kick.\nFood presentation was beautiful but unfortunately there was a long delay for our shared main of short ribs.  We eventually asked and with the surprised look by server and we figured that it was missed so we asked if we could cancel but she would not let us.  It finally came and the meat was undercooked and not tender which was disappointing.   \nOtherwise this restaurant is a nice place for an evening of contemporary urban chic American food.","3573":"The food here is amazing.  A-MAY-ZING.  Unusual menu, food is so very good.  As many others have mentioned, the roasted Brussels sprouts are wonderful.  \n\nThe concept is plates to share, and that is what we did.  The little gem salad is a fresh take on a classic, wonderfully flavored and not heavy.  The squash salad was also wonderful.  The entrees we ordered (octopus, trout, and chicken) were enjoyed by all.\n\nThe portions are good sized.  We had way too much food for four people (1 app, 2 salads, 3 entrees).  All were enjoyed.\n\nI'm not giving five stars for the following:  the restaurant was way too loud to hear conversation amongst your party.  That's not good.  And, the service was just OK.  Staff seemed put out when we asked questions about the food, or when I asked for some ice with my water.  And, they were trying to seat people outside even though it was 45 degrees out and winds at 18MPH.  So, be aware of that when you go.","3574":"Dining at the Lark is odd. Brace yourself for a pretentious menu and strange cocktails. My friend and I split a couple of dishes, which were ultimately leaves and flowers drapes on a plate. The tartine was a baguette with said leaves and flowers. Food looks pretty, but the flavors are bland. Service was ok. Prepare to be hurried along if you didn't make a reservation.","3575":"Always delicious, although I sometimes feel they sacrifice flavor for creativity in presentation and ingredients. Beautiful patio, great cocktails and a wonderful wine list.","3576":"We made a reservation 2 months in advance, and were not seated even 15 minutes after our reservation time. There was no sign of us getting a table anytime soon, so we left. Disappointed as we were excited to try this place.","3577":"My favorite spot in Funk Zone and one of the top in Santa Barbara in general. Really hip design and ambiance. Food is impeccable. Top favorites include marrow bone, especially the bread it comes with, the best rosemary bread period. \n\nLove their selection of wine.","3578":"Loved this place! Food and service were awesome. Flavors were totally unique. Highly recommend this as a special occasion destination.","3579":"Always dialed.  From valet to hostess to service and food.  Love Suzie at the bar!","3580":"Come on down & bring your fur baby! This place is very welcoming. My boyfriend & I came here dinner a month ago for his birthday. The food here is wonderful & the staff is super friendly! They gave my boyfriend a birthday postcard & a free dessert. They are very accommodating. We will be back to try their brunch menu!","3581":"A must try when u are in Santa Barbara!  \n\nThe smoked pork belly with Almond brittle was our favorite dish. \n\nWe also had the Hamachi crude & Brussels sprouts - both left me wanting more. \n\nWashed it down with a couple of their signature drinks & wine - perfect dinner.","3582":"Really fun place. I like the Brussel sprouts. Go with a group so you can sample lots of food.","3583":"When expecting good food based on reviews. Brussels sprout appetizer was great. Wine selection very good. Service superb, ambiance LOUD but tolerable on a weekday night. Entrees were very disappointing. Lamb spareribs were carbonized. Not recognizable as meat, just charred to black. The pasta had many strong flavors all battling and also loud. Not a good experience and will not return.","3584":"The was one of the best places I have been to in SB! The food is perfection and the wine selection rocks. Our server was lovely and very educated on the menu gave us both great pairings. I will definitely be back","3585":"Wanted to give a quick update on this based on my last visit there. I came for dinner with a friend who has significant allergies, and our waitress\/the kitchen could not have been more accommodating or diligent about my friend's food limitations. Our waitress (I forget her name!) was extremely attentive as my friend explained his multiple restrictions and immediately began offering suggestions and menu changes so that he could enjoy the meal to the fullest! There wasn't a single slip up and my friend was able to dine with total ease, which is very rare for him. Thank you so much to The Lark for being so accommodating, friendly, and helpful for those with allergies and dietary restrictions!!! It was an unforgettable evening!","3586":"Upon the recommendation of our hotel, we had dinner there on a Sunday night. The place was popping. We had a drink at the bar - lots of wine and craft beer options. For dinner, we set outside (hear lamps worked). Food was outstanding and we really liked out waitress.\n\nWe liked lark so much, we tired to go back on Monday - sadly they were closed. We look forward to our next visit to SB so we can go to Lark again!","3587":"Food and atmosphere is great.  Really enjoy sharing plates here.  Cocktails are excellent.  Can be difficult to get a table if you don't have reservations.","3588":"There is a reason that the Lark is consistently rated as a must-see in national magazines and regional spotlights. We went here for our Valentine's day dinner, and the service was just impeccable. It's surprising, because I've heard that the Lark's one downside is their service. However, our waitress and everyone else I saw was super engaged and really helpful on what to order. The way to go is definitely to order two apps and two entrees for two people. Everything is slightly smaller portions, so with those four in the line up, it's an ideal dinner. I can't think of another restaurant where the food was so good and beautiful in presentation that I took so many pictures. Well done Lark!","3589":"The staff here are very friendly and service is quick. We went with a group of 10 ladies and had drinks and appetizers on the table really quick. The biggest problem was portions. Our server told us that they were big, good for ordering family style, which we did. However the portions are definitely not sharing size! The taste is fine, but for the price we were expecting either superb food or larger portions.","3590":"Amazingly good food and service. Cannot stress this enough. Had a couple of Apps and the char entree. Deviled eggs not the best I've had. Brussel sprouts were the best I have had - hands down- anywhere from BY to LA. Please go and enjoy.","3591":"The fried Brussels sprouts with capers and Cobb salad (I went with no bacon).... Aaaaaaa-mahhhh-ziiinnnngggg!","3592":"On my third attempt to come here, the best they could do was a seat at the bar. I'm not sure if it's the holiday rush or if there is just too much hype over this place (and the funk zone in general), but apparently it's pretty hard to get a table. I've heard this from the locals as well.\n\nThe menu is tapas style, though they do have larger platters on the menu as an option. There were three of us dinning and we ordered the marinated hanger steak, herb roasted scallops, brussel sprouts, cauliflower gratin, and the deviled eggs. Everything was really good, but the steak was especially flavorful and tender. The scallops were good, but I didn't taste the jalape\u00f1os and the pork belly was a little on the dry side. Overall I felt the dish had more bark thank bite. Loved the crispiness of the pancetta on the deviled eggs, and my friend loved the lemon flavors in the cauliflower.\n\nTo top our meal we ordered the citrus pavlova for dessert. We were all pavlova virgins and didn't really know what to expect. It was basically a meringue shell with a citrus cream filling. I thought it was good, but prefer bread based desserts. My friend who is a candy lover, enjoyed it the most. \n\nI loved the space. It's very cozy, somewhat industrial, has nice lighting and good acoustics. Can't believe I'm commenting on acoustics, but yeah, I'm getting that picky in my mature age and enjoy listening to my friends talk during dinner. It's also worth mentioning this place is  pricey. If you are pretty hungry be prepared to spend quite a bit.","3593":"My wife and I had a very enjoyable dining experience at the Lark.\n\nThe food and ambiance were both very good, and we look forward to returning.\n\nWe shared a number of dishes, and all were very well thought out, and very tasty.  Service was good and we had an overall very nice experience.","3594":"A LA restaurant in Santa Barbara.  A good thing and a bad thing at the same time.  This place seems to be the \"it\" place at the moment as it's packed and reservations are long.  \n\nThe location is in an up and coming new area of town that's away from the touristy State Street.  It's more of a bar-ish areas and that's a good thing.  There's a really cool wine bar next door to this place that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves.  The restaurant itself is rather large but well done in a rustic industrial feel.  \n\nThe food is pretty good for a restaurant this size that's packed.  The style is your normal farm-to-table LA faire with your mix of braised meats with pasta and your kale salads.  While not spectacular, I am glad to see Santa Barbara offering some newer fare in a more modern environment.","3595":"Deeeeelicious. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night after driving in from LA. This place has a lovely rustic ambiance, and inspired pairings on their menu. \n\nThe crab gnocchi with orange sections, green olive, and baby cilantro was one of the most flavorful dishes we had ever eaten. We also enjoyed the chickpea tagine and the beet and strawberry salad. Note that all the dishes are meant to be served family style, so if you're looking to sample a bunch of different dishes, this is definitely the place for you!","3596":"All dishes ordered = amazing; pimento cheese balls, wedge salad, octopus, pork chops.","3597":"The Lark is absolutely fantastic. Freshest ingredients done with incredible flair. Situated in the heart of Santa Barbara's hustling exciting \"Funk Zone\", this is one excellent place. Start with the lightly blanched and seasoned olives, then have the Wedge, done with crispy romaine wedges with light beautiful blue cheese vinaigrette with savory thick cut pork belly. The Kale salad w Pecorino and pomegranates is to die for.\n\nServed family style, try the Bronzino or the Short Ribs, and the Pastrami seasoned New York steak.\n\nThe servers are perhaps the best trained staff in Santa Barbara. Courteous and helpful, ask for Lourika who will make your night a memorable one. Skyler was an amazing hands on manager.\n\nMy highest rating!! Oh, and try the desserts!","3598":"This place was EXCELLENT! We shared everything and liked everything. Complementary popcorn was awesome. :) We got some of the snacks -- cornbread and brussels sprouts. Both were excellent! I loved that the brussels had dates in there. We also had the garden salanova. It was beautiful and tasty. I think the prettiest salad I have had in a restaurant like this. We also had the ocean trout -- it was super. I loved the tangerines and the veggies that came with it. Everyone else at the table loved the ribs. usually pasta is pasta. But the papardelle was great. It had lots of fresh veggies, including super sweet peas. Overall, everything was really delicious! We would absolutely come back!","3599":"I can't say enough good things about The Lark! The ambience was romantic with candlelight at every table. The outdoor patio was lovely with beautiful flowers, statement iron work, and lovely eating spaces surrounding fire tabletops. We had the pleasure of dining inside. We were seated promptly by friendly host staff. Though depending on the day of the week you may want to get a reservation as seating tends to fill up quick! The wait staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and had a desire to serve. The food was melt in your mouth incredible. We started with the brussel sprouts which is an appetizer that they are known for. They are a must try! Then we ordered the rib eye for two. It was served with mushrooms and parsnips. The combination was delectable! The meat was cooked to perfection! As a complementary starter they hand out house seasoned warm popcorn that uses a variety of seasoning. Beware, it is addicting! Definitely a place to try out when you're in SB :), enjoy your meal!","3600":"Every part was Amazing!! This establishment understands the importance of customer service and my friends and I had a lovely time here. We arrived a little early for our reservation and the bar was full so the hostess offered to show us to the wine bar located in the back. Also amazing staff and most importantly great wine selection. When we got to our table for dinner out waiter was very attentive right away and guided us in how the food works. It's family style so we ordered several apps, the chicken, crab, and pork chops. Everything was Delicious. My favorite was the chicken but the pork chops were the best I've ever had!! I will def be coming back!","3601":"Ariel, the bartender, is wonderful! She makes incredible drinks, and she flawlessly multi-tasked while we engaged her in conversation. We sat at the bar for dinner, and she took great care of us. She's exceptional at this job, and she'll no doubt be highly successful in any endeavor she chooses. Our experience at The Lark was outstanding.","3602":"Meh. We came here on date night on Saturday and it was pretty packed. The complimentary vinegar popcorn (too small a portion), was also too vinegary.\nWe had been to a few other places for drinks before we ended up here, and so we weren't too hungry...so just got the main course. \nI got the wild salmon, and H got the pork belly. It was underwhelming. The wild salmon was actually sushi, and was nothing spectacular. The pork belly was good, but overpriced. \n\nOverall, no bang for the buck.","3603":"We have only dined at The Lark twice.  The first time was at a table with a reservation.  We had a great waitress, she was very helpful with guiding us through the menu and with picking out some drinks.  Our dinner overall was delicious, although we ordered the duck mouse and I would not order it again.  The mouse made the toast soggy and it was hard to eat.  The pieces of toast were too large and the crust was too hard to bite through.  \n\nThe second time we dined there we sat at the communal table in the bar area.  We really enjoyed our dinner, the oysters were delicious.  And we had a great conversation with the people sitting next to us.  We will be back to eat again.","3604":"We had an incredible anniversary dinner here! Every dish was delightful, from the deviled eggs and brussels to the hamachi and duck liver. The flavors were totally unique and nuanced. Our waiter David was amazing, he advised us perfectly on every detail and was really personable yet highly professional. We also really enjoyed being able to scope out the magic happening in the kitchen. Those guys were working suuuuper hard and it showed in the food. Overall, it was a fantastic experience!","3605":"Wow! Crowded, chaotic, fun. Also super friendly, responsive service and great, great food.\n\nBone Marrow.......omg\nDeviled Eggs....yummy\nDeep fried olives.... Wtf???? But so good\n\nPork chop  and Steak platter so good and complex. This is really a stand out restaurant. Cheers to the owners and to those that manage. A great accomplishment.","3606":"Had dinner at The Lark last night. Very popular and trendy place to be in SB. All the dishes are very bold. We had a group of 4 and ordered 4 dishes and cocktails. The size portions are good to share and all flavors were very bold and heavy. Taste wise I would give them a solid 3.5 but I docked them 1\/.5 points because the first dishes came as planned but there must have been a mixed up in the kitchen but our last 2 dishes took them over 40 mins to bring out. No aplohogies tho we mentioned and asked about 4 times. Really like the fact that they change out dishes at every course.","3607":"On the pricey side, but an excellent restaurant for a special occasion or celebration. The Brussels sprouts,\nHangar steak and grilled octopus are delicious. Our server Fernando was exceptional as well.","3608":"Superb service and food. Our server was so genuine- delighted in our happiness with our selections. Loved the setting - typical California casual - appeared like tables if you had a reservation, communal if not. Delish cocktails, and terrific combinations of ingredients in every dish. The octopus dish was wild - like steak. Best dish was the pappardelle. Amazing. Highly recommend.","3609":"Any new restaurant has growing pains, but Lark is clearly having lots of pains. \n\nFour of us on a Friday night and practically every phase had problems, from the hostess who messed up big time by seating half the party and telling the other have that had no reservation not 5 minutes later, to crazy slow bar service, and two dishes never showing up from the kitchen. If you're gonna ask us to order 3-4 plates per person, you should at least deliver it when we do. \n \n On the plus side, what we did try was pretty good. But popcorn and deviled eggs seem kind of lame on a menu for a place that is trying so hard to be cool. Same with the bar, just make good stuff and stop trying so hard to be cute with only boutique brands and serving in mason jars. Prices were okay and the waitress was trying hard and nice as could be.\n\nIn a nutshell, give a try if you want, just lower your expectation bar. On a more cynical note as a marketing person. Take note that all of the 5 star ratings on this place came from Yelpers with no photo, no friends and no criticism. I don't think so. Not cool Lark to write your own reviews.","3610":"The Lark was amazing! I requested a seat for my 14 month toddler and it was setup before we got there. 2 chairs and a high chair. I knew we were off to a good experience from that moment. The food was delicious in so many ways. I could not stop saying to my wife, bone marrow, wedge, New York steak and the quinoa were simply perfect! I highly recommend this place when visiting Santa Barabara.","3611":"We had dinner at The Lark and it was excellent. Our server Lourika was excellent! She gave great advice on how much food to order and checked in on us often. No one walked by the table without making sure we were ok. The wedge salad was fantastic as were the oysters on the half shell and pork bellies. I will stop in anytime u am in Santa Barbara.","3612":"This place was amazing!  We went with some friends and had a fabulous time.  The service was top notch and the food incredible.  By far my favorite dining experience in Santa Barbara.  The decor was beautiful, we never felt rushed, drinks were flavorful..zero complaints! This place is a must!","3613":"AMAZING SERVICE.\n\nFrom the valet to our server, the service was super friendly and helpful, without being irritating or fake.\n\nThe ambiance was energetic.  \n\nAs a vegetarian, we were pretty limited on options, but the restaurant tried their best within their limitations.","3614":"Lark has a hipster\/modern like ambiance and decor to it. I do like some of the lighting and booth designs. I enjoyed the complimentary popcorn to snack on.\n\nThe deviled eggs were tasty! I wish there were a bit more jalape\u00f1os as I couldn't find the taste of them. Regardless a tasty good dish. It is definitely a tad different than the deviled eggs I am use to. The pork really makes this dish as it provides a nice crunchy texture and a smoky taste to it. \n\nThe pork belly dish was great and different than I am use to. I have had pork belly cooked similar in other places, but Lark pairs ingredients with it that just change the pork belly experience. I thought the berries and almond brittle were a bit strange; however, it went surprisingly well with the pork belly and crunchy chicharron.","3615":"Great atmosphere: social, hip, and not too stuffy. The menu was fresh and for the most part family style, which fit the communal-like ambiance. We shared the ratatouille which was delicious.","3616":"One of the best restaurants I had on my pacific highway trip last week. They use lots of fresh vegetables and it was yummy. I had the beet salad and profiteroles which were excellent. My husband had the short ribs and pork dishes and it was way too much food for him. We regret having gone with a small appetite because we wanted to eat more.","3617":"Wonderful atmosphere! Amazing bartenders. The food was simple, fresh and full of bold tastes.","3618":"Awesome place! If you can't get a table, hold out for the communal table! Perfect food, drink and service. Fun!!","3619":"Amazing food, alright service. Our main course took about 30 min and it was the incorrect order. No mention about why it was taking so long from our waitress. Great Ambience and drinks!","3620":"Trendy bar with really pretty decor. A little bit busy and loud because it's so popular, making it hard to talk to the other person. Good for groups rather than a date dinner spot. Definitely get the lemon fritters blueberry ice cream dessert! It was delicious! We showed a little early and the host said we are perfectly on time for our 9 o'clock reservation but we still didn't get seated till around 920pm.","3621":"We went there for a graduation dinner celebration.  The staff did a phenomenal job making it work despite our large group with a mixture of special requests from vegan to gluten free.  The food was divine, the service outstanding and everyone left with a smile.","3622":"Creative, interesting and delicious, The Lark is at the crossroads of foodie and homey. Generous portions and reasonably priced for the food quality, quantity and creativity- this is definitely a winner. The Lark shares a space with Les Marchand as well which is a wonderful place for a pre- or post- dinner glass of bubbles and\/or other wine. Highly recommended.","3623":"Fantastic!! Reservations are usually a must, but we hit the opening and sat at the community table. We started w\/ the Charcuterie board, excellent. Followed w\/ the Duck Liver Mousse... sinful. The last course was the Texas Redfish platter, the freshest fish prepared in a mild spicy Creole fashion, we are discriminating fish people, and this more than met our expectations. All this followed by some amazing desserts, never thought we would be able to eat the desserts, but duty called. Our server Louie was very helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive, without hovering. Lark is the king of the Funkzone","3624":"Hard for me to rate. I was sick from bad burrito so could not enjoy. Not the fault of The Lark.\n\nAfter being sick all afternoon from bad burrito at Los Agaves, wondering if I should cancel my reservation, by evening was feeling better so figured I'd go. I did decide to drive, although my original intention had been to walk (about 2 miles each way from where I was staying). Good thing I did. They have \"free\" valet parking; of course I did tip.\n\nAnyway got the Garden of Salanova salad, thought about cornbread but figured I'd hold off as server said salad pretty big. It was but I eat lots of salad normally. Sadly, it was the last thing I was able to eat.\n\nHesitated between soft shell crab and quail but decided on quail as sauce on crab looked pretty rich and my innards were still shaky. I had ordered the GIdget, not as innocent as the 60s surfer girl even though non-alcoholic; with jalapeno, it packed a punch. Quail was on bed of black eyed peas with sausage, spicy okra, green beans. Just too much heavy and spicy food, after about two bites that bad burrito came back to haunt me and I was really sick. Not just full or bloaty, sick. I was able to manage the quail and the green beans, barely, could not finish drink, just had to get out and get back to where i was staying. Normally I could eat a hobnailed boot but not this night. Really disappointing as I had so looked forward to eating there.\n\nI do agree, however, with those who say food was too \"busy\". I am reminded of a restaurant in San Francisco, Rich Table, where food is good quality and well prepared but simply overdone. Quail does not need all that \"stuff\"; I think maybe just the green beans and a rice pilaf would have worked better.\n\nWaiter very nice.\n\nI don't know when I will next be in Santa Barbara but in the interest of fairness want to try The Lark again so I can at least give complete review, not to mention finish my meal!","3625":"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE!  The location, the design, the staff, the service, the drinks, the presentation of the food, the perfect seasoning and use of incredibly fresh ingredients, the kitchen, the lighting, the atmosphere, the sound... It is definitely my fav place to eat in SB!  I cannot wait to go back!","3626":"Impressed by the high quality customer service and meticulously created ambiance. Their menu is one of the most interesting in Santa Barbara with fresh, fun and well thought out dining options. The brussel sprouts are scrumptious and everything on the menu is consistently yummy.","3627":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Great all the way!! Amazing gem in SB!! Great service, courteous and super friendly owner and the food: master piece to admire and delectable party in your mouth!! \nGreat dining experience!","3628":"I'm giving 4.5 because although the food is excellent...the staff attentive, once you've paid your $200 bill for 4...you apparently become invisible.  No help to be found. No water, no one around.\nI clearly understand tables need to be \"turned\", but perhaps friends need to linger \nAnd chat.  It's Sunday night, the place isn't jammed...just say'in.","3629":"Would definitely come back here. \nLoved the ambience \nFood was fantastic\n\nBest thing was the braised pork shoulder sliders and beet salad. Close second were the scallops. \n\nFree valet is always a plus. \n\nThe pot de creme was just eh.","3630":"Perfect Evening\n\nWe enjoyed our evening at The Lark so much that we can't wait to return. We started the night at the vibrant bar. It was a Friday night and The Lark seemed to be the place to see and be seen. We were lucky enough to get a seat so we ordered drinks and a few appetizers. We had some delicious wine accompanied by the deviled eggs (best deviled eggs I've ever had!) and the pimento cheese with toast (doesn't sound appealing but trust me!). Both appetizers were amazing. The pimento toast came with grilled break that was to die for. We had to get seconds on the bread! We were ushered to our table on time, a cozy table with tons of ambiance. We had the veal shank over roasted veggies which truly fell off the bone and was delicious and the himachi crudo, a light, very tasty entree. Alas, we were too full for dessert but I'm sure they are equally impressive. The service was flawless both at the bar and the table. It is refreshing to have such a perfect evening on all fronts. Make sure to reserve in advance this place is HOT!","3631":"acoustics are terrible. meals are over priced and not that great. staff was great, but I'm now told they treat staff terribly. They ask kitchen staff to work off the clock (totally illegal). Super bummed, because it looked nice from the outside.","3632":"The food is fantastic but be prepared to wait a long time to get in and save your pennies before going. It's pricey but worth it for fellow foodies!","3633":"This place was hopping and is obviously the hot spot in Santa Barbara these days - filled with beautiful people. Given the rave reviews we were quite excited to eat here. It's not that I was disappointed but I don't think it lived up to all the hype.\n\nFirst of all - unless you like sitting outside under heaters, on the typically windy cool SB nights - make sure to request inside when you make your reservation.  We had a reservation and granted our table was ready when we arrived but it was outside, and it was a cold evening. None of us wanted to shiver under the heaters and wrap offered blankets around us while we ate. We opted to wait for an inside table.  We waited under the heaters, as there is no place at the bar to wait, and were seated about 20 minutes later. \n\nService was attentive and friendly.  Please note - the server suggested that we should plan on sharing family style and dishes were small so she advised we order 2 per person.  We ordered 6 dishes, there were 3 of us. After they brought the brussell sprouts and the asparagus salad (which is large actually) we flagged the waitress and canceled 2 dishes. It would have been way too much food!  We caught her too late so we were at least able to cancel 1 dish. So we cancelled the duck liver mousse (bummer as I really wanted to try that)\n\nWhat we ate:\n1. Brussell Sprouts - were raved about on the reviews here. They were fine but honestly nothing I would rave about. \n2. Broccolini - delish\n3. Asparagus salad - very tasty but overdressed.  We all would have enjoyed it better if it was floating in dressing. \n4. Mussels - the mussels themselves were just muscles. I thought they were on the small side. the broth is the real winner here. Make sure to order extra bread. \n5. hanger steak - this was my favorite dish. Meat was tender and dish seasoning quite complementary. \n\nAll in all - honestly - it's not a place I would rush back to but SB is definitely rallying around it. Maybe we ordered the wrong things or our expectations were too high.","3634":"I'm not exaggerating when I say this is THE BEST restaurant I have ever been to; and I eat out frequently. From their most delicious and creative foods to their incredible outdoor and indoor vibe, you just have to go to see for yourself. Thank you guys!","3635":"Great food.  Fantastic food.  Good service.  Pretentious service.  My fianc\u00e9e is a vegetarian.  'Oh, you're a vegetarian?  We have chicken.'  Also, not sure why you can't just sell a charcuterie plate as a cheese plate and sans the meat.  No desserts to go.  'All desserts are pre-plated.'  We can land an astronaut on the moon, but can't transfer a dessert to a box.  \n\nThat being said, the cheese and fig appetizer is ridiculously awesome, and the entrees and ambiance were on point as well.  Drop a little of the attitude and it's five stars.","3636":"We had a friend's casual birthday get together at the large community table.  I must say that it was pretty loud in there so it made it difficult to speak to anyone who wasn't sitting right next to me. So for a group, if you plan to do this, plan to move around and change places with people so that you can party with others in the group. The food was good (tapas type) to great and so were the prices...meaning you PAY A LOT for what you get! Since each dish we ordered had smallish amounts of food to share, one has to order multiple dishes to create a meal. Overall, I am glad we went, had a pretty good time but next time I will try for the outdoor patio when it gets warmer outside. That seems like it would be more conducive to conversation. Nice and unique features: valet parking is good to have in the funk zone where its sometimes really hard to find a place to park. Also, a large window so that you can see the entire kitchen staff at work creating their stuff. Very fun to watch.","3637":"Loved Lark!\n\nMy girl and I went last night. Up front, I want to extend my most sincere appreciation for the service provided by Amy (at the community table) and Doug (who served our dinner). Both were charming and so accommodating. If that is the level of service we can expect in the future, we will be regular visitors to this Funk Zone restaurant.\n\nOh, and by the way, the food was excellent. Delicious stuffed fried olives, wonderful scallops and fish. Wonderfully presented. \n\nLove this place. Thank you for such a festive and fun time.","3638":"Honestly one of the worst meals I have ever paid for.  We had the warm rainbow carrots which were bizarre, the bone marrow which was under cooked and gross and the dungeness crab risotto which was so saltly it was enedible, we had to send it back.  Ever dish was completely over complicated to the point of losing all initial flavor.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the server was very polite and attentive and took the crap risotto off the bill when we told her how awful it was.","3639":"What an amazing place. The food was fabulous, service was a 10!!!! It was our anniversary and my wife's birthday. They gave us desert on the house. What's treat, afterwords walked to the beach and watched the fireworks . Thank you for making our day so special.","3640":"This place has great food but spotty service. First time was amazing second time was crap. After leaving a poor tip on the second trip, due to poor service, we were approached by our server with a aggressive attitude asking what they did wrong. This in my opinion was inappropriate because regardless of tip out you should not approach your customer and call them out in a defensive angry tone.","3641":"This was one of the best meals I've had and the portions are amazing. The waitress was nice enough to let my friends know they wouldn't be able to split a whole chicken , so they ordered half and it was still too much. The salads are fresh and colorful. We loved everything we ate and the cocktails that were made with Cutler's (a vodka we've never heard of but was so smooth) we were looking for it again.\nWe will be back!","3642":"the lark was once a great place. its really gone down hill, from the service to the food quality. every year- its been less and less that we go. this year I have only gone once. \n\nsad because i really use to like it. not anymore. \n\nexpensive with so many options where to spend- i rather go spend my 300 buck dinners somewhere else.","3643":"Beautiful restaurant in a hip part - Funk Zone -  of Santa Barbara. Worth a visit. Our waiter was so\/so. None of the food was bad. We like variety and had the waiter help us pick. All of the dishes had a very similar Brazilian or maybe Jamaican flavor.  We were kind of tired of it after the appetizer and salads. Then too full for the last entree. We asked the waiter to pull it, but he said the kitchen had already started cooking. I doubt it, as we waited 30 minutes. That kind of bugged us as we were full, don't really like wasting food and staying in a hotel isn't conducive to leftovers.  Drinks are fantastic.  Go for the scene. Order light.  Beautiful place.","3644":"The Lark is really as good as it gets. Great atmosphere and right in the middle of the funk zone. The food was amazing. We had the cheese fritters, burrata, deviled eggs, crispy brussel sprouts and the Pork Chop and I would order them all again.","3645":"Very busy and lively place. I was surprised to find this restaurant so busy on a Wednesday evening. It appears to be local favorite with a nice cocktail and wine selection. The deviled eggs were great and the cheese plate was also very good.","3646":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants here in Santa Barbara.  I can't even remember how many times I've been here but all I can say is I've never had anything that I didn't like. \n\nService is excellent. Our server is very knowledgeable and was helpful with all of our questions. The ambiance was good with elegant decorations and romantic lighting inside and out. Noise level is moderate but not bothersome. Be sure to make reservation especially Friday and Saturday nights as this place gets really busy during those times. \n\nThe food is of course exceptional.  It is served family  style so you get to share the dish with others in your group. Must haves are their Brussels sprouts, oysters in a half shell with grapefruit pur\u00e9e, and their duck confit. But seriously, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose.  It's really that amazing! The food here is a little pricey however you get your money's worth! \n\nI always go home satisfied after eating at The Lark and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a really good food experience.","3647":"This place and food is a dream come true \nEvery bite my wife and I took were heavenly we didn't know that vegetables can taste so meaty and so delicious. We had the Brussel sprouts was amazing to start with, than the roasted roasted cabbage and to finalize the beef short ribs","3648":"Came by after walking the dog. Heard it was so cool, and it is. Decor is spot on (think Santa Monica chic). They asked if we had reservations and pretended they were worried, but it was early and NOT crowded. We were able to sit outside with the dog. We had cocktails that were inventive and good. Several small plates, which were hard to manage on small, wobbly tables (but very cute tables). The popcorn was delish, and all the menu items we tried were good, plus the napkins, silverware, plates were all darling (see decor). \nThe place filled up as we ate, so come early if you don't reserve. \nConclusion: \nIt's going through the SB Honeymoon. Darling place with high prices. We noted that we could have had a dinner at the new, lush El Encanto for a little more $ and had a lot more haute cuisine. \nWe liked the Lark, but we'll probably not go there unless showing houseguests from out of town something new.","3649":"We went last night (Friday) and the place was incredibly noisy. My husband and I still find each other interesting and like to talk, but that was out of the question. \nWe started with the Asparagus salad which was a special, half with cooked asparagus, and half with shaved raw. It was very good.\nFollowed by the crispy roasted brussel sprouts with medjool date, garum, sesame and lime, recommended by the table next to us. That to me was the best thing on the menu. We then shared the roasted beet salad which was nice.\nI had the mussels which were also nice, but a bit short on mussels and too much bread. My husband had the Branzino but thought there was far too much of the garbanzos as they were mealy.\nAll in all, it's a nice place, but certainly not the \"incredible food\" place people had been telling us about. Tonight we are trying Downeys after 6 years and are hoping for quiet, intimate conversation and terrific food, but I would go just for the quiet ambience.","3650":"In the process of dinner and I am never one to write reviews. \nBut man, this place is EPIC!!!\n\nIt's so delicious. Greg our waiter is incredibly knowledgeable. He truly is a wonderful waiter and we are enjoying our dinner to the max. \n\nCocktails are to die for. The ribs are amazing. The Brussels sprouts I need in my life daily. \n\nSo, this place is one i will come black to regularly!!","3651":"I've been to The Lark  twice now. The first time I went we ordered  all the wrong things, except for the panzanella salad- SO good! Everything else was just mehh (deviled eggs, olives, sliders and the liver) The atmosphere, however was awesome! Great lighting, and beautiful interior decorations with great details. The service was good too. You could tell  they were really trying to do a good job. My Second experience with the food was a complete 180. We ordered the Chicken and Pork dish- those were just plain delicious! Full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The service was also great- we didn't have a reservation and we got seated right away by the friendly hostesses. I'll be back- next time I'll try to sit at the bar or the communal table.","3652":"Hands-down the best restaurant in Santa Barbara. The food is out of this world. Amazing atmosphere. Very nice and professional staff. Fun place.","3653":"Our waitress was good but the food was surprisingly very bad. Not sure if they were just having an off night but I've been feeling sick since dinner last night. The crispy brussel sprouts were drenched in oil..barely ate them. The lamb pappardelle was ok...I've definitely had better. The skirt steak was flavorless and dry so we sent it back. Only 1\/3 menu items were edible and at that, not even great. Best part of my meal was the glass of wine.","3654":"A friend in Dallas recommended the Lark when I told her I was vacationing in Santa Barbara.  It was wonderful. Lovely atmosphere and service was excellent. We sat on the patio outside, enjoying a bottle of local wine, the brussel sprouts small plate and the ribeye steak which was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  Overall one of the best meals we had!","3655":"Really want to give this place five stars, but we have had such varied service each time we have come that I just can't.  I really like their management.  Have dealt with them to arrange a large event.  They are professional, easy to work with, and go out of their way.  The large event we had felt like we didn't have enough food, but our waitress, Mel, went out of her way to get the drinks we wanted.  When I went on another night, before the event to check it out, we had a terrible server.  Although it wasn't crowded and was chilly he was hesitant to have the heaters near us lit.  I think perhaps since they have increased in popularity, some of the service training has fallen through the cracks.  Just a reminder to the staff might help.\nThe food we had was delicious.  We loved the salads, hamachi appetizer, and duck wings. Overall, enjoyed this place but am worried about their service.","3656":"The service was great and we were super excited to be there but we were pretty disappointed with the food. \n\nLet's start with what we liked... Our favorites were the fresh oysters, Brussels sprouts, and goat pasta. All were extremely delicious and addicting. You can tell right away that what you're eating is super fresh. I would order each of those again. \n\nWe were disappointed with the persimmon salad and the octopus. The salad barely had any persimmon in it and the greens were way too spicy. I felt like they were very distracting from the rest of the plate and it was. Competing with the sauce that was grossly sweet and smokey. The octopus was cooked to perfection but there was way too much spice on it. The habanero was far too spicy and was actually very distracting. I ordered octopus so I could enjoy octopus and I could barely eat it. \n\nAlso there was an extra smokey flavor that was very overwhelming. I could understand liquid smooth on chicken, but not on a salad or in octopus. \n\nI like this place and I think it had a lot of potential, but they should really tone down the flavors they are using g.","3657":"Walked in without reservations late on a Saturday night.  Our wait time was longer than the quoted wait time, and the staff had trouble ascertaining how much longer we'd have to wait...but at some point, we were seated out on the warmed patio on a lovely late spring night.  The restaurant was still very much busy at around 10PM.\nDon was our server for the night, and got waters and drink orders stat.  We were welcomed with fresh popped lime popcorn to snack on before ordering.  The popcorn was delightful and a nice way of getting the palate awake for dinner.\nCocktails are meticulously prepared here.  Lots of fresh herbs and flowers to help accentuate the flavors.  They change their menu on a regular basis.\nThe pimento cheese toasts are covered with some dressed greens.  A nice foil to the spiced cheese mixture atop grilled bread.  The charred broccolini had fried and shaved sunchokes and burrata.  The Farmers' Market Vegetables plate had roasted beets of various colors dressed with a light vinaigrette with shavings of carrots, candy cane radish, squash blossoms, and carrot tops.  The roasted chicken had nice crisp skin, chicken cracklins, roasted fingerlings, and dressed greens.  The pan sauce and dressing added a nice acidic touch.  The Hanger steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and included grilled shishito peppers, asparagus, puffed wild rice, and an onion sauce.\nThe wine we had paired with the meat courses was a bit on the tannic side.  \nThey surprised me with a house dessert for my birthday.  A small Pavlova filled with a thick lemon custard topped with a strawberry.  It was easily the best lemon curd\/custard I've ever had.\nService was on point.  Refills and food came without request or much pause between courses.  I can see why this place is so popular.","3658":"This was my favorite restaurant in town when they first opened but it has taken a turn. The half chicken originally had subtle flavoring and great sides and now has too sweet BBQ sauce with too peppery polenta and okra. They no longer have their flat iron steak (or any steak). The pork belly was 95% fat and inedible. And the brussel sprouts charred beyond recognition. The salads were always a high point but there seems to be less options now (used to have a kale chopped salad that was amazing). Hopefully they can get back to some basics for us less adventurous eaters not in the mood for bone marrow, hamachi or octopus.","3659":"We had cocktails and dinner with another couple last week for the first time.  The concept is to order individual plates off the menu to share as a table. The food was adventuresome and well done. The cocktails were disappointing. My wife had a Manhattan which came in a very small cordial glass. My Martini glass had a larger in diameter base than the portion holding the drink hence the portions of alcohol were quite small for the price. The service was OK.  The food is good, the bar disappointing.","3660":"We were not in Santa Barbara for more than ten minutes before multiple groups of strangers said the Lark was the finest eating establishment in Santa Barbara. We could not resist finding out for ourselves and were extremely happy with the result. Place is obviously an institution, there was a long wait and reservations a must. Once we sat, Bridgett took care of us and we all had a splendid time ordering and eating way too much food. \n\nMy girl's wine was great. They kindly gave us champagne when we indicated we were on our honeymoon. Very classy of them, not expected but seriously appreciated. The champagne was actually really really good. \n\nWe had their spiced popcorn complimentary taster, delicious. We ordered the carrots appetizer dish - stellar. We got the wedge salad and my girl said it was the best she'd ever had. I thought it was pretty frigging great. By the time the butternut squash entree came out, we were both already struggling to eat more. I didn't know quinoa could have such flavor until eating this dish. We were so full, we barely made a dent and of course we were waiting for the final champion dish, their bar burger. \n\nI don't say this lightly - it was the best burger I ever had. I am obsessed with cheeseburgers (aren't we all) and seriously this unseated a two-year reigning champion burger who lives in Bushwick. \n\nWe were blown away our check was under $100, you can't eat that well in NY for under $100. From a snooty foodie brat who learnt in Brooklyn how to eat all classy and shyte, this place is amazing. You should go.","3661":"We were given a recommendation by our hotel concierge. Very tough to get full if you are a vegetarian. No premium vodka. The appetizer was great. Brie with crackers. Amazing vibe and beautiful hip atmosphere. Went to another place after to have dinner. Service was adequate. Good place for wine drinkers, which we're not.","3662":"It doesn't get any better than this in Santa Barbara. Kindest staff, most delectable food. Try the lamb ribs, duck wings, and Brussels sprouts. Love the commitment to sourcing local and sustainable food and wish more restaurants would do so!!","3663":"The food is 5 stars, no doubt about it.  The service can use a little work.  You seriously need a reservation; this place is so popular.  The decor\/atmosphere is amazing, inside and out.  They have done a fantastic job with the aesthetics.  The menu is simple and family style.  They have the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had.  Those, and the shishito peppers would be a must order every time I eat here.  If you're visiting Santa Barbara, you HAVE to eat here.  People watching is also amazing.  You will definitely have a good time here.  Great cocktails too.","3664":"It's been a while since a restaurant has made me feel so satisfied. I loved everything about my experience here. The location is great\/convenient, tucked between bars\/restaurants in the funk zone. The restaurant vibes are laidback, but professional and the decor is very cozy\/earthy. I sound like an asshole talking like this, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and I wish I could convey how comfortable\/well taken care of I felt.\n\nOur server, who reminded me of a shorter Tony Parker, did a great job of explaining the menu and made sure to let us know when to stop ordering. Since the plates are meant to be shared, we almost went way overboard with our orders. Everything we got, though, was delicious. The brussels sprouts are perfect and crispy and the duck liver mousse is the fanciest I've ever seen. I was expecting to be thrown some shit in a jar and a baguette, but this was really well-presented and all the ingredients worked well together. For our main course, we were feeling super Southern and got some pork dish with cornbread and greens. It was huge, but so perfectly cooked. \n\nThe drinks here are also delicious. The boy got the Old Aztec which reminded me of an Old Fashioned (I guess...not much of a cocktail drinker), but much, much better. The beer selection is perfectly curated. I ended up choosing a saison on draft and it was so good, I made that my drink for the night. \n\nAnyway, I wish I could visit this place more often. I haven't found a restaurant here in LA that does quite what The Lark does for me. My only complaint is that other waiters, not our server for the night, kept stopping by and taking our plates prematurely. Like, come on, I wasn't done with that yet. You just walked away with one oyster left on the plate!","3665":"My experience at the Lark was fantastic. Our server Talia was polite, knowledgable and seemed really passionate about the food. We ordered the famous Brussel Sprouts, and I've never had them like this, delicious! The half roasted chicken with BBQ glaze was prepared to perfection. We finished our meal with the Pavlova. What a wonderful experience!","3666":"Bill was a great server, loved our time at The Lark. A must try. Brussels sprouts, wedge salad and lamb belly.","3667":"A beautiful setting, it both succeeds in being luxurious and homey. I haven't eaten here much but I've been curious to try more.","3668":"Yes Yelpers, you were right. \n Everything from flavored popcorn ( instead of bread) to chocolate pot de creme was terrific. \n\nVibrant setting with friendly, attentive service..\nI really liked the \"shared plates\" concept ( think of ordering and sharing dishes at a Chinese restaurant ). \nThe wedge salad was a work of art..\nGrilled Brussels sprouts were so flavorful. \nWe tried the Mary's chicken and the short ribs for our main courses.\nSuper nice waitress. \n\nI guess my only dig would be that the wine prices were steep. I think they have a liberal corkage fee policy to bring your own. Please check their website for details. \n\nThe doctor (Notorious MD) would proclaim this \" dining operation\" a success.","3669":"This place is so dang good!! I would definitely make reservations if you are planning to go though because it gets really busy and it looked like the only place they sat walk-ins on busy nights was at one long communal table that was packed with people. We waited about 2 hours to get seated, but once we did it was worth the wait.\n\nThey seated us on the patio next to a fire pit, which was perfect because it was chilly outside. It provided a nice ambiance as well. We started with the Fried Olives and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, both of which were delicious. I'm not usually a big fan of brussel sprouts, but the flavor in these was insane. So good! Then we had the Little Gems Wedge... which was AMAZING. If you are a fan of wedge salads, you have to try this. You won't be sorry. We also tried the Citrus Cured Scottish Salmon and loved it. You basically can't go wrong at this place. Everything was delicious. I wish we lived closer.. if so, we'd go all the time.","3670":"Impeccable service by our server Bill and outstanding food. Everything we chose was delicious beginning w the yummy popcorn to the cheese board to the Brussel sprouts to the beet salad and then to our entrees. We chose the scallops and the pork belly. Both cooked perfectly and tasted divine. We ordered three desserts because we couldn't decide. The lemon fritters w blueberry ice cream rocked it! The cocktails were just as delicious. All our choices were wonderful  and we will go back for more! Couldn't have asked for a more thorough server. His explanation of all the menu items was great and he was totally excited about telling us! Refreshing! An outstanding restaurant and the place itself is so darling. We sat next to a fireplace outside and they brought a heater over to us to keep us warm. Little white lights overhead and around us. Everyone there so hospitable and friendly. The ambiance is great. A very popular spot obviously and worth the visit. Make reservations because the place was busy on a Saturday evening.","3671":"Good but too busy. I asked for a check over twenty minutes ago. The food is good. But it's way overpriced for what it is so...... Too bad it's not the Bay Caf\u00e9 anymore.","3672":"It looks fantastic, the atmosphere is great and the food is solid. The menu can be a little too much on the experimental side. I'd prefer they just do the really great dishes really well. \n\nA little pricey, which is known upfront, but in a group, for a good ambiance, it's a great choice in a great location.","3673":"Hands down best restaurant ever! From the amazing food & menu choices, the attentive staff, easy valet parking, awesome atmosphere - everything about it made for a perfect evening. Oysters on the half shell with a bit of grapefruit, flat iron streak that melted like butter - terrific menu!","3674":"We loved The Lark. The Brussels sprouts were amazing. We could not stop eating them. It's a must order. The service was on point. They welcomed our dog on the patio.","3675":"One of the best restaurants ever! We went last night for the third time and each time I leave, I can't wait to come back. The atmosphere is always relaxed, the staff are always hip, but lovely and the food, the glorious food!! It's all so good, I can't pick a favorite..... Starting with the insane popcorn! Octopus, pork belly, Brussels sprouts, Mary's chicken.... Hmm, I just don't know which reigns supreme. What is great is that you can have them all with their sharing type meals, so actually I don't have to pick! YEAH!!! Can't wait till the create a cookbook! Love The Lark and dreaming of the next visit!","3676":"The food and service was divine!  All so fresh and unique!  Need to return and remember to make reservations. Ended up at a communal table and had a blast!","3677":"Just go! It's awesome, very casual with great Texas-inspired Food. Sit at the Community Table, it's fun!","3678":"Located in the funk zone this is a top restaurant pick for me when visiting Santa Barbara. Some pretty darn excellent food.  I find the staff to be a mix of bored and affected and really great. So, ignore the ones with an ego, and enjoy the staff that really want to serve up a great experience. The Brussel sprouts are one of my top picks. All the food we tried was great. And, for dessert. The donut plate was perfect. Great cocktails too. I highly recommend.","3679":"I am a writer who lives in Italy part of each year and travel a great deal with my designer wife and we love great food, did I say love. And so it is a pleasure when a place you have repeatedly visited gets better and better and did I say better. The kitchen at Lark is evolving to the good to great and they at last have some outrageous deserts. Last night we had the Warm Mexican Chocolate cookies with Ancho Chile and Creme Fraiche Ice Cream. It was a dream!!! And we are still mouth dreaming. Thank you Lark, for making my home town of Santa Barbara even more of a dream!","3680":"Fiance and I stumbled upon this place while taking a stroll. As luck would have it, a couple of bar tops were open, otherwise walking in on Saturday night is a 3 hour wait! I had the bartender make me a delicious mocktail as we snacked on the addicting popcorn. The bartenders were super attentive and we didn't even have to prompt them. The food is superb. We had the lamb ribs which just eased off the bones, and the steak was accompanied by eggplant and leeks. Unusual and unforgettable!","3681":"3 stars for ambiance. food lacked, unless chef didn't know the salt shaker fell in accidently.\nOn my list, but only for drinks.","3682":"Read where the Lark is in the funk zone.  Not sure what that means, but it must be good. Open Table was a waste of time, so we went without reservations.  They are always busy. They found a table in the patio next to a much needed heater.  The service was much beyond excellent.  Our server was well informed, timely, and attentive.  Dropped my napkin; voila she replaced it.  Wait staff came and went when needed.  Food.  They has a different concept.  All orders are shared.  We started with Brussel sprouts and drink orders.  They have an interesting variety of cocktails, wines, and craft bears.  Very extensive. From the farm section of the menu their squash, presented beautifully and excellent as well.  The main entree was  Texas gulf coast red fish that came with an interesting medley of veggies, sausage in a  interesting sauce.  Didn't have room for dessert, but there are some interesting choices.  Parking is a little tight; valet parking is necessary.  Great dining experience.","3683":"Make reservations in advance for this place. The food and service are great. The crispy brussell sprouts are fantastic. Unfortunately they are deep fried then tossed in their flavoring, so they don't count as a veggie.  They are cooked perfectly. Could have eaten more. \nAll of the dishes are served family style\nThe pork belly tastes great but it is fatty. This was the least favorite dish. The crispy lamb and pappardelle is really tasty. The bone marrow beef cheeks are rich tasting and melts in your mouth.  The veggies served with this are bitter. The cocktails are great and strong. A good variety of drink options. Definitely coming back to eat here","3684":"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. I consider myself to be an incredibly picky eater with 'fine dining'. It's the spoiled taste buds of LA talking. I want things to be phenomenal. My BF made reservations here for us, and I'm so glad we came. We ordered the steak, the spanish octopus, and the hazelnut ice cream sandwich, and each thing blew my tastebuds away. But the spanish octopus!!! THE SPANISH OCTOPUS!!! It was the best thing ever. BEST.","3685":"Loved this place, our second time here over the last year and it was great both times.  The duck confit was incredible, along with everything our water recommended.  Definitely recommend making a reservation as it can be very busy and a long wait.","3686":"Our friends were visiting from Indiana for their 10th Wedding Anniversary, so we had dinner here. I had told the hostess about this special event, and they greeted us with a complimentary champagne toast which I thought was lovely.  We came hungry and did some serious damage. We started with the brussels sprouts - awesome, the half cheese board - so good, enjoy with a nice wine from their ample selection, the wedge salad - one of the best I've had and it's a fave of mine, the braised lamb and gnocchi which was a table favorite, the scallops which were MY favorite, the hangar steak which we all thought was perfectly cooked but the flavors didn't do much for us, and we finished with the short ribs which made us all want to lick the plate. We didn't, because we needed to have dessert. We had the blondie which hubby loved and I just liked okay (too sweet for me, but that's me) and the pot de creme which is probably the best dessert I've ever had. Service was impeccable. Owner made several passes by our table to ask how everything was, I always like to see an involved owner! I cannot wait to take our next visitors here.  Terrific ambiance, just a perfect evening for us all.","3687":"We loved getting there early, eating outside. Had about an hour to enjoy a quieter ambiance before the place filled up. We ordered four dishes for three people and it was too much food. The least expensive red wine was delicious. The service was attentive. We left happy!","3688":"Delicious food that always is a crowd pleaser. While it can be a bit pricey, it is a worthwhile treat. Make sure to have a reservation. My favorite is their veggie sandwich.","3689":"Great service, food, ambience, wine list and location! Food is creative, well-made, beautifully presented and everything we tried was excellent. Highly recommend! If you'd like a private table, reservations suggested otherwise the community table was good.","3690":"Ok...here's the deal. I couldn't even wait until the end of the meal to write this review. \n\nWe ordered a lot. We ordered seconds of most. The wine recommendation was amazing. \n\nI usually write a lengthy review. Tonight I am making the following recommendation: eat here tonight; eat here often. \n\nHuge praise from a local SB self proclaimed foodie.","3691":"Great concept, sharing plates ensure everyone experiences the brilliantly balanced flavours and fresh local ingredients. Service from Suize was exceptional. Overall a A+ night.","3692":"The food is all very unique with lots of different influences (southern, east coast, Californian). The atmosphere is lovely. There's really not a bad seat in the whole restaurant. The portions are very generous so bring your appetite!","3693":"The Lark is best American food in Santa Barbara,also great service and location. Great place to go for dinner.","3694":"Love this place. The ambience is wonderful. The food was really good (for the most part) We loved the Brussel sprouts, porchetta with burrata  and the dessert- butter cake with corn ice cream was AMAZING! The half chicken entr\u00e9e was just ok... I think it is brined which resulted in a rubbery texture and no crispy skin... boo! But we will be back to try some of their other offerings. The scallops looked really good!","3695":"There's really only good things I can say about this place! If your looking for high quality, local, amazing food this is the place. We've been here about 4 times and it's always just exceptional! The customer service, appetizers, salad! Just everything is sooo good :) I could eat here everyday and not get sick of the food.","3696":"Bad service bad people bad food\n\nIf you are going to spend money at lark don't.\nI came in an talk to the host telling me that the wait was 3 weeks. Lol so I decided to sit on the bar which everyone pays for a tiny space. I had two people tell me that I ruined their night because I order a pimento cheese plate to eat, I tell the bar tender Sarah we are next since we have all of this food waiting for us and instead of been polite and caring she said \"first sit first serve\". She hold my food for at list 10 minutes while it was cold. That's disgrace. It's bad and unsatisfactory what was she thinking playing with people money like that. \nI have already investing at list a 100 at the restaurant. Well I get the hangar steak where is the hangar steak is it ok for restaurant to not give you what you want? It's broccoli it's a pound of broccoli with 5 pieces of steak on top 20\nDollars, the hamachi bad  plated too why would you hide the main ingredients with a bunch of celery and segments. If you are paying for a plate that's expensive and you have at list 40 people working in a kitchen to put element together for food, are you about to fill the plate with some stuff to only overwhelm your palate and not enjoy the simplicity of a dish then it's sad because it's not an adventure to eat at this place but a torture from beginning to end. Sad and overwhelming","3697":"This place was such a fantastic place! My friends and I stumbled upon here actually looking for a different place ha! We were so glad to eat here though as the food and wine were delicious. We shared which let us order a variety of things to try and so glad we did! It was great eating outside on this gorgeous evening. Looking forward to coming back!","3698":"Had a fantastic dinner here with my two year old and husband. \nMy daughter was very happy with her pizza and I found the staff to be very helpful with her. They had other options for children (no menu just ask). \nOur meal was fantastic- we first had the deviled eggs and Brussel sprouts. Both definitely impressed. We followed with the pear and burrata salad which was wonderful and could have fed a third person. The star was definitely the crab gnocchi - rich creamy and melted in our mouths. It was very balanced and the crab was complimented perfectly by the sauce. I would definitely recommend the meal.  Our waiter was very helpful- especially when it came to ordering the right amount for the meal. We appreciated the feedback and found his advice to help make our meal great. Thankful we don't live closer because we would be spending a lot of money here :)","3699":"Incredible food. All seasonal menu. Very pleasing to the eye & the pallet. Awesome, hip atmosphere. Patio warm at night, comfortable even on a cool evening. Great staff. Overall wonderful experience.","3700":"I really like this place! Wifey and I went there for dinner and thought it was great. So, we had the carrots, scallops & octopus. Everything was so yummy but the wife thought they were a lil slow. Waiting on the dessert now and if it's anything like the dinner I'm going to love it.","3701":"This place is off the hook! the lark is unbelievable! The food is fantastic. The decor in this restaurant is amazing and the service is on point! Def recommend this place to everyone!","3702":"Beautiful.  Awesome food. Sexy environment and a fun eating experience to all share.  It was perfect and you absolutely will not be disappointed.  I was looking at all reviews to find restaurants for our vacation and this was the best!","3703":"The staff at this restaurant is professional, polite, pleasant and hard-working across the board, from the valet parking to the reception\/reservationists, waiters and bussers. The food was creative and beautifully presented. The balance of the dishes was a little odd. The hamachi crude was basically a melon salad with three small but fresh and delicious pieces of hamachi. The steak \"platter\" was mostly roasted broccoli with three small well-prepared pieces of steak. This restaurant is warmly decorated and stylish. It is also VERY LOUD! Obviously, popular and trendy. Great people watching. But LOUD and BUSY. A high energy experience. Well-worth a visit...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g33045-d4702782-r318117607-The_Lark-Santa_Barbara_California.html#","3704":"Perfect night out with friends at the Lark last night!  The food was amazing- we ordered a bunch of different appetizers and entrees and shared.   All were delicious- I especially loved the arugula\/strawberry salad and the Branzino.  Even though the place was packed, our servers were very attentive and informative.  This is definitely one of my new \"favorites\"!","3705":"I was so excited to be here with my friends . Great ambience and people watching . But that is where the good stuff ended . \nWe sat in uncomfortable seats for food that was very  spicy . And I love spicy food but the dipping sauce with the fried green tomatoes was inedible . The customer service was great and they took the food away with no questions asked .\nThe few small plates that we had all had a element of heat that did not blend and seemed forced . \nMaybe not my day but after all what I heard about Lark I was disappointed .","3706":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner and there was a lively crowd and overall good vibe. Our waitress was lovely and she was patient in accommodating my vegan requests. My husband had the Wagyu- which he says is the best he's ever had! I had the Winter pears salad and it was delectable- such unique flavors and so refreshing, wish I could have this everyday. \nThe Brussel sprouts were also soooo amazing, crunchy and flavorful, yum!","3707":"We enjoyed our diner at The Lark a lot. A great ambiance, very relaxed and modern. Food was excellent all the way.  Service was very good. We will definitely be back.","3708":"Awesome food and atmosphere!  Funky and classy in the Funk Zone- the beet salad and pork shank were delicious, and the service was great- very attentive and friendly.","3709":"Average ... That's all.. The food was ok, the drinks were not that good but the upside was the huge space .. The lark is divided by their wine bar, outside patio and the sister restaurant that had more \"fast\" casual food. Lucky penny. If I would go back there I would DEFINITELY eat at lucky penny.  \nThe big downside is the wait. We weren't able to get a reservation but we were seated at the bar where we could order from the full menu while waiting for a table. We actually ended up dining at the bar since it took over 2,5 hours for us to get a table. \n\nI understand the high rating since this place is one of the more trendy restaurants in Santa Barbara but compared to restaurants in Los Angeles it only gets 3 stars from me","3710":"The atmosphere is vibrant with moody warm lighting. The bartenders make tasty drinks packed with youth and timelessness. It's great. The food always changes. The staff is attractive. Everything feels clean. The food is delicious. Everything feels home cooked, in a professional way. I want to come here every day.","3711":"What an amazing find. Personable service without being intrusive. Food is California infused, with the local Santa Barbara farming too.\nDecor & ambiance very warm & welcoming.\nVibrant bar scene too!\n\nA new haunt has now been created, for us!\nFunky row, is officially rocking.","3712":"This is a follow up to my review on 10\/17\/2016. I'm completely taken back at the level of interest The Lark takes in customer satisfaction! In the several reviews I've posted over the years whether good or offering constructive criticism I've never received any contact in reply from the business until this time. Laura of The Lark reached out to me the following day! Laura addressed the experience I had. I have since been back to The Lark and had a perfect dining experience. This has been and will remain my favorite restaurant of all time. Thanks to everyone at The Lark for your attention to detail, your appealing atmosphere, and for being friendly and helpful.","3713":"Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday at The Lark and really enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. Delicious food, friendly staff, and upbeat environment. Next visit to Santa Barbara will definitely include a stop at The Lark!","3714":"My review may read a bit oxymoron-ish...so beautiful ambiance, 1st server was superb-food fresh & appetizing, but while our replacement server brought our food...we waited for our Brussel sprouts and food got cold. So we proceeded to eat and asked \"Is it normal to wait for our Sprouts?\" Honestly It could have been an innocent oversight...but it's the little things that I notice. I heard about this place, I've been to so many great places and I have to give LARK 3.25 Stars\n\nNote: I so wanted a better experience...\n\n-Blessings","3715":"Came here last weekend with a group of friends for my fianc\u00e9s bday. We got there 5 minutes after they opened and there were already a lot of people there! I was worried because there were no reservations available that we would not get to eat. Luckily they had some open seating and told us we had until 7:30 as they had to honor a reservation. That gave us plenty of time! We ordered and ate family style. We had 6 people and got 7 plates and we were all stuffed! Ok so we had the Brussels sprouts....I'm not always a big fan but these were AMAZING! They live up to the hype! We also had the wedge salad that had some bomb blue cheese (I also really don't like blue cheese but this was just amazing) then we had shrimp, gnocchi, spare rib (looked like it was only cooked to medium rare and usually I don't eat it like that but I tried and this was soooo good), chicken and grits, and lamb ribs. I'm still dreaming about that chicken and grits! So good! The only thing I didn't enjoy too much was the lamb ribs, not too much meat. Guess I'm just used to pork or beef ribs. \n\nWe also got different desserts. The best by far was the cheesecake puffs...so creamy and good! Didn't much like the tres leche chocolate cake. The merengue was a little to tart. The donut was good as well! \n\nIt is expensive...so be prepared! But it was an experience and a great one at that!","3716":"Food was delicious.  Very friendly service.  Little too heavy on the salt on most items.  Otherwise i would have given 5 stars.","3717":"What a wonderful restaurant, we loved the decor and the use of repurposed materials. The staff was incredible, we had Norman waiting on us and he is great, made sure to check on our food allergies and a wealth of information on the dishes and drinks. The menu is full of great options and I'm sure we'll come back to try the dishes we didn't get to try. Thank you for such a beautiful dining experience and helping us celebrate our anniversary","3718":"I have no words. I am thoroughly impressed with the food from this genius chef. The way he amalgamated the flavors has my palate in a dance. I'm only in Santa Barbara for two days and I am seriously considering coming back tomorrow for dinner. Kudos.","3719":"Great surroundings but foods are not that good as expected. Maybe cuz waiting a week to reserve and having high expectation on it made me a little bit disappointed. Overall it's good. The sauce in oysters I really like the apple flavor and lemon. Duck liver. Personally, Ribs, Crispy Brussels, Tomato salad with plums and Caramelized scallops are too salty that made me trunk almost three cups of tea.","3720":"Our first visit to the Lark was amazing.....great food, great service.  In so much, we HAD to go back.  They have (like many others) a seasonal farm to table approach in their menu.....but, we were surprised to see the menu completed changed.  So the amazing Panzanella salad and pork belly sliders that we were craving were gone.  I ordered the Kale salad (thinking the more delicate baby kale) and got a plate of huge pieces of kale.  Sorry Lark, I felt like a cow.  It was so green, I had to return it.  I ordered the beet salad....the Hibiscus dressing was very tart and the Burrata very rubbery.  My husband ordered the pork belly and it was overdone and a tad rubbery as well.  The service was so so and we had to hunt down the waitress to pay our bill.  Oh, and a glass of wine $15.00....\n\nGoing again?  Nope.","3721":"Somehow I found myself at all the hip places this past week while eating in SB. The Lark is certainly one of them. The food is delicious and presented artfully.  We had stopped by around 5 PM and inquired about same night reservations. They told us 8:15 was the earliest for two and we passed. After meeting friends for drinks, we were back on our own and hungry. It was now 7:30. We stopped back at the Lark and now the wait was until 9:30. So we opted for the communal table. It totally worked out. We got two seats and our service was prompt and friendly. Only down side to the communal table is you have to sit next to someone whose manners might not be up to snuff.\n\nWe started with the brussell sprouts and fried green tomatoes. Both excellent choices. Order them as you won't be disappointed.  The marinated and grilled hangar steak was very good and filling. My wife got a vegetarian dish that isn't standing out in my mind and she was very happy too. The portions are very big and if you're worried about paying more for food art than food substance, don't. You get both here. Also, compared to someplace like Black Sheep, your money goes farther here IMHO.","3722":"I didn't know what to expect from the food at this restaurant, but I was in for a surprise.  Ordered the ribs which was cooked to perfection with the meat falling off the bones.  I was deciding over the pork shoulders or the house chicken for the second course.   The waitress recommended the chicken which is the crowd favorite.  I don't normally order chicken at restaurants but was so glad I did.  There's tons of flavor and the skin is crispy, complimented by aioli and roasted apricots, greens.  I would definitely revisit the larks when I do go to Santa Barbara again.","3723":"Beautiful atmosphere and great food.\n\nWe ordered a ton of food for our group of six and we kept getting some serious judgment from our waiter who kept asking if we were SURE we didn't want to cancel anything.  I think he was doing it to be considerate, however, so that we wouldn't feel pressured to eat everything we had initially ordered.  \n\nOtherwise, the service was good and the food was stellar.  \n\nWe got the deviled eggs, brussel sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, beets and butternut squash, duck liver mousse, goat confit strozzapreti pasta (basically goat confit on tubular pasta), Spanish octopus, scallops, and the trout.\n\nAll of it was very good; I thought the heirloom tomatoes and beets and butternut squash were too sweet but my friends liked them.  My favs were basically everything else.  \n\nWe also ordered the honey dessert and the ice cream sandwich.  The honey dessert (I forget the actual name) was very unique and tasted almost like a honey panna cotta.  Highly recommend.  They also comped one of the desserts for us because it was my birthday!  I thought that was very nice.  \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place and come here again next time I'm in the area.","3724":"Reservations are a must. Food was great from start to finish. It's all family style which is fun. Good variety across the menu. We left stuffed. \n\nService was professional, knowledgable, and friendly. Go with outside seating if you have the option, especially if the weather is fair.","3725":"The restaurant is cute, it has a romantic ambiance, we waited 1.5 hour on a Saturday because we did not make a reservation however it is definitely worth the wait. There is outdoor patio and indoor seating. The menu is different from time to time as they create dishes based on what's fresh in the season. \n\nWe ordered: \n1) West Coast Oysters On The Half Shell\n2) Olive Oil Roasted Shishito Peppers\n3) Lamb Shank\n4) Duck confit \n\nEach dish is uniquely planted and super fresh \/ delicious! I would definitely come back next time with A reservation.","3726":"A vibrant, fun setting. A well-chosen wine list. Excellent, professional service. A menu full of innovative choices, and a chef willing to respect dietary issues. That sets the table for a terrific dinner. The brussels sprouts are absolutely delicious. The Central Coast Vegetables were fresh, perfectly cooked, and terrific. The roast chicken was perfect.  Go.","3727":"The service from the server and hostess was great, but the food was far off from my taste. It's quite expensive for the portion of food you get, but I would go again to impress a date.","3728":"If you're looking for a busy, apparently trendy but kinda noisy place with really good food and drinks, this place is for you. The apple and lettuce salad was really refreshing, and the the octopus was just amazing : creative and well balanced, the vegetables are almost as good as the octopus itself, definitely a must have ! Also, my revisited old fashioned came up the right way, with a nice unique ice cube, which I appreciate. The service was very good, with a really smiling staff that makes you feel welcomed.","3729":"Great food, great \"hang\". The Brussels are a \"must order! The menu is constantly changing so keep going!","3730":"I have so been waiting for The Lark to open, and I am so impressed with what I had in store for me. Ambiance is hands down the best in town, and more importantly, the food is unlike anything Santa Barbara has to offer! I suggest you try them out, if not for dinner, at least for a glass of wine on the patio .  .  . or 4","3731":"Truly 5 stars.  Creative, fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented.  Service is outstanding.  Ambiance is as good as it gets.  \n\nBrussel sprouts are just amazing and unlike any other preparation I've had.  Scallops are perfect.  Steak was cooked perfectly and of the highest quality. \n\nPrices reflect the quality of ingredients, skilled preparation, and exceptional service. \n\nThis is probably the most popular place in Santa Barbara right now and will be for quite some time.   Absolutely a gem.","3732":"The chef here definitely uses more elements on each plate than I prefer but the preparation is excellent and it all works.  We were there on with about 100 other people and the kitchen didn't miss a beat.  \n\nThe service is excellent and the place has a nice, energetic vibe.  Definitely a place to eat if you are in the area.","3733":"5 stars for all three elements of the ever elusive dining trifecta: atmosphere, food and service. \nI read about The Lark in one of GOOP's newsletter - most of which I delete immediately due to lofty price tags and unattainable standards of human perfection but seeing as Santa Barbara is a frequent destination for me, I had to check it out. I came with a group of 5 on Sunday night thinking there would be room for walk-ins, but the place was packed! Lucky for us the stars were aligned and a last minute cancellation gave us an outdoor table on the gorgeous twinkle-lit patio next to the wrought-iron firepit. So warm and cozy. Beautifully designed.\n\nOur server was fantastic, so gracious, friendly and helpful with recommendations off the menu. You know someone is being honest when they tell you to order LESS food, and I really appreciate sincerity in a server. \n\nNow to the FOOD! The restaurant recommends you order family style so prepare to share and make sure to go with adventurous eaters who share your love of food! Our server told us the brussels sprouts were their signature and I see why! They were roasted in medjool date and had the perfect mix of sweet and salty. The brussels and the pimento cheese rocked as appies. \n\nFor salads we had the Little Gems \"Wedge\" salad (the bacon rocked) and an unbelievable heirloom tomato and stone fruit salads that is a MUST order if it's still on the menu. One of the best salads of simple, local, fresh and perfectly ripe ingredients I've ever had. \nWe had the whole roasted chicken and the tagliatelle as our mains. The tagliatelle, while still delicious, was the least exciting dish of the meal. The chicken, however, was so delicious, roasted perfectly with sweet corn and creamy grits on the side. \n\nTop it of with a delicious cab from Halter Ranch and you have a night for the books (or bring your favorite bottle and pay the $20 corkage fee).","3734":"Trendy tapas spot with a solid menu.  Really fun and well executed small plates. Parking is a challenge but there is a great valet service.   Our waitress was fantastic.  The only reason I gave this a less than perfect 5 stars is because one plate of our order came out super late.  We had already finished eating for 30 minutes and the last plate finally came out.  In addition the last plate was way over seasoned.  The waitress saw we were not eating the plate and she comped the item no questions.  We will be back.","3735":"Came here with a couple of girlfriends and all of us loved this place! The atmosphere and setting is super trendy and great for a group or a dinner date. We started with the brussels sprouts which are the popular starter and they were honestly amazing. I got the steak and the wedge salad, both were so tasty with a lot of flavor. They cook the steak on the rare medium side, which I hesitated because I like medium. However, it tasted so good I didn't mind the pinkish look or texture at all. Loved sitting on the outdoor patio, it's heated so we weren't cold at all, all the tables are candle-lit. The staff were all friendly as well.","3736":"Somebody at a vineyard in Solvang had recommended the place. And we did not wanted to be in SB tourist section of town.\nWe did not make a reservation ( but it's highly recommended) . They were able to seat us right away outside at a cozy little table! Waiter was very helpful and gave us suggestions! Food was excellent, healthy, refreshing and different! Perfect for a romantic dinner date!","3737":"I recently went to dinner at the Lark during a bachelorette party weekend and it was fantastic! They served us a pre-fixe menu because it was a large group, and everything was delicious. The cocktails are fantastic too! I definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu!","3738":"Make a reservation and go!! They have done an amazing job with an old industrial building, it is cozy and rustic yet has gourmet food! All of our choices were delicious especially the Crispy Duck Leg Confit (great depth of flavor). All the  tables were occupied so ambiance was vibrant, very busy and the staff were very attentive. They brought us a blanket to the patio and it was such a great touch.  Make a reservation and treat yourself!","3739":"Great cocktails great atmosphere and simpy amazing food. Straight and to the point keep it simple and they let the ingredients speak for them selves.  Great job chef!!!","3740":"$$$$, but well worth it. Good to go with a small group of foodies who have similar taste\/diet restrictions so that you can share a couple different things. The roast chicken is extremely delicious and filling. The pork belly is my personal favorite. If you can afford this place, it is not to be missed while you're in town, as is their sister restaurant Loquita across the street. If you can't afford it, at least go for an appetizer at one or both, then go get a pizza at their little sister locale, Lucky Penny, right next-door.","3741":"It was just a beautiful yummy night!  We adored are waiter Oscar too. Such a pleasant night. The tomato  salad and the beet salad were off the charts good. I won't order the chicken again just because I want try something different   Brussels sprouts were very good too. Menu could be more varied.","3742":"The Lark is super good. Fast and good service for how busy it was. I highly recommend the ribs if there still on the menu.","3743":"Whoa! This place is serious about its food and it was crazy good. It has this funky, cool atmosphere that is very vibrant. The menu seems limited but it is amazing. We ordered the octopus, the red fish and the chicken. Almost life changing! This place will definitely be on my list when I get back to Santa Barbara. It's a must do. Just be sure to get reservations well in advance. It's a favorite of the locals no matter the night of the week.","3744":"Went for dinner with my family. Very nice casual restaurant but more for young hip crowd rather than family dinning.  The food is good but not great.  Many superior food restaurants in the area.\n\nWe had scallops that were ok but nothing special, flank steak that was bland and pappardelle with spring vegetables that was good but not worth ordering again.\n\nWould I go back, no!","3745":"This restaurant is a must during our Santa Barbara getaways.  One of our favorites in town.  Food, service, drink and atmosphere are all top notch.","3746":"We had dinner at the Lark tonight and it was such a nice experience that I decided to give them 10 stars. Well designed indoor\/outdoor space with a vintage style. Short menu, which usually means good food. We tried panzanella salad, little gem salad, pork belly sliders, rib eye and Mediterranean Bronzino. The food was excellent, and I'm not an easy going guy. The service was outstanding. The cocktails were perfect. Overall an amazing experience. BTW the prices are fair as well.\nThis place is the real deal.","3747":"Amazing food. Our waitress, Mel, totally knocked it out of the park with her great suggestions.","3748":"Well, we went back to The Lark for round 2..And it was the opposite of Round 1 in every way. When we were there for New Years, we had five round of food that were huge portions. This time we had three rounds of food that were all tiny. I always though Family Style meant bigger portions that can be shared with everyone (Bucca di Beppo-ish), but this is more like tapas. \n\nThe salads seem to be really large, but the main courses are quite small. The food was still good, but I just can't quite get over the portion sizes and the prices you pay for them. We'll be back, but it definitely won't be a go-to favorite.","3749":"Delicious dinner!  Made my trip to Santa B\u00e1rbara. I joked with the waitress that I will chase the popcorn they served like a drug addict chases their first high, the popcorn was life changing. I kept asking for more and I most definitely will try to make it. The cocktails were delicious and the duck wings were epic!  I wish I lived closer.","3750":"Did not live up to the hype unfortunately. The restaurant is indeed very nice with good decor and ambiance. We had good service with prompt water refills and clearing of plates. The disappointing part was of the course the most important part: the food.  Everything on the menu sounds amazing but unfortunately that's the best part of it all. The dishes are very ambitious with lots of yummy sounding things going but I found each dish to be underwhelming in flavor and overly salted. \n\nBrussels sprout: tasty but VERY VERY salty. Kind of overpowered the taste of the sprouts \n\nTrout: perfectly cooked fish which was actually very good. However the burre blanc sauce was broken and all of the spices\/seasoning were concentrated on just one piece of romanesco (like it was poured onto the plate there) making those bites overwhelmingly salty :-\/\n\nScallops:  beautiful dish came with a succotash of corn and zucchini that was very tasty. The three scallops were large and well cooked but unfortunately they were COMPLETELY overpowered by a chili paste on top that was (again) overly salty. Scallops are sweet and delicate and you completely lose that when you overpower them like that. Ended up trying to scrape it off, But still a waste of good ingredients (not to mention $40). \n\nOverall the food was meh but for the prices they charge here it really should be above and beyond. The atmosphere is nice but there are other places in SB that serve vastly better food.","3751":"My girlfriend and I the enjoy the hunt for a new great restaurant find. At The Lark, we completely hit the jackpot. Ambiance, food, drinks and service were very enjoyable and memorable. \n\nDriving down from the Bay Area we found The Lark on TripAdvisor and managed to catch an early reservation, parking just in time to catch our table, which seems to be a task from reading other reviews. \n\nThe restaurant has a rustic feel but with very hip elements; a long bar with craft spirits proudly shown on the large back display leads back to a large exterior windowpane with a clear view into the busy kitchen. \n\nService promptly began with seasoned popcorn speckled with grapefruit zest, a carafe of water was left on the table but always attended to. Small things, but they add up to the overall excellent experience. Our server told us about the use of local ingredients and how menu items were meant to be enjoyed as a shared dish, a concept we really enjoy. Also our sever coursed each of our plates, a practice appreciated at a place such as Lark. We noticed the menu also lists the option to send a 6-pack of beer back to the kitchen. After a short thought, we went for it and it wasn't regretted. \n\nI ordered a fruity, zesty blonde beer and my girlfriend just had an iced tea, but she said it was one of the better iced teas she had ever enjoyed. The first course of the kale salad was delicious with its creamy cider dressing, crunchy pepitas and pomegranate seeds, but the warm roasted apple segments put it over the edge to excellent. \nThe same can be said for the duck liver mouse. The creamy smooth mouse with its nutty, gamey taste was perfectly complimented by the salted cashews, warm spiced pears, bitterness of the charred bread and crisp clean crunch of frisee. A glass of the lightly fruity, dry grenache rose paired well with the pate. \n\nBranzino is my favorite fish for reasons reflected in how The Lark plated this dish. The crispy, buttery white fish was plated over a creamy yet tangy barley caper risotto. Also on the dish was a zesty kale and fennel slaw with grapefruit segments.  All the ingredients, which were already enjoyable on their own, came together perfectly and left us both really impressed with our meal.\n\nEven with the portions as large and filling as they seemed, a Tahitian vanilla cookie sandwich was thoroughly enjoyed as well. A spiced caramel sauce garnisheeing the plate was an added surprise of flavor. I was even able to get a great glass of absinthe drip to end out the evening, a quality bar indeed. \n\nThroughout service, ingredients of each dish were proudly described by a staff member bringing food to the table. It's a practice I've done working in restaurants myself and it really adds an intimate connection between the chef and his guests. \n\nThe final bill was nearly $130 for the two of us but included three drinks (an $18 absinthe cocktail) as well as the $12 6-pack for our chefs doing all the awesomeness.  For the experience, food quality and portions, we enjoyed ourselves as if it was a $250 bill. \n\nOkay, if I have to say one bad thing about this place to bring pause to my gushing, it is that the bar and communal table were way too close together and made for a challenging trip to the bathroom, but thats my stretch to find some flaw. \n\nThe Lark is a great model for what a modern American restaurant can be, creative yet approachable, quality yet affordable. Certainly looking forward to our next chance to enjoy such a great meal.","3752":"The Lark was an overnight train passing through Santa Barbara on its way between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nLark is a restaurant in Santa Barbara's funk zone that serves fine cuisine from farm and ocean fresh ingredients.\n\nThe outdoor seating and indoor seating options are both great options. We sat next to one of the gas for pits outside which kept the evening chill away.\n\nThe cocktails and food were outstanding, I enjoyed a take on a Dark and Stormy substituting Grapefruit for lime that's named June Gloom.\n\nWe ordered:\n* Winter Salad of a lightly dressed finely sliced Kale\n* Raw Oysters (half dozen)\n* Diver Scallops with small slices of pork belly\n* Whole Roasted Branzino\n\nFabulous meal all around.","3753":"The Lark was one of the most recommended places to eat in SB and deservedly so. \n\nIt has an amazing location and has a great outside seating that takes advantageous of the wonderful Santa Barbara weather.\n\nThe staff was excellent, attentive, knew their food and wine nuisances. We had a little issue at the table and they took care of it with care. \n\nFood was  top notched, wonderfully plated and full of interesting flavors combinations. Every was delicately balanced even with some the unique ingredients but my Asian palate prefers bolder flavors and nothing was eye opening amazing.\n\nThe complimentary popcorn was seasoned with Mexican Taijin like spices but was more subdued. I definitely liked the combination but wanted more zing. Started out with a half dozen oysters, cornbread and Brussels sprouts. Oysters were very good but not the best. Cornbread with jalape\u00f1os was the best I had but we had an issue with the plate the manager handled.\nThe Brussels sprouts were also a hit. We then had a dish of scallops and fish crude that were both excellent. We finished the meal with a wonderful dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThe Lark had great food, great wine and cocktails and would've been a perfect meal if not for an incident. The staff was very understanding and made me forget about it the rest of the night. I would definitely come back with hesitation.","3754":"Great place. Went on a Thursday at 7pm and luckily there was a cancellation for a two top next to a fireplace. Great ambiance, very good service, the food was fantastic. Now, we were told we were incredibly lucky getting the \"most requested table\" without a reservation and walking in...but that aside, one of may favorite restaurant experiences ever. \nAppetizers- Brussel sprouts. I don't know what they did to these things...ground up a unicorn on top of it or what, but damn they are SOOO good.\n\nPlates- we ordered the octopus, which we're snobs about. It was better than I've had overseas. Just ridiculous. Order it.\nThen we ordered the flat iron steak\/broccoli plate...The marinate it for I believe, longer than the cow was alive. Unreal. And they know how to cook it just enough. Order that too.\n\n-Insert \"Black Manhattan\" cocktail here...find religion.\n\n-Desert...we don't have sweet tooth's so we went with a cheese plate. Excellent options and great with our wine...of which they have a good list. \n\nAmbiance- we were spoiled rotten and lucky as hell. But we sat outside next to a fireplace under old school amber light bulbs. It was full, but not loud. The service was great and they understood to not overdo it but not let us go without at the same time. \n\nThere's hardly any parking, but a valet. I would Uber anywhere in SB anyway as it isn't the most parking friendly city ever...","3755":"Don't waste your time or money. Food is incredibly overpriced. Hostesses snobby. Our waiter was personable while he was with us, but forgot to get us a drink and ignored us for 30 min at a time multiple times. The dishes we tried (8 in total) were okay but had multiple issues (over-sauces, poorly composed etc) and seemed to be more about looks than taste. $38 for a tapas-sized plate? Ridiculous. I wish we'd gotten tacos at los agaves.","3756":"So if you ever are in the funkzone, you gotta check this place out. It gets super packed so please call in for reservations. Had a good time walking around the funkzone and wine tasting until dinner time. Its kinda crazy because we saw this confessional booth, but we had to confirm and the waitress said that they shipped it from like France or something and it was made like in 1920s or something. Theyre very in detailed with their architecture. Anyways, the food was good, but i thought it was a bit on the salty side. If you must come here though, try the yellowtail collar and the flat iron steak. Those were my favorite. I wasnt too in the oysters we got, bc i thought they were going to be just raw, but they added this watermelon sauce thing on top which i didnt really like, butttt it is very creative. Everything on the menu here was creative and flavored differently which was nice.Also go the bone marrow, but they barely had any marroowwww. Kinda disappointed in that, but besides that the flavors were good. Might have to order a good amount because the portions are a bit small.","3757":"Worth every penny as the food was inventive and ridiculously delicious. We had the deviled eggs (one of the best, creamiest, and most interesting tasting I've ever had), the brussels sprouts (is fish sauce a secret ingredient? Because, WOW, they are amazesprouts), the pork belly with pickled pepper and almond brittle (please eat that as one bite because it will be a party in your mouth), and the beef cheeks with grilled veg -- the carrots are great, but i skipped the rutabega in favor of eating more beef cheeks (so good that I chose a glass of madeira to accompany the remaining beef cheek for dessert because why bother with a pastry when there's this amazing savory thing in front of you and no fridge in your hotel room). \n\nBtw, we did look at the dessert menu and there were 1 or 2 interesting and innovative options that sounded worthwhile.\n\nWe also had great cocktails (Hummingbird and some unbelievably good tequila drink that I was jealous I hadn't ordered).\n\nAlthough we had a reservation, we came early for a cocktail and ended up staying at the communal table because we loved our waitress, Amy, so much!\n\nMy main critique of this restaurant is the food is heavy on the salt. Lighten that up and then you have perfection.\n\nAlso, this was a lot of food for the 2 of us (1 app, 1 veg, and 1 \"ranch\" and 1 \"platter) ... the latter is meant to be shared by 2 people as an entree. Worth it, but may want to drop an element if you're not on the super hungry side.","3758":"Fantastic. Service was great, wine superb, food tops. Dan the GM should get a raise. His staff is what this experience is all about.\nFive stars plus.","3759":"THE FOOD WAS MAGICAL.....started with the deviled egges...good...then moved to the Brussel sprouts....the dates in them made it... pork belly was just right...had the octopus ...the best.....best food around. .fun family style....I just left 3 hours ago...ready to come back!!!NOW!!!!- yes please.... I don't leave a lot of reviews...this was a must...","3760":"So my boyfriend and I love finding new restaurants to check out and driving to Santa Barbara from the Bay Area allowed us a chance to find somewhere awesome for dinner. The Lark had wonderful reviews and luckily we made a reservation, we may not have gotten in without it! \n\nWe were warmly greeted when we arrived and seated quickly. I was worried that we would receive lesser service because we are younger and weren't as well dressed as most of the other patrons but we were given a great table and our server could not have been more kind to us. \n\nOur server was fantastic, introducing us to the menu and answering all of our questions prominently. We both received our drinks quickly and my iced tea was fantastic!!! I know that this sounds silly but I drink a ton of iced tea and theirs was the best! Our server also refilled my glass 4 times without my even asking, something which I appreciate very much! \n\nI loved that they gave specialty popcorn instead of bread. The popcorn was fantastic and we were given a generous refill when we asked! \n\nWe had the kale salad which was wonderful, a  great serving for 2 and a wonderful mix of flavors. \n\nI was less crazy about the pate but I think that it was only because of my personal taste.  The presentation was beautiful and another generous serving. \n\nThe time spacing between the dishes was wonderful, the meal flowed nicely and we were given the appropriate amount of attention from the servers.  \n\nWe shared the fish and it was amazing! The presentation was gorgeous and I don't think that I have ever been served a whole fish in a restaurant! I didn't love the risotto on it's own but paired the the fish was WONDERFUL!!! \n\nThe serving was great for 2 and we were both very satisfied at the end! We couldn't help but order the house made ice cream sandwiches and they were, again, FANTASTIC!!! They were presented wonderfully, the cookies were fresh and crunchy with sweet vanilla ice cream and caramel.  I didn't want it to end!\n\nThe Lark also offered a traditional absinthe cocktail which isn't easy to find and my boyfriend happily enjoyed his.  The price was steep ($18) but for something so rare and hard to make, it was worth the price.  \n\nI also loved the option to buy the kitchen staff a 6 pack of beer, My boyfriend and I have both worked in the restaurant industry and loved this! We were happy to contribute to the staff being able to relax after providing a wonderful service.  I absolutely loved the Lark and happily left a 30% tip because of how wonderful the service was. If you are in the Santa Barbara area, I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the Lark and I can't wait to go back again for another delicious meal! \n\nLast note, the noise level was amazing! I don't know how they did it, but it was a packed house and I didn't even notice the other noise around us. We were able to have an intimate dinner without being bothered by typical restaurant noise.","3761":"We went there last night\nAlways looking for a new restaurant in SB\nThe food was excellent, the service was even better!\n\"The funk zone\" needed a great restaurant and its here!\nWill be there again soon","3762":"Not impressed.  Was this just a bad night? Both service and food were not on par with the reputation of all the reviews. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation. When we checked in, the hostess said that they were on-schedule, but we were seated 15 minutes after our reservation.\n\nThe waitress greeted us with a bottle of water and just sat it down on the table--really? She didn't even pour us any water. The drinks we ordered were Arnold Palmer, iced tea, lemonade, and a whiskey neat (no ice). They arrived separately, one lemonade and one iced tea, and five minutes later one lemonade and a whiskey with ice. I'm still confused how half the drinks were incorrect.\n\nThe cheese and charcuterie boards were the stars of the night. There was a lot of variety in flavors and textures. The cheese board included a goat cheese, a white cheddar, and a bleu cheese, some apples, fruits, and crusty bread. I wish the bread was just a little softer. The charcuterie included prosciutto, salami, and another meat, pickled veggies, and more crusty bread.\n\nThe rest of the food was disappointing, all for various reasons.\n\n- the Brussels sprouts were too salty\n- the hanger steak was inconsistent. Our friend stopped by The Lark earlier in the week and recommended this dish. When it arrived, it barely fed 4 people. The 4 slices of beef were super thin. We turned around to the two tables next to us who also ordered this dish and they had thicker pieces of meat. How can The Lark justify charging $19 for a plate of broccoli and red peppers?\n- the red snapper dish was just a mess. The snapper was over cooked, leaving the meat tough. The coconut broth was super salty (surprising considering it was in a coconut broth), fried parsnips were also overly salted and the stewed parsnips were under cooked. The only plus was that there were at least 5 mussels and 10 clams that accompanied the dish.\n- the profiterole description said that the outside was a graham cracker crunch, but the profiterole was just soggy.\n\nService throughout the dinner was also poor. The server would take our glasses to refill the tea and lemonade, but when she stopped by again, we had to keep asking where the drinks were. After the steak dish, she came to see if we wanted anything else for dinner, but the snapper hadn't even arrived. Still in shock that this experience was so disappointing.","3763":"You better have a reservation here, but even waiting is worth it in any case. The food is amazing and presented extremly well.","3764":"I'm late to the game, but am becoming A regular. Really enjoyed the beer and wine selection as well as the food. Creative and flavorful entr\u00e9es. Delicious salads. Great atmosphere and a lot of beautiful people to boot.","3765":"Wonderful dinner with a friend, this was my second time visiting The Lark and I am so happy I did. \n\nThe food was great - had some melon sushi thing that was very refreshing. The steak is cooked perfectly and served with tons of fresh vegetables and the sprouts are a savory stater. \n\nI would recommend this spot to anyone visiting or living in Santa Barbara. The attention to detail from design to service is fantastic. My only complaint is the host was wearing a very short and low cut romper. A little to casual and sexy for a host, her butt cheeks were almost hanging out and her bra strap showed visibly across the center of her back. Great for a night out but not for a host at a dinner where I'm dropping $$$$","3766":"Disappointing. Over-seasoned, poorly executed and sloppily arranged food masquerading as haut cuisine. The deviled eggs were pulled directly from a too-cold fridge and were no better than ones you could make at home. The much heralded brussel sprouts were OK, but did not need to be so sweet. The wedge salad was a mess, and the porchetta was so over salted it was  inedible. Come on Santa Barbara, you can do better than this.","3767":"No need to say I will NOT go back ! Entered the restaurant and instead of \" Hello , Welcome \" the Lady upfront says: \" do you have a reservation ? \" we did not have and happened to be there with my kids and i try every place once. In any case she finds \"ONE \" table ( there were at least 10 other empty ones ) it is at the entrance of the place with three small tables and four mini chairs ( i thought they were decorations ) NO i don't want to be torture or ridiculed when I go out for dinner ! so they found another table out side and she says \" You have to be finished in an hour ! , because we have another reservation\" who says that ???? never before i heard that. so we sit down and try to order from their rather strange and small menu, which my kids did not like at all. ( the waitress was very nice and brought us the pop corn after my kids asked for it ) so  now We order and there comes the food and three servers standing , while another person repeats exact words on the menu that i ordered from ; VERY STRANGE ! and pretentious ! the food was not that good at all !  NO I will not go there again.","3768":"The food is great, the ambience is fun, and the staff is incredible! We had such a great all-around experience and will definitely be coming back. The only disappointment is that you HAVE to get a reservation, but that's just a testament to how great they're doing.","3769":"My wife and I ate here on July 4, 2018. Reservations were for dinner @ 7:30p and we were promptly seated. However, service from thereon on was spotty to downright bad. Request for pepper finally arrived half way through meal. Empty drink dirty glasses not removed. We each ordered glasses of wine which finally arrived when we were almost finished. We had to repeatedly request for the espresso coffee ordered. We were informed that the bar was \"backed up\". The chicken liver mousse dish was a total mess. Not sure what the chef was attempting. Overall, at these prices we were quite disappointed and cannot recommend. Understand that it was a holiday and they were busy; however, they seemed overwhelmed and under performed.","3770":"The crab gnocchi was amazing.. The red fish was also really good but on the too spicy side. Def order the Brussels sprouts! Goat Cheese cake was Also awesome. Not sure what was up with the popcorn tho !!","3771":"I really want to give this place 5 stars, I do. The food was excellent, and our server was awesome. But the greeting from the host's alone was just so disappointing. We had made a reservation for 4, but when I received a call to confirm that same day, I added an extra person. When we arrived, the hostess apparently thought I was lying when I confirmed that I received that call. \"I doubt you changed it, we usually call the day before\" ( I had to physically show her on my phone). We had seen 4 open tables, and I asked if we could be seated a few minutes early, she told me I need to wait for my actual reservation time. Her tude was rude. I'm sorry, but if you're the first face you see when you enter a restaurant like Lark, at least have a smile on your face, that's it. Ok..moving on!\n\nThe food was absolutely fantastic. Ordered the oysters, brusell sprouts (YUM), beef cheek, pork belly, and scallops. GREAT sharing portions, and you definitely get what you pay for, unlike some of the smaller plates that are priced ridiculously at most restaurants. Everything was a win!!! Atmosphere and decor (not to mention the cool old French church confessional booth) was amazing. Will come back for the food alone!! Thanks Lark for your delicious food, but maybe you should have a chat with your hostess and host :)","3772":"Loved everything about this place (except the hostess who as she seated us told us three times we needed to be done by 8:00 for next reservation - tacky!) other than that, this place rocks. Food was amazing and creative. Loved the family style and one entree at a time (although don't put a time limit on us and then only serve one dish at a time) still earns 5 stars tho as it's packed with atmosphere and great food and service!","3773":"Our meal was delicious and the dining experience was wonderful. Can't wait to come back! We had the deviled eggs, beat salad, and roasted chicken. I love the family meal style of dining.","3774":"The Lark is a trendy and nice restaurant for the funk zone. While a bit overpriced, their food is very unique as it is seasonal and very tasty. Portions are not huge since it is meant to be a family style restaurant where you share plates with others. We got the cheeseboard which was a little on the sweet side, the spiced cauliflower and the pimiento cheese toast. Our favorite was definitely the toast as it had the most flavor and also the most food. Regarding the service, our server was not terribly attentive and did not make us feel very welcome, which put a slight damper on our experience. Definitely a good place to see once in Santa Barbara, but it would be difficult to be a returning customer.","3775":"This place is great, right in the heart of the funkzone, always busy and bustling. Great energy and i really enjoy the farm to table feel.\n\nPlace seems a little overhyped and its definitely way overpriced. Also service was pretty bad, our waiter only came by twice the whole meal which is fine, except that any request you make to someone else that delivers the dish NEVER makes it through. I had asked 3 different servers for a drink. By the time we were done eating 45 minutes later and our waiter came, there was no drink order in so we cancelled and asked for the check.\n\nThe food is hit and miss, i recommend the pimento cheese and probably some of the best brussel sprouts in town if you like teriyaki flavors. \n\nThe short ribs were alright, not great, could be a personal taste issue but also the meet was charred on one side, and way under on the other. I do not mind rare meat but the forks to cut the meat are a joke. My table did not finish the dish.\n\nProps to the dessert though. Goat cheese profiteroles and the funnel cake were amazing!\n\nWould give more stars if service was better and the food\/service matched the price, which it does not. Hate to be a nag but there are lots of other places with similiar ambiance with a farm to table feel that has better food with fairer prices.","3776":"The food is good, but the service at busy hour is incredibly terrible. I went there today with a big group of people. I took a spot to sit, and asked the waitress to remove the plate and bill of the previous customer at my spot. Surprisingly, the waitress only took the bill away, and left the dirty plate, fork, and knife there. It seems that she only cared about the bill.\nWhen I was ordering, I asked if it was possible to have a separate bill for myself since I'll order a lot. The waitress refused to do so - in a rather rude way, I would say - and she told me that my bill had to go with either of the two groups. After having the food, I found that other people in the big group had separate bills (not splitting for each person, since some of them are couples), but my bill was with another couple. Although I don't really care, but I feel being disrespected by being forced to not have my own bill in a rude way, while others had their own.\nIn the end, I have to say that the food is awesome. But the service here makes this place deserve a one-star comment.","3777":"God bless those delived eggs, the brussel sprouts, the risotto, and Cory, who was the greatest server ever.","3778":"The good:  free valet parking, nice ambiance and music, very friendly staff, large portions \n\nThe bad:  silly popcorn basket instead of bread (bread was later offered but never delivered), food was kind of stuff you can make at home - way undercooked broccoli, roasted brussell sprouts, grilled zucchini.  Not bad, but not worth dining out for .  unfortunately this type of \"farm to table\" cuisine is becoming all too common. \n\nShould have gone to Olio pizza instead, but glad I tried it.","3779":"Can't rave about this place enough. We came here on a last minute decision, over Bouchon's. Let me tell you something... WOW!\n\nWe came here because it was very close to our hotel and the reviews were stellar. we were celebrating our anniversary. We showed up with a bottle of nice champagne and proceeded to the front desk. The hostess told us that there was no tables available and they were booked for the evening. We were bummed but a manager came by and asked us if there was any issues. He had us sit outside for a few moments and wait.\n\nAfter waiting for about three minutes, we were seated at the communal tables. We enjoyed some of their finest foods. The cheese boards and meet boards are out of this world.\n\nWe enjoyed our anniversary dinner and had the time of our lives.next time we are in Santa Barbara, we are definitely going to return.this is a hotspot you don't want to miss. Make your reservations ahead of time. They book very fast. \n\nI can't wait to visit them next time SB is on our road trip venue!","3780":"Every time I have been to the Lark it has been delicious and fun. Lots of people but we always get a seat. I love the brussel sprouts and the tasty dishes to share. The bartenders can be a bit pretentious but thats ok. I was blown away by the hamburger, the best one in town, unless of course you consider the great burger at the Jalama Beach grill, which is the best burger. Love the Lark.","3781":"Spent a Sunday evening at The Lark. - I highly recommend reservations, even on a Sunday night.We were greeted and seated promptly. The wait staff was very attentive and informative. We had Migs serve us. He had solid suggestions for eats and how many dishes to order. We over ordered anyway since we wanted to taste another entree. Next time we will stick to the suggested amount. \n\nOur EATS!!! \n\nBrussels Sprouts - full of flavor, I would say the portion is big enough for 4 people to split if you are having another \"starter\". For two people it was a little big (but not complaining). \n\nCentral Coast Vegetable - this came as a salad with a poached egg on top. Citrus mixed with greens, and the creamy egg!! It was delicious! It would be a \"reorder\" for us. \n\nSpanish Octopus - OMG, this was a great order. The Octopus was cooked perfectly. Not to rubbery, full of flavor, great texture. The size was perfect for two people to split \n\nSmoked Pork Belly - This dish came out after all the above. It was ok. We should not have ordered it. We were stuffed after the other dishes. It was good, but honestly it seemed like the same pork belly dish you get all over town. Its good, but I rather have the Octopus or try something new. \n\nCocktails - El Topo (I recommend asking for it to come with broken ice and not the one large cube) Nice and refreshing, would order again. \n\nAmbiance - tad loud if you're going for a nice quite romantic dinner. The atmosphere is great. Its lively, full of good music, and energy. The layout is open and airy, which is perfect on a summer night. Tables inside are set close together. I don't mind that style, plus you get to check out others dishes! \n\nI felt the portion for price was of value. Nothing seemed over the top expenses and the portions were decent.  I would come back in a heart beat and maybe save room for one of the amazing desserts!","3782":"Where do I begin? This place is my absolute favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. Pricey? Somewhat, but welcome to Santa Barbara. Their brussels sprouts are a must, as well as their deviled eggs. I've gone here with friends, family and with the man slice. The Lark never seizes to impress me with their menu. Their portions are rather large, so be sure to go with a group to split appetizers, entree's etc, or go with an appetite. Try their Chicken&Grits ( if its still on their menu) and get a local bottle of SB County wine. You won't be disappointed!","3783":"Another great meal at The Lark... dinner for four, oysters, octopus, scallops, cod and ribeye steak.  Wow, everything was amazing.  Our waiter was very helpful, cocktails were inventive and good selection of wines by the glass.  This place is in the heart of the \"Funk Zone\" and always packed.  Reservations are a must.  Would highly recommend.","3784":"One of my top 5 restaurants of all time. I'll drive 2 hours from LA to visit the Lark for a meal. I love the popcorn appetizer, the pork belly is my favorite and the blondie ice cream sandwich is to die for.","3785":"A restaurant that encourages experimentation in your food choices and then rewards that bravery.  We had a vegetarian with us so we chose vegetables and fish choices all of which were excellent.  The cauliflower and couscous with Mideastern spices may have been the best vegetarian dish I have ever eaten.  The Agnolotti pasta was both unusual and extraordinary.  The scallops were more traditional but still excellent.  The only dish to disappoint was the steelhead trout.  Lemon fritters were the perfect finish.\n\nOur server could expound on every spice in every dish.  She was attentive and managed our eight or so shared dishes well.  When a glitch occurred with one of the dishes, she took responsibility and quickly corrected the problem.\n\nI also have to commend the owner on repurposing so many fixtures and woods to create a modern restaurant out of pieces with a history.\n\nDon't miss the Lark if you are in Santa Barbara, but plan ahead several months.","3786":"Really great food. They are very pushy about \"needing\" to order more food. The platters are bigger than you'd expect them to be","3787":"Terrific casual place. Good for a couple or a crowd. Creative menu and everything I've had in 3 meals here has been exceptional. I'll be back again before the end of summer.","3788":"Came here for anniversary dinner. Food was mediocre and expensive. Server was nice. They seated us next to a fire damn near died of the heat. I live in LA, I know good expensive food when I've had it. We ordered the pork belly and wagyu. You can't call your shit wagyu, most toughest meat I've ever had. Also as a huge meat lover, everyone knows wagyu is from Japan. Australian wagyu why even call it wagyu. I would have rather gone to mastros. Pork belly was overly sweet. Their pairings with the food were strange, like they were trying too hard to be hip. Prob one of the most wack places I've eaten at. Maybe I didn't order the right thing who knows, but would not pay 80$ for the whatever food we got.","3789":"My husband and I went to The Lark last weekend to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. It was a fabulous experience and we will definitely visit again when we are back in the area. \n\nMy overall impression:\n\nAmbience was incredible. Love the decor. \n\nFood was delish. Nothing that absolutely BLEW me away but the mister and I are pretty picky and have high standards. I enjoyed every single thing I ate and especially recommend the brussels sprouts and the pork chop. \n\nThe service was friendly and warm. I'd noted on Open Table that it was our anniversary and they seated us with an adorable handwritten note on the table to thank us for celebrating with them. \n\nThat being said, our particular server was...meh. He was nice enough but he actually told us \"I don't recommend ordering that many dishes.\" We both are serious weight lifters and fitness professionals--and have big appetites. So it was a little insulting to be told how much food we should be eating! Other than that the service was great. \n\nYou 100% need a rez, so make sure you do so in advance. I reserved 3 days ahead and was still only able to get 9:15. We were seated right away and served promptly. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this joint and will be back!","3790":"This place is delicious!\nThe pimento cheese was yummy and the wedge salad was the best ever!\nThe grilled octopus with couscous was our favorite entree :)","3791":"From the minute I made my reservation over the phone, to the time we sadly had to say goodbye after finishing dessert, my husband and I loved The Lark. Everything we had was delicious, the presentation was excellent, and the ambience was perfect. And the service was STELLAR. We loved the touch of asking us over the phone if we were celebrating anything (because we were), and it made it that much more special to be greeted with congratulations and well wishes. I would definitely go to The Lark if you are in The Funk Zone or SB!","3792":"Such a beautiful well done restaurant. Ambiance was perfect and in a really trendy cool location. Food was extremely creative and tasty. Probably the best restaurant in downtown Santa Barbara.","3793":"Where do I begin describing this delightful restaurant? I'd honestly like to have a beer with the chef -- that guy is a genius. I can't say enough good things about the food here -- it's very sophisticated, exceptionally flavorful and beautifully presented. The ham and cheese sandwich with prosciutto and jalape\u00f1os was one of the tastiest things I've had in my mouth in a long time. The wine selection was excellent, as was the service -- bonus points for the server's friendly description of the courses. I really loved this place and I would highly recommend it to anyone in the SB area!!","3794":"Great service.  Nice outdoor patio.  Food is good, but not amazing. Portions on the smaller side and fun to share a few. The gnocchi with crab was delish.","3795":"For a new restaurant, this place totally hits the mark.  For a well established restaurant, this place still hits the mark.  The decor is vintage funk cool hip, unlike anything in Santa Barbara.  \nThe place is full of locals, and I mean full. It is getting rave reviews in all the local newspapers and deservedly so.  \nThe owners have created  tasteful, superb, friendly restaurant that has me in awe of a first time restarauntier.  \nI am impressed, and have been there 2 times with excellent experiences, and will be continuing to go and make this my new go-to place and recommendation.\n\nStill excellent. And the service is impeccable. They explain EVERY dish they bring to the table with a smile.","3796":"This is as close as you're going to get to go to Ottolanghi outside of London.  The food is absolutely brilliant and service is spot on.  The wait staff is as enthusiastic about the food as the kitchen.  \n\nWedge salad is scrumptious, broccoli is perfection.  The duck breast is the most tender I've had in the US and the duck mouse is paired with the most delicate citrus and ginger, it's a dream.   Plating is organic and elegant. There is so much intension put into the dining experience at Lark, I can't wait to return.","3797":"This place knocked our socks off. We called for reservations the night before, and they managed to squeeze us in. They asked if it was a special event and we said yes, our anniversary, so they gave us a nice little table outside beside the firepit, and gave us some bubbly when we arrived. We ordered yummy cocktails, Brussels sprouts, duck confit, and grilled octopus. We had creme brulee for dessert. The service was excellent, very professional and friendly at the same time. I really recommend especially the duck and Brussels sprouts, and they go together very well. The octopus was delicious too. The atmosphere was perfect, and the decor lovely. I really couldn't ask for more, especially for a special occasion.","3798":"Have been to The Lark twice in the last several months.  The first time I would have given it 4 stars. Second time 2.75 to be exact :) I can't recall what we had the first visit but I do remember almost everything being pretty tasty. Maybe one item of 5 I would not order again. Second visit the only 2 of the 6 items I can recommend.. The really moist and just barely sweet cornbread with honey chile butter. More butter than needed so it was pretty hard not to just spoon it up at the end.  Also I can recommend the pineapple upside down dessert. Tart berry sauce, dense cake and pineapples and what seemed like a minty cream,  all so good and balanced portion. Now for the bad news... Crab risotto.  I really went out on a limb order this because I love crab just all alone and risotto is often so heavy but, I thought, it's almost ways delicious how could it go wrong. Well,  rename it \"saltless long grain rice porridge with  mushrooms of little flavor' and you now have an accurate description. There was no visible crab and no crab flavor. Only mushrooms. No flavor of the Sea at all.  Odd. We only ate about 1\/3 of the dish. I have noticed that the crab, in general, in California doesn't have as much flavor as the gulf coast or the Northwest. Then we had duck confit, it was ok,  a little dry.  Have had much better. Bibb salad... Enormous, could feed 5,there were only two of us,  just prep accordingly, too much guilt leaving so much on the plate.  Leaving on a positive note,  the atmosphere is just wonderful, especially the patio,servers were friendly and attentive.  Will go again but just for drink, app and atmosphere.","3799":"What a wonderful dining experience! Our server Jazz was AMAZING and gave us the rundown of the menu and even put together a list of restaurants and wineries for my wife and me as we are visiting Santa Barbra this weekend for a friend's wedding. Food wise all you need to know is the wedge salad, foie gras tourchon, and the pappardelle.  The foie was pretty much life changing...who would have thought to pair cashew butter and a burnt caramel sauce with foie gras? It was truly a decadent experience. Pair it with their take on a Sazerac with a local apple brandy if Your me in the mood for a cocktail (and who isn't?). If we lived up here this would definitely be a favorite spot and it's for sure one we will be returning to when we visit again.","3800":"I REALLY wanted to like The Lark, but once again there was nothing special, except that there was a little MOUSE that ran across the back patio area of the restaurant!\n\nHere are my complaints:\n-smoked pork belly was way too sweet with the blackberry glaze\n-the full-sized charcuterie platter only had two different cuts of meat (coppa and salami)\n-$24 for a dish with only chickpeas and carrots??\n\nPositive:\n-portion sizes are generous\n-house-pickled veggies are delicious\n-grilled octopus cooked to perfection","3801":"I was in town for a conference and someone recommended that I make a stop here. I'm quite glad I did. \nFlying solo, I decided to post up at the bar. Ordered myself a spicy margarita and it did not disappoint. Unfortunately, the bartender was in the weeds due to some people calling out of work. He did the best he could in a less than ideal situation. Especially considering the fact that the cocktails are craft, so they are great, but take longer than your average g&t. He also described each dish that I had questions about impeccably and didn't leave out a single detail. \nPortions here are sharing size. Not Italian family dinner style sharing size, but more like your average non over-eater foodie sharing size. I only ate 40%-50% of each of the dishes I ordered. \nI got the Porchetta & Burrata, and, at the suggestion of the bartender, the Grilled Japanese Eggplant. \nThe Porchetta was rich and slightly spicy, but very good and interesting. \nThe Eggplant was the highlight for me. A perfect creation from the Chef that I would recommend to anyone despite what they like or don't. \nGreat interior vibe in the joint. It's a good place to try if you enjoy really good food creations. Check it out.","3802":"Unbelievable. Came in. Asked to sit down in another party table. Or outside but you have no service from us, even though we were IN the restaurant.... half empty place that does not welcome Tourism.... guess they dont need or crave business. No problem, plenty of places around","3803":"Hip, tasteful venue and menu. Has a big city feel with very friendly small town service. Fun place for singles, groups or romantic couples.","3804":"We went to The Lark for dinner and it was one of the best foodie experiences we've ever had! Check out our full review: http:\/\/chroniclefoodie.com\/home\/2014\/1\/12\/foodie-diaries-the-lark","3805":"Great start to finish! Excellent customer service. Care put into a gourmet meal. Clean, clean, clean. Thank you so much!","3806":"My wife and I have repeatedly gone to LARK and the food and folks are the BEST...and if that isn't enough, the team at LARK also, every time, go to great effort to make sure we are comfortable and taken care of as if we mattered, now that's rare enough. And certainly reason enough to enjoy LARK, over and over.","3807":"The Lark, Santa Barbara \n\nI just want to say a big thank you to everyone at The Lark. I had helped plan a friends 40th birthday dinner and the entire evening was flawless. From the point of the initial reservation to our bill and all the deliciousness in between it was a wonderful night. Our seating of 10 girls was running a bit late but none of us minded in the slightest because the host and the manager made sure we were taken care of with a glass of sparkling wine. When were seated there was a beautiful cheese platter waiting for us as an apology. Our server was so attentive and lovely just punctuating the incredible meal we are all still talking about. We had a magnum of Sparkling wine to celebrate our friends birthday and never did we have to pour it ourselves. The manager (i wish I could remember his name) was on top of it. I had been wanting to try your restaurant for a while now and was beyond impressed. Thank you for making that night so special ... Although, my guess is that is your standard. I look forward to my next trip to Santa Barbara with my first stop being The Lark.\nOh, and those brusel sprouts.... Painfully delicious!","3808":"Amazing experience!  Service is impeccable, the food delectable!  Best restaurant in Santa Barbara","3809":"You start off with their house seasoned popcorn which was good the waiter was very nice knew everything and anything to suggest...Wow the half chicken dish with grits insane I've never liked grits and these were incredible you could eat them all day ,did the deviled eggs as an app very good ..just the right amount of food","3810":"Definite 4 for SB but in LA it'd be a 3.\n\nAmbience is busy but nice. The fire pit  outside adds a lot. Service was okay. Portions are pretty huge so don't over order. The food is on the heavy side. \n\nBe sure to visit Les Marchands next door for wine.","3811":"i had high hopes based on the enthusiastic recommendations from friends, perhaps we were there on an off night. it started off on a sour note with a lackluster welcome from our server . then, we were told we needed to order everything at once so the chef could time the courses (s\/he failed to do so -- we started with \"snacks\" almost immediately, then our sliders arrived before the salad, which came about 20 or 30 minutes after we finished the sliders. we waited again for the platter). they charged us for a beer that the server delivered 15 minutes after the rest of the cocktails -- we couldn't flag her down but apparently the keg needed switched. that's fine but any restaurant that wants to play up the pretense knows you shouldn't charge for the drink. we asked for a steak knife to help serve the short ribs and the runner told us \"no -- just use the spoon.\" Fine, I understand that they're braised for 8 to 10 hours but a spoon? They're not that tender. In short, a let down -- it aims for the big leagues but has some way to go ...","3812":"Awesome place . Very nice staff . The food are very good . We made a reservation for VDay and the staff explain each and every dish that we ordered. I will definitely come here again.","3813":"My wife and I ate dinner here.  The outside patio area was great and our server was most attentive.  The food was average - I had the short rib and it didn't seem like any short rib I had ever had.  The evening was spoiled for us by a very rude customer who wanted our table (we were seated at a table for four) for him, his wife and another couple.  After the \"incident\"  the manager came to us and apologized but the staff seating guests should not have let this bozo roam the restaurant trying to find his own table.","3814":"The beef cheeks were excellent.  We had a large group, and everything we ordered, including the drinks, was delicious.  We made the reservations ahead of time and we were supposed to sit outside but since it was raining they opened up their back dining room, which was nice of them so we didn't have to sit outside in the cold.  Yelp said not good for kids, probably because they don't have a kids menu, but they had a few off menu options for my child, and also high chairs for the babies that were with us - they were still nice to us even though we had kids :-)","3815":"This is always a great food experience. Must haves: Brussel  Sprouts, Hamachi and the Mary's chicken with black pepper grits. Everything is amazing!  Still one of the most happening spots in SB and right in the middle of the funk zone.","3816":"terrible meal.  the salad had massive clunks of goat cheese and a heavy load of greasy dressing.  the appetizer was served on a soggy wooden cheeseboard that looked like it had being laying on the ground somewhere.  The fish was overcooked and rubbery.","3817":"Crispy Brussels Sprouts. Roasted Delicata Squash. Southern Pimento Cheese Toast. Roasted Beef Carpaccio. 12 Hour Lamb Shoulder Confit. Order any of these things and you will be happy. Their appetizers are my personal favorite and the lamb shoulder is wonderful. Great spot for date night and the atmosphere is really nice.","3818":"Corn bread with chili butter soooo good. Brussels sprouts always a hit! Scallops and hamachi crudo just ok....scallops a little over sauced.","3819":"Super fun, super loud on a busy night.  everything is well done and the setting can't be beat in Santa Barbara.  A place for the young at heart.  These people love what they do, have great energy and want you to enjoy yourself.  \n\nTake a moment to watch everyone working in the kitchen.  Just a great vibe to see everyone working\/playing and kicking out some really interesting combinations.","3820":"Trendy, hip place, serving contemporary American\/southern style food with a modern twist. Would recommend the brussel sprouts and ribs, both were delicious. The scallops dish was fine, just not my favorite scallops dish I've tasted. The popcorn starter they give you is very yummy. Lively ambiance. Would recommend trying this place if you're looking for a trendy place with good food.","3821":"Another 5 star review for \"The Lark\" and after you eat there you'll understand.  Great tasting food, atmosphere, service, and presentation -- what more could you ask for?  We sat outside on the large patio (dog friendly) and enjoyed some stellar dishes such as:\n1. Warm Sourdough Pretzel - great way to start the meal (big enough for two people -- plus that \"hop\" butter is interesting\n2. Niman Ranch Pork Chop - Tender as butter with glazed nectarines and plenty of veggies\n3. Sunburst squash and farrow with charred apricots -- even non-veggies would be happy with this. \n\nWe were too full for desert but next time for sure.","3822":"I love how casual this restaurant is, while at the same time serving interesting dishes of the highest quality. The flank steak here was amazing, it melted in my mouth. The octopus dish was equally tender and delicately grilled. The scallop crudo had a bit much going on, but we'll forgive them for that. We arrived for an early dinner at 5:15, and it was very quiet for a while before the evening crowd started filling up. Cocktail and wine selection was solid too. Prices are reasonable for quality. Overall, I loved this place and would gladly come back.","3823":"We had great service and fabulous food. It is hard to beat the Lark. If you are a Brussels sprouts eater, these are among the best I have had (and I have them regularly in locations across the country).","3824":"Went with a group for dinner on Saturday night, had a good time and the food was great too.  My wife is vegan, and once we told our server that he made sure to let the kitchen know and they totally modified our dishes so she could eat them and they were delicious.  A little loud but cool vibe and would go back.","3825":"I found this place very charming in this new fun district in Santa Barbara called \"The Funk Zone\".\nIt\"s a great atmosphere with nice seating indoors and outdoors.Very tasty modern California food.My favorite was the duck. Tender and seasoned to perfection.Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable .Very good selection of wines and special cocktails. Food is farm to table so expect freshness.I had a very pleasant dining experience and I would highly recommend this place.Especially if you are looking for a romantic date.","3826":"Lovely ambience! Hot and new makes this a place that's always poppin! Bartenders are quite talented. Not a big fan of le menu though... Brussels and steak are good. Everything else seems a bit scattered..","3827":"We had a 9:00 reservation on a Sunday night and were impressed to find the restaurant full. We were seated outdoors, but even on a chilly night we kept warm with their heat lamps and fires. For an appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs and pimento cheese fritters. Both were exceptional. They have the service down to a science where you never wait more than a few minutes between dishes. They prepare everything family style, which is great for sharing. For the entrees we got the crispy smoked pork belly and the bone marrow crusted beef cheeks. The pork belly was outstanding and even the fat on it was smooth and perfectly finished. The beef cheeks was the most amazing meat we've ever eaten. You could slice through it with a fork. Even the root vegetables with it were soft. I'll be dreaming about this meal for weeks to come.","3828":"I've been here twice now. My first time I came here (it's been over three years) I had a fantastic time with my wife. Everything was great. The second time I had the complete opposite experience. I don't know what happened. The food just seems so much extra, I couldn't wrap my palate around it. The food was just every where. The description in the menus did not reflect what you got on the plate. What we thought we ordered, we didn't get. I hope more people had my first time then my second time","3829":"This is seriously as good as it gets in Santa Barbara! The rigorous training they put their servers through really shows in the service. As someone who has traveled quite a bit and enjoys luxury service and hospitality, I would highly recommend this restaurant just based on service. However, the locally sourced food is absolutely wonderful as well!","3830":"Came here with family, visiting from the east coast, recommended by hotel concierge.  What a mistake. I will first admit, maybe we did this place wrong.  If we had ordered beers and burgers and sat at the bar, perhaps it would have been totally different.  But we didn't, we came for a nice dinner, visiting Santa Barbara for just a day, and had such a laughable experience we....well... spent most of the night laughing at just how bad it was.  It's been a few weeks and any time I recommend anything to my family, my dad makes some comment like \"ok Lark\"...and my opinion is quickly dismissed hahah.  \n\nStrike 1 - We were sat outside right next to the entrance, which was probably the worst table in the place, but my fault, I didn't make a reservation.\n\nStrike 2 - The waitress very awkwardly guided us to our table and then started talking about the menu, but she did so in a manner in which she was basically just reading word for word what it said.  Suddenly she stopped and said 'I'll give you a few minutes'.  I asked for an appetizer recommendation, she said the brussels sprouts were amazing.  Done.\n\nThe waitress then came back, but midway through talking to us she was interrupted by another waitress who explained that the first waitress was new, and proceeded to just overtake our table.  Then the craziest, most bizarre thing happened.  She had the other girl stand there to observe her wait our table...sort of a \"watch how it is done\" thing....and this 'veteran' waitress just started reading off the menu and stating the most obvious of things \"these are the snacks, they usually precede the meal, they're relatively small in size, you can have more than one....these are from the ranch, and are animal based dishes...these are from the ocean..etc etc.\"...and continued to list all the dishes.\n\nI honestly felt like I was in some weird movie like 'The Shining' where you start to question your own sanity.  Like we understand what appetizers are, and meat and fish dishes, and are perfectly literate (literally holding in bursts of laughter at this point).\n\nStrike 3 -  We order the Ribs and Sea Bass.\n\nI'm writing way too much...but the ribs were atrocious, barely any meat, a seasoning that I don't know how to describe, but was anything but good.  The sea bass came in a bowl with some sort of green slop underneath it, which my sister quickly labeled 'swamp soup.'  It was just very bad.  Oh, and I almost forgot, the amazing brussel sprouts were fine, but nothing to write home about.\n\n**Absolutely puzzled by the reviews and our experience.  We must have ordered the worst dishes, on the worst day, at the worst table with the worst waitress, and foolishly skipped out on drinks.  I'm giving 2 stars because the restaurant had a nice ambiance and I could see the meal going differently for someone else.\n\nSteer clear of the sea bass and ribs.","3831":"Make reservations! That way, you won't have to worry about getting a spot --this place  is crowded for a reason!\n\nFree popcorn while waiting --soo good. SERVICE? Awesome. Food? Amazing!\n\nWe spent a lot for fine dining and we got what we came for. Shareable plates make the experience even greater. The bone marrow, short ribs, chicken, and brussel sprouts were top knotch!","3832":"THE DESSERTS! WOW they were so delicious, words can't describe how much I liked their desserts. \nWe ordered three different types\n\n1. Lemon tart - it captured the tartness of the lemon and the ice cream on top totally balanced out the flavor- it also looked super sophisticated\n\n2. Blueberries ice cream puff- oh wow the combination was very well done. So good\n\n3. Ice cream sandwich - the best of all three desserts, simple concept but the lark \ndefinitely brought it up to a different level. The cookies were so well done and the ice cream OMG so good. MUST ORDER!\n\nEven the free popcorns at the bar had a kick to it. I definitely going to come back to try their full menu!","3833":"Omg. What a great place. We visited our friends in SB and they took us here. It's a nice little trendy spot. Trendy is not at all important to me. I don't care what a restaurant looks like as Long as the food is good. This place had a great vibe AND the good was great. \nBrussels sprouts \nPimento cheese \nCharcuterie board \nBeet and burrata salad \nPork \nPavlova \n\nAll. So. Good. \n\nOh! And a really nice and attentive staff. \n\nAnd great drinks!!! I had a Moscow mule. It was a little different then how they are usually made but still great. \n\nI can't wait to go back when we visit SB again.","3834":"Good service and atmosphere. Menu was pretentious, which is fine, but the food did not live up to it. Everything was incredibly greasy and all dishes (we had the chicken, Brussels sprouts and hummus) were soaked with vinegar and oil. Very heavy hand with the vinegar. In the end, I put my phone on the table and had to wipe off the grease on my case, which was hard since there was so much grease on my hands already. On top of that, the taste of everything was meh at best.","3835":"This is a popular spot but not a favorite. It's energetic here but the food does not seem high quality. It's kind of the illusion of good. But the wait staff is nice and the atmosphere is pleasant. The wine bar behind this restaurant is the best thing about the whole place.","3836":"Visiting from the South Bay, Tried this place out last night. Wait was 1.5 hours so my husband and I put our names down and they texted us when our table was almost ready. We were able to go to bar near by and wait which was nice. \n\nWe got seated and our waitress that came over appeared tired and \"over it\". Maybe it was Because she was also serving a big all girl party next to us? \n\nOur food came out way before our drinks. My husband and I shared the rib-eye, $58 to share. We must've had too many drinks because we didn't realize it was only 12 oz to share. Cooked medium rare but it was tough and chewy. There were more roasted vegetables nicely spread over the plate than meat. $58 for roasted vegetables and some meat to share. That plate was definitely not worth the price or the wait. They should probably take that off their menu. \n\nWe also ordered the Brussel sprouts which were good.\n\nOverall, it was A restaurant experience I didn't want the day of my birthday. Should've stayed at the Loquita bar and watch the bartenders work. That's a show.","3837":"Visited this restaurant with a group. The ambience is cute though not spectacular. The food tastes were all on point. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. \n\nMy only gripe is that as a \"sharing\" family style restaurant the potions are lacking. Even the platters that are meant to serve several people are quite tiny. The amount of food--per plate--is quite a joke and can make for a costly experience if you're not aware. Seemed like the food is served on LARGE plate but it is either spread out or pushed to one side. It makes for a lovely presentation but an unsatisfactory meal. Thankfully we weren't very hungry so the sampler bites from each plate worked out well! \n\nAs for cocktails, the mule tasted great. It may have been better in a copper mug ;)","3838":"Really enjoyed the Lark. Service was outstanding and the food was very good. However, the Tuna Crudo was light on the Tuna and more heavy on the extras. That's the only thing that was underwhelming. Bar service was great as was the food presentation on their unique shared plates.","3839":"Not satisfied. That's the summary of our dinner at The Lark. The concept is something different and a good idea, but the prices are pretty high for that kind of experience. The servings were pretty small, the different food arrived one after another, so I was already through when my girlfriend just got hers. A friend of ours wanted some fries as side as she recognised that the dish itself was pretty small, it came when all of us were finished...\nSorry, but there are way better ways to have a dinner in Santa Barbara without having to book a table.","3840":"Definitely a new Santa Barbara hot spot.  The Lark was already crowded when we got there at 6 and got packed by the time we finished.  Very cool place and a great vibe.  The food is plated for family style eating.  Everything was a little in the a salty side but otherwise pretty tasty.  Come for the drinks and atmosphere.  Have the brussel sprouts.  Not sure if I'd agree with all the hype but a fun place to go.","3841":"I literally cannot write a review that would do this place justice. \n\nI can't even try.\n\nBut please go. It's so amazing and it will enhance the quality of your life.","3842":"Good foods, free valet with validation, nice ambiance. Came on a christmas eve and they were busy. We had a reservation so we were seated right away, but we didn't expect to be seated outside. There were heaters and fireplace but it's still pretty cold since we didn't dress to be seated outside. Anyway, on to the foods! They give complimentary spiced popcorns as snacks. Some of it are a bit bitter. We ordered:\n- crispy brussel sprouts(good, crispy, sweet and sour, perfect balance!)\n- duck confit(the biscuit that comes with it is amazing! The duck is good too, a bit salty if eaten by itself)\n- rack of wild boar(sooooo good! This definitely is the highlight of our meal! The truffle potato that comes with it is really good! The boar is tender and perfectly seasoned)\n\nWe were hoping to get the profiteroles for dessert, but they didn't have it that night. Looking fwd to come back next time we're in the area!","3843":"You get what you pay for - absolutely delicious food.\n\nI've been to the lark several times for special occasions and just recently had my rehearsal dinner in their private back room. As I expected, the food was phenomenal, but what made the night was the amazing service. We had a few servers that helped with our group including 2 that stayed in the room the duration of dinner to serve at the bar. They were excellent.\n\nThe process for booking was easy and Silvia, the Special Event Coordinator, was responsive and helpful. Our guests raved about the marvelous dinner and we were so happy to start our wedding festivities with such an amazing experience.","3844":"A refreshing and out of the ordinary dining experience. The quality of the food and expertise in its preparation are both top notch and presented to the diner in novel and visually engaging ways. The orders come in various sizes and serving styles and everything is meant to be shared. I have been twice now. I was never a fan of beets or Brussels sprouts but now find myself craving those two openers at The Lark. I can't wait to go back and try more of their offerings.","3845":"Love the Lark!  The ambience is very swanky and the people watching is amazing.  If you are looking for chat with interesting, worldly, fun people, this is your place!  Reservations are highly recommended, but if you just waltz in and would like an app and wine, the bar is a great option.  I have been a handful of times and I prefer the bar over the tables.  You MUST try the brussel sprouts and the deviled eggs!  Both are divine.  The staff here is friendly and super attentive.  The only bummer is the wait for a table, but that's common for a new, trendy SB hangout.","3846":"Personally dig the atmosphere and I enjoy their family style servings. Gorgeous job on preparing the dishes. amazing brie cheese. soft octopus. great steak. pasta and risotto delightfully rich. dessert paired with saturn is just too good.","3847":"We went to this restaurant expecting excellent food but were mostly disappointed.  The blend of flavors was heave handed.  For example, there was a very sweet layer of strawberry jelly on the duck liver.  The sweet flavor overpowered the taste of the duck.  My impression is that the chef was trying too hard to produce something unique.","3848":"Fun, progressive place. Good food, a bit expensive in every sense of the word food and drink wise, but delicious.","3849":"For the record. I did not have dinner here. Went straight to the bar and ordered some very fancy libations. The drinks are on point. The ambiance is tres chic. Did order dessert here, some spiked coffee and ice cream sandwich. I would have no problem making the 2 hour drive from LA to SB just for The Lark's ice cream sandwich.","3850":"Wow. The hippest, freshest eatery I have been to in a long time. I will say this, I am a food snob. 100%.  Vancouver has spoiled me with some seriously great restaurants and because of this I'm not easily impressed when it comes to dining out. It is what it is. That said, the Lark in Santa Barbara blew me away. From its super hip environment to the incredible service and amazing food, this restaurant has easily etched its way into my all-time favorites. It's just that good. Eat here.\n\nI had the asparagus salad, deviled eggs, and lamb gnocchi - all mind blowing.\n\nFor more see here - http:\/\/www.thislifeintrips.com\/2-days-in-santa-barbara\/","3851":"6 for 6! Despite dining at the most crowded times, we've never had one glitch and were fortunate to get patio seating. Consistently superb; fabulous dishes, beautiful presentation and an efficient, knowledgeable staff. Each visit we make a point of ordering something new, but the hanger steak is a \"must\" for us.","3852":"This place is Awesome!!!! Great service, wonderful food, and a great dining experience. The oysters were out of this world good! Unique with watermelon...so good! Also had the lamb ribs, the yellow tail, and the wedge salad was easily the best I have ever had! Can not recommend this place enough.","3853":"The food was delicious!  There was a bright and original decor.  Loved the atmosphere.  And the service was top quality! Our server's name was Jazz, and she was so helpful and genuinely sweet. When I go back,  I will request to sit in her section. The food is pricey, but the overall experience makes it worth every penny.","3854":"The female bar tender who served us at the bar was very rude.  However, everything else was great. The food was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.  The jalape\u00f1o popcorn they serve instead of bread is delicious and prevents overfilling before the meal.","3855":"We had a wedding reception in the Pullman Room with 40 people. Countless compliments came in from guests from food and wine to staff and ambiance. Everything was easy and unforgettable from coordination months before to paying the bill at the end. We will be back :)","3856":"Beautiful restaurant with nice outdoor seating as well.  We tried grilled peaches, scallops, and ribs.  The scallops were really well cooked and had a flavorful \"chermoula\" sauce that was great in small quantities but a little overpowering in the amount that was dolloped on top.  The ribs were nice and tender, but the BBQ sauce was a little on the sweet side.  Overall, the food was definitely high quality, and the great service and atmosphere made it a great dining experience.","3857":"Their main entrees are amazing but I was not thrilled with some of our appetizers, including their oysters and scallop crudo dish. The chicken entree and trout was delicious though!","3858":"Whoa! Didn't someone get stabbed here back in 1999? Well, the \"Funk Zone\" sure has changed this part of SB, that's for sure. We couldn't get a rezzie, but we managed to mosie up to the standing-room only table just in the nick of time.\n\nThe four of us shared everything but the standouts were the beets and the pork shank. The wine list is extensive and they accommodate you if you want to try a few different things. It was all wonderful and I hope to return soon.\n\nOur little piece de resistance was running into \"Elaine\" from Sienfeld, and unfortunately, out friend isn't above going to talk with her. Sorry Elaine; for your sake, I hope we don't run into each other again.\n\nAuf.","3859":"Consistently good food, presentation, and service is usually solid but it has lost a step or two in recent months.  Was in not too long ago and got something I didn't order and it felt so unwelcoming to request something different... really made me feel like I wasn't wanted.   Gonna pass for now.","3860":"The food was extraordinary.  For a food with such great food, they seemed to be unprepared for food allergies.  When I discussed my allergies with the server, she said I could have steak or chicken and left it at that. I had to ask if I could have the scallops and she said yes.  When one of my friends asked for devilled eggs, they brought me one.  I asked about the source of the mustard in the eggs.  They were unwilling\/unable to look at the jar.  With the food we did have, it was great.  My dining companions will probably give it five-stars, but I have to warn people with allergies to be vocal about having the food adapted to suit their needs and be careful, because they don't seem to know about all their ingredients.","3861":"Food was less then mediocre. Don't see it lasting long with the surrounding competition","3862":"Wyatt Davidson is the best waiter EVER! He is super friendly and his attention to detail is amazing. There is nothing complain about his service. He can even speak a little mandarin and his great sense of humor keeps us entertained the entire time. Great service!!!","3863":"Never been to a place that combines the sharing of organic and local farm-to-table plates with fine dining so well- It is the perfect mix and great to go with a group and share plates, or to the bar\/large communal bar table to meet others. Very healthy- Local\/organic- Delicious- Decent portions too. Beautiful decor inside and out that is classy without being pretentious. Love the popcorn instead bread- Great idea. Also FYI- Valet parking.","3864":"One of the worst experiences I've had in awhile. I'm used to dealing with snobby LA restaurants but this one takes the cake. Made a reservation weeks in advance for last night. Our wine tour was running a little late so I called to see if I could push the reservation back 30 mins to 7pm and they (Courtney) said yes. When we got there at 7, Courtney conveniently forgot I said 7pm and said there is nothing they can do about our reservation. She said we could wait at the bar and \"if all goes as planned we can squeeze you in at 9pm at the earliest\". You wanted me to hangout at the bar for a minimum of 2 hours in the hopes of getting a table that I already reserved???? Absolutely ridiculous and rude. They said we could walk around the funk zone and they would text me when a table is available around 9. Very annoyed, but I said \"fine\". We got so hungry by 10pm and still did not get a text so we ate somewhere else. BEST DECISION. it is now 22 hours later from my original reservation and still no one has called me that my table is ready. I'm in SB every month for work and we will never try to go here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. Horrible service and attitudes from the hostess and staff.","3865":"An upscale restaurant with a creative menu using locally sourced and grown produce and meats. \n\nWe got there on a Thursday evening without a reservation and were told there was a wait of 2 hours to be seated. There is a community style table for which you don't need a reservation and we were immediately invited to hang out there. \n\nMy concern as a vegetarian is always that my category of foodies are usually ignored in favor of the meat lovers. But I was in for a surprise. For drinks we got a local Pinot Noir and a cocktail (East Beach something....), both were pretty good. The cheeseboard was a great accompaniment though I thought I could have used a couple more crackers. \n\nThe main entree blew me off my feet- roasted cauliflower, caramelized onions, pistachios, a great tasting sauce and cous cous. Who Would've though t! It was excellent and so were my husband's prime rib dish. The kids thought their cheese pizza was pretty yummy too. \n\nAll in all, a great place to dine at, kid and vegetarian friendly. Though I think the vegetarian entree is a new add to the menu. I did not see it in previous reviews where the vegetarians complained of lack of options. I guess the restaurant took them seriously and took care of that one issue. But do make a reservation if you plan to go.","3866":"This is my favorite restaurant at the moment. I find myself having day dreams of the short ribs and the little gem salad. Sadly, I live in the LA area so I'm only able to go here at the most a few times a month. Which is why I was quite disappointed at the treatment I received when I arrived on 10\/15\/16 for a 1730 dinner reservation that I had made on Open Table. When I arrived I found the restaurant was closed for a private event. So, either I made a mistake on the date or as the hostess stated, \"Open Table bumped me when they blocked out the restaurant for the event.\" I was perfectly okay with it either way. The issue I had was the condescending tone the first hostess had when talking with me about the situation. She was truly rude and had no clue as to customer service. Thankfully, the second hostess had a much better demeanor. I typically travel from LA to Santa Barbara at least twice a month specifically to eat at this restaurant and have never been treated so poorly by any staff member there. I'm weighing my thoughts on if I'll be returning.","3867":"Never disappoints\nQuality food\nIf you like to taste food and still feel satisfied this is the place\nAmbiance is ok\nVery courteous servers\nWe had Brussel sprout, roasted beets, rosemary chicken and octopus, octopus was abit over cooked, the rest were perfect. \nIngredients are super delicious \nDefinitely on my list always.","3868":"My girlfriend and I meet most years in Santa Barbara for our birthdays and we decided to go to Lark I had previously been and had loved it so I  made a reservation we arrived and after being seated we were served with a snack of popcorn tossed in herbs and spices,different and tasty, then our waiter Fernando came to take our order we started with caramelized Brussel sprouts tossed with dates, omg they were delicious we were served our second course which was half a roasted chicken on top of delectable veggies and mashed potatoes,so delicious, but enough for 3 or 4 people. During the meal our waiter Fernando, from Peru attended to us like we were his only table.  Which of course was not true.  The placed was packed.  We then were given a incredible dessert for our birthdays an ice cream sandwich with pecan sauce it was delectable and we could not finish it.  We both loved the experience and hope to meet here soon ! Fernando and Lark thank you for making our birthday night special","3869":"I went to The Lark with my boyfriend for dinner last night. The service was great and the restaurant space is beautiful, but these were The Lark's only redeeming qualities. \n\nFor such a pretentious menu, we were expecting to be blown away by the food. Instead, we shared three dishes (the liver and waffles, beef cheeks, and peanut butter mousse dessert) and we were disappointed with each one. The liver was fine, but the accompanying marmalade was overwhelming. The beef cheeks were tender, but extremely bland. The peanut butter mousse was oversalted and the caramel popcorn chunks in the dessert were nearly impossible to break apart. \n\nPerhaps we unluckily ordered the only three poor dishes on the menu. I doubt we'll be back to test that theory.","3870":"What a great spot! My wife and I just sat down at the bar for cocktails. Such a cool vibe here. Will return someday for the food","3871":"I am absolutely not adversed to ever spending money on food. I live to eat! I Came to Santa Barbra for a staycation and was ready to live it up. Lark was highly rated on Yelp as well as a restauranteur magazine and seemed to be the creme of the crop for Funk Town. However the lark left me disappointed with a lot to be desired. \nService: decent. Seated on time. Food came out in a timely manner. Server was accommodating. \nFood: First of all, to call their food family style is irresponsible. This is tapas portion and should be represented as so. We started off with Devils eggs. It was decent. (However, I am spoiled and have had really spectacular devil's egg at Nick's in Laguna beach and so it did not wow me.) Lark's devil's egg lacked just a little extra texture or crunch that the pancetta just couldn't cover. Then we got the asparagus with poached egg and saffron pine nuts. This was actually sumptuous and had my interest. But for the price it did not match the taste. Our next course was the grilled shrimp and clams with pur\u00e9e potatoes. The shrimp had a good bite but the potatoes and grilled leeks was the star. But I was not blown away. It needed a little heat to cut through the single note that it provided. We end up asking for fresh jalape\u00f1os which they were kind enough to provide when asked. Then came the pork belly dish with peanut brittle, fried pig ears, and grilled stone fruit. Major disappointment. A true chef and lover of pork belly should know it is all about ratio. Crispy skin, tender fat, and favorable meat. This was just fat blubber. To top it off is an awful fruit sauce that tasted like children's liquid Tylenol. Then the peanut brittle was yummy but did not make sense on the dish, kind of an after thought. The pigs ear is the only redeeming quality. However if you go to a butcher, pigs ear and fat cost next to nothing, and the taste does not justify the upsell for this dish. Skip it. \nOverall thoughts: love high end restaurants when I leave feeling satisfied and the recipient of a dining experience that is worthwhile or memorable. However, Lark did not live up to the hype and has some growing to do. Pretentious does not equate to delicious. They can take note from more experienced restaurants like Marche moderne.","3872":"We went there on Cheesecake Day because it was one of the few places with cheesecake in SB when we Googled.  It was 5:10 PM and they offered us the bar, which did not have individual tables, but rather a normal bar and a giant communal table.  We found 2 empty seats and it was not ... welcoming. We decided to leave.  As we were walking away, I thought we might ask them for 2 pieces of cheesecake to go.  We went back and asked.  They said no because they \"did not have the time\".   We won't be back. We ended up at Lilac Patisserie, which had a line out the door but the cheesecake was outstanding.","3873":"Went to the lark while visiting Santa Barbara last week based on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area.  I am so happy we went as everything from the decor, drinks and food was top notch.  The popcorn that they put out on the table in place of bread is not only adorable, but something I will be craving.  It was so good, wish I asked what it was seasoned with!!Started out our meal with the brussel sprouts which were good but not as good as hyped up to be, the wedge salad which I can honestly say is one of the better salads I have ever had, (my boyfriend and I cleaned that plate) and then we had the half roast chicken which was also delicious.  I will say I feel like it was too much food only reason 4 stars is the waiter slightly pressured us that it might not be enough food when honestly the salad and chicken would have been more then plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely recommend the lark to anyone in Santa Barbara it's in a great location and the food and service were both excellent!  Enjoy!","3874":"Over sauced, over seasoned terrible food.  I have to give the restaurant props though bc it was packed and they are definitely killing it.   I seriously don't understand why.  I had such high hopes for this place.  Never again.\n\nServer was nice.  She was the highlight of the evening.","3875":"Great food and atmosphere. We sat in a little garden area and it was beautiful. Very intimate and food came promptly! We've been back a few times already and it has been great each time!","3876":"We were referred by multiple friends to come here. Made reservations for 8:15. If your using the yelp maps for some reason the back of the building is tagged as the front door. The main entrance is next to the lucky penny. \nPlace was PACKED . They literally shoe horn people in . But we were seated fairly quick, pretty loud but we could still carry on a conversation. The waitress , Miranda greeted us quick and got waters almost immediate. In stead of bread they do popcorn. She made it sound like they had different flavors but she gave us sea salt . I probably could have ate that all night . \nWe started with the Brussel sprouts after everyone raving in there reviews. Welp it's true they are amazing! A definite must get. Not like any brussel sprout you have had before. \n\nFor the main.  I ordered beef ribs , she warms that that they are spicy and peppery. But I thought they were perfect! My wife ordered cauliflower couse couse. She wasn't the biggest fan of it. Meals we pretty large I can now see why they say family style ordering. I had read some reviews earlier about people saying portions were small maybe they change some things up but our plates were just short of massive . \n\nFor desert I went with cookie sandwich . That did not disappoint as well.\n\nThis place has three money signs. $$$. Which I have to disagree with. Our whole meal was under 100.00 (before tip) I'm not sure what people are complaining about I think it's definitely worth the value and the service 5 stars would definitely come back.","3877":"4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this place. The location is great - very walkable. We walked from Stearns Wharf through the funk zone, and afterwards up State Street. \n\nThe food is really tasty, too.  The brussels sprouts for a real treat. They were made with dates and some sort of fish sauce. I don't generally like dates but the glaciers went really well together. Every table around us had an order of those Brussels sprouts. We ordered five dishes and it would be hard NOT to order 3 of the five if we went back: the Brussels sprouts, the grilled peach salad, and the porchetta and burrata. \n\nThe reasons I wouldn't give The Lark 5 - we tried a couple specialty cocktails, and they weren't great. But more than that, in the crevice between the table and the table stand were crumbs from previous diners and meals. For a place as nice as The Lark, you just don't expect to see that.","3878":"Excellent place. The staff is so nice and helpful. The atmosphere and design of the place is very homely like and intimate with a hip vibe to it. It's a shared meal type of restaurant. We got four courses. The appetizer was some sort of beet salad. You can till they were picked fresh from a garden because the freshness of the beet was so clean tasting. Then we had some kind of burrata salad and again the the veggies were so clean tasting. Next course was this pork belly dish that you had to eat with all this different ingredients that included a brittle of some kind (amazing). Last was the bone marrow with beef cheeks. By the last couse we were stuffed but it was soooo good we had to finish it. I spent a lil over $100 buck. Well worth it. Definitely coming back!","3879":"This is a very trendy hip casual bar restaurant. Good vibe. Slightly away from the hubbub of State st downtown. The cocktails are interesting. Durango , 100% sezarac are good choices. Brussels sprouts are a good starter. We ordered duck wings confit and short ribs. They are okay. Short ribs had a very salty rub on them which I did not like too much. The service is great. Indoor and outdoor seating.","3880":"Just ate at the Lark for the 5th time this past Friday (4\/3\/2015) and this review is long overdue. I went for my anniversary and notified them beforehand, since they are always so busy I wanted to see if maybe I could get a favorable table location. They did that and much much more. When we got there we were greeted with a hand written note thanking us for choosing the lark for our anniversary. We sat down to some champagne, and they even paid for our desserts! I can not thank them enough for how great of an evening it was for us. This is without even talking about the food. \n\nWe started with oysters, amazing\n\nNext was House Made Porchetta Di Testa (Melt in your mouth good) This was my girlfriends favorite dish. \n\nThen Pineapple & Habanero Glazed Spanish Octopus: This was the only dish we had different thoughts on. Personally I really liked it, I could see how it wouldn't be for everyone as some of the charred octopus came off a little bitter. \n\nBone Marrow Crusted Beef Cheeks the richest of all the dishes, tasted amazing would be part of my last meal menu. Truly a treat, would not get every-time because I have to imagine this would lead to an early grave. \n\n\n\nThanks again guys was an amazing night!","3881":"Started well with the brussell sprouts but the rest was terrible\n\nA nice buzzy atmosphere but we would describe the menu as insecure. Sometimes chefs will combine flavours that you don't expect to gel and it works. In this case all dishes failed\n\nWho needs sausage AND fresh celery chunks AND stewed celery plus more random flavours to complement a beautiful piece of fish. The shrimp bisque would have been enough.\n\nHorrid waste of money. We have eaten in the best neighbourhood restaurants all over the world and this one is one of the worst we have ever tried. I really don't understand the hype","3882":"My favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara! The Brussels are sprouts are amazing. Do not come her and not get them.","3883":"Holy cow, I can't say enough good things about this place. The ambiance is fantastic, the service was perfect, and the food is just at the next level.\n\nI even made a mistake on my bill; I had written an appropriate gratuity, and then accidentally added WAY more when adding up my total. (Yes, we had been wine tasting.) I didn't remember it until the next morning, so I thought I'd just try to let it go; but they ended up charging me the lesser amount! The waitress must have seen that my mistake was the total and not the tip amount. That was just the cherry on top of an excellent service.\n\nThe Lark would've gotten five stars from me regardless, but now I wish I could give them six.","3884":"I waited a long time to try this place, since the hype began before it even opened.  The service was amazingly...stiff.  I did not feel like i was in Santa Barbara but rather some Bel Air place my in-laws (if i had any) would take me to show me how much money they have.  The food was nice.  nice enough if my would-be-in-laws had paid the bill which topped $240 for two people, one cocktail each, and a $40 bottle of wine.  No appetizer.  Oh, right, one appetizer that was good enough for an infant!","3885":"I wish I remembered our servers name - she was hands down the best server we've ever had...which says a lot, as my husband and I have 20+ years of experience in the industry. She knew EVERY detail and was so kind and just helpful enough, but not overbearing. \nThe food was incredible and the ambiance as well. \nWe can't wait to go back - and everyone we recommend the pace to is so happy they went!","3886":"If I could give this place 6 stars, solely based on their appetizers and drinks (cause that's all I had\/all the room my stomach could handle), I totally would. \nFor drinks, had the Old Aztec. I highly highly recommend it, especially if you love whisky, and especially if you love Old Fashioneds. The Old Aztec is a little milder than your typical old fashioned, but definitely isn't lacking in any way shape or form. \nThe deviled eggs are really great...and I don't even like deviled eggs to begin with. If I can eat their deviled eggs then you know it's good. \nThe Brussel sprouts, oh my God. Hands down, hands down, the best Brussel sprouts I have ever had. Crispy, delicious, cooked to perfection in a special sauce and dates. So delicious. \nWish I had room for their main courses, but maybe next time. Can't speak of their main dishes obviously at this time, but I have only heard great things! \n\nWaiters and waitresses: top notch awesome people who are great at having conversation. \n\nWhat's great about this place is that they have a communal table, which is first come first serve. Gives you a great opportunity to make friends with total strangers sitting next to you, and even share plates!\n\nLoved this place. 6 stars if I may!","3887":"We loved our dinner at The Lark! So many interesting preparations. The Brussels sprouts were unlike any we had ever had and they were delicious! Excellent wedge salad, rosemary brown butter cornbread with chili butter, and porchetta with crispy chilies. The pappardelle with English peas, snap peas, wood ear mushrooms, truffle, parmesan and pine nuts was the star of our dinner. Beautiful color and flavors.","3888":"I am giving the restaurant 5 stars not just for the food and atmosphere, but primary due to the excellent service provided to us by Samantha. She was an awesome  server. She was polite and on top of her game even though the place to full. She did not try to rush us out of the place in order to get another party at the table. She actually held appropriate conversations with us and others around us. Furthermore, the manner that she described the flavors when we asked about the items was amazing. All the items that we ordered were dead on the way she described them. \n\nThe atmosphere is awesome. We sat inside but the outside area was adorable. To be honest you will comfortable either indoors or outdoors. We enjoyed the artwork on the walls as well. \n\nAs for the food, the flavors are amazing. Be prepared for your mouth to experience unique and sophisticated multi levels of flavors. Our favorite dish was the lamb ribs. The spices used in the dry rub was something like we never had before. When you add the sauce to the ribs it changed the dynamic of the flavor to another level. Kudos to the chef and the staff.","3889":"We had an excellent meal here but the service was lacking. We arrived about an hour before closing and were sat at the communal table inside as we intended only to get a few apps and drinks rather than entrees. The hostess let us seat ourselves and then didn't come back to bring us menus for over 5 minutes. It was a Tuesday night, there were many servers bustling but it was not busy\/full at all and we were mostly ignored and this continued throughout the meal. From the time we finished eating until they came to clear our plates and offer dessert menus was roughly 20 minutes. We had the lamb tartare, duck confit, and some kind of chocolate-y dessert with passion fruit ice cream, which was an odd combination to us but still very tasty. I came back a couple of weeks later with a 6pm reservation on a Friday night to celebrate Mother's Day and the service was much better and the food was incredible, maybe the first time I was there was just an off night.","3890":"Great ambiance, drinks and food. I came on a Friday night with no reservations and was seated right away. Friendly staff and a nice selection of wine and food. The seafood stuck out to me and i ordered the clams, vegetable salad and scallops. Although smaller portions for a family style restaurant, i was very full and satisfied with the meal.","3891":"I came here just for a fun night with the family, and to be honest, this is the spot to be in Santa Barbara if you're looking for good people, good atmosphere, and great drinks. My family ordered a lot of different drinks and food, and to be completely frank, we were a hassle to deal with just because our party was so big. \n\nInitially I thought that we would be too much to handle, but The Lark staff provided gracious service and genuine concern when we needed something. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The overall vibe is super trendy with good-looking people and super modern lighting with a mix of rustic features.","3892":"Every dish was carefully thought out, making each bite truly\n heavenly. Plenty of staff with excellent service.","3893":"Best restaurant we've been to in a while.  My family and I ordered 7 things from the menu and they were all delicious.  I can't say I have a favorite dish because everything was superb!! The balance on each plate was remarkable.  \n\nThe staff was also terrific.  They were friendly and attentive.  We went for an early Thursday dinner which was a great time because it wasn't super packed.  We noticed that the wait was getting long as the evening continued so we were glad we made reservations in advance.  I'd drive to Santa Barbara again just to eat here!","3894":"This restaurant is amazing. We came here to celebrate our anniversary: the staff was friendly, food beyond great, and the environment was exceptional. Looking forward to coming here again.","3895":"The food was off the hook amazing. Presentation. Everything. Next time I'm in Santa Barbara, we are coming back!","3896":"Great food, great ambiance and great service from the valet to your table host. I was impressed with the way every dish even the most basic ones like the grilled Brussel sprouts were accentuated with a happy marriage of flavors (in this case the Brussel sprouts were grilled with fish sauce and garnished with caramelized dates) A flavorful twist! They start you off with seasoned popcorn, also unexpected. I tried the cheese plate, and the scallop dish paired with Israeli couscous. Very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The place is trendy, and perfect for a group dinner or date.","3897":"5 stars for the whole experience! It was great from the valet, host, environment, server, drinks and food! I had the Gnocchi wich was really flavorful and my favorite, and the Jidori chicken and all the elements that came with it were delicious. The hamachi was ok, I felt the fish was sliced too thick. I definitely will be back and looking forward to it!","3898":"Everything was good here, but it was primarily the pork belly dish that stood out. It was definitely a nice surprise on our recent trip to Santa Barbara. Everything was well-executed, bringing out multiple flavors in each dish. There was also a tendency to use fruit in every dish we ordered, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe smoked heritage pork belly was our favorite. The pork belly was done very well, soft on the inside with a crisp exterior. The bourbon and peach glaze gave it the appropriate sweetness and acidity to complement the fatty pork. The dish was also served with a really good peanut brittle whose sweetness and textural contrast made it even more interesting. The crispy pig ears provided extra crispiness to the dish. We could have easily ordered another one that same day.\n\nThe Dungeness crab gnocchi dish was our second favorite. The Dungeness crab was good and went well with the Parisian style flour-based gnocchi, which is not as dense as Italian potato-based gnocchi but still more dense than regular pasta. The lobster roe on top added a great savoriness to the dish. This dish was definitely more muted and monotone than the pork belly dish, but we still enjoyed it, though at the end, the gnocchi did start to feel more heavy.\n\nThe grilled Spanish octopus was good but our least favorite. The octopus was very soft and had a bit of charred taste but was more subtle in flavor. Unfortunately, everything else on the plate was actually better than the octopus itself as there was roasted cauliflower, blistered grape, sea beans, toasted almonds and grapefruit on the plate. Most of this stuff had more flavor than the octopus, making the dish feel more like a vegetable dish than an entree. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a small plates restaurant and find yourself near the Santa Barbara area, this restaurant is very good, on par with several of the better restaurants in the Los Angeles area, and is worth trying out.","3899":"Super trendy for SB. A very LA restaurant. It wasn't as bougie as I thought it would be. Prices were reasonable. Only went there for drinks with some friends. Our waitress was so nice but service was incredibly slow. I got the Hummingbird, which was pretty good. I think the best drink though was The Mule, which my friend got. The house popcorn was yummy too. I want to try going there do dinner, the menu looked interesting!","3900":"So I now have a new favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. The Lark was amazing. A great menu and wine list (try the Gamay by the glass paired with the Ocean Mist Farm broccoli with blood orange and roasted walnut dukkah!). The salmon was cooked perfectly ... and I'm very picky with salmon. Don, our server, delivered impeccable service with just the right amount of attentiveness and conversation without interrupting. Great vibe, and we enjoyed some nice jazz at Les Marchands wine bar after dinner (we were less impressed with the service at LM, but the music was fantastic). A perfect evening.","3901":"We had the lamb shank which fell of the bone and melted in the mouth, the crab gnocchi which I would divorce my husband for and some lovely steak and broccoli.\n\nThe staff were knowledgable and attentive without being over bearing. We sampled and ordered several local wines and a rather tasty sherry to finish the meal.\n\nLark is not cheap but the portions are generous and we have plenty of leftovers to take home.","3902":"Definitely an amazing experience. \n\nOur waitress & the host were very friendly, and our waitress was on top of everything. Everything we ordered was recommended by our waitress. We also got a complimentary dessert for my boyfriend's birthday. It was a very nice touch. \n\nOur order:\nThe brussels sprouts: super good, definitely squeeze that lime.\n\nThe octopus: it was great. It had a little kick of spice to it. The tentacles had an interesting texture, but were good. \n\nThe trout: by far our favorite dish. It was perfect, but we were not a fan of the cauliflower. \n\nThe dark chocolate ganache: different mix of flavors. Definitely a great dessert for a dark chocolate lover. \n\nOverall it was amazing. I definitely recommend anyone to go and try it out for themselves. Make sure to make a reservation!","3903":"This place is great.  I like the fire pits around the patio.  \n\nThis is my first review because I am 7 years old!\n\nSorry if I spelled something wrong.\n\nOlivia -","3904":"The prices aren't over the top there's a lot of wonderful choices. You need to try this place!","3905":"Before visiting Santa Barbara, I did some research about what restaurants to visit. This was at the top of the list.\n\nAfter a day of wine tasting, we were looking forward to great food. The main courses were underwhelming and so were the drinks. \n\nThe only 2 dishes we liked were appetizers: the Brussel sprouts & oysters.\n\nIt's definitely trendy and hip. I give this place 3 stars for appetizers and ambiance.","3906":"I NEVER write reviews except for this. We had a large table of eight people and the dishes itself were phenomenal. However, the service was beyond disbelief. The server at the beginning was very insightful and obviously considerate as we were a large table. He then continued to insert his political viewpoints toward all of eight of us when he overheard a discussion while pouring drinks at the table. He felt very hurt that our views did not agree with his that he called upon another server to continue waiting upon us the rest of the time. When a member of our table went up to speak with him and apologize for being hurt he said \"I do not have time for you.\" As a past waiter myself, this is very very unprofessional. You are not there to impose your view points on a large group of people who are paying you to do your job. I am very disappointed in the service at this restaurant and will never be dining here again because of this.","3907":"Went here for my birthday on a Saturday night. Nolan was out server and did an amazing job! He was attentive and was great at explaining the menu and how it worked. We ordered the Brussels Sprouts and Ribeye just to name a few and everything was excellent! Wyatt( not sure if the spelling is right) who was also an employee there was so nice and took care of us by taking pictures for us haha and making sure we were accommodated in every way- thank you so much!! Great experience at this place and would recommend to anyone visiting Santa Barbara.","3908":"I was excited to try The Lark as I had heard it was excellent, unfortunately I thought it was just good. The brussels sprouts with dates was tasty. The honey glazed carrots was just ok. I had read on Yelp that the hanger steak was great, but there was more broccoli in the plate than meat, however it did have a good kick. Our main dish was the Arctic char which was delicious. We also ordered the cheesecake which I really liked. The service was good, but it was really loud and I felt that a little cramped.","3909":"Service was excellent and they went above and beyond when we told them we had theater tickets.  They just kept bringing plates out!  They also added on an item to the plates that had only three items since we were a table of four.\n\nDo not turn down the popcorn they serve you with your drinks!  Best popcorn I've ever had.  I like the lime salt in it with all of the other seasonings and spices.\n\nNothing we had was horrible.  Here is what we tried (everything is family style):\n-Fried Castelvetrano Olives stuffed with goat cheese & rosemary with chorizo - very good\n-Deviled Eggs - seemed like they were pre made, but still tasted good.\n-Brussel Sprouts - delicious\n-Cauliflower Gratin\n-Beets Salad - I'm not a huge beets fan but the others raved about it\n-Wedge Salad - not your typical wedge!  The bacon was delicious!\n-Kale Salad - tasty\n-Pork Belly Sliders - good substance, tasty\n-Herb Roasted Scallops - prepared perfectly!  Moist but not undercooked.\n\nWith a few drinks each, I think the bill was maybe $250 total.  \n\nYou need to make reservations!!!  \n\nParking is street or in the lot which is small.\n\nWe sat outside, which was nice for a warm evening in October.  Very good ambiance and vine outside.  There are heat lamps.  Inside had a lot more tables, and bars.\n\nDress is casual but not shorts and flip flops.  I can see it being slightly more upscale on the weekends.\n\nThe Lark is definitely a place if you want an upscale, trendy dinner experience.","3910":"We celebrated our 10-year Anniversary here, and had the best experience. Our waiter, Bill, was exceptional and the service was professional and anything but pretentious. We enjoyed all of Bill's food recommendations and our cocktail was sublime. The food we had was completely sensational and a mark of culinary brilliance.","3911":"Well below expectations. OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL - were bland, sitting in water and not their own liquor. ELLWOOD FARMS MELON & CUCUMBER - Great idea, poorly executed. Honeydew and cantaloupe were mushy and should not have been used. DUNGENESS CRAB & HOUSEMADE GNOCCHI - fantastic. Crab was fresh and the gnocchi was creamy. 1 for 3 may be good for a batting average, but not for dinner at these prices.","3912":"We so enjoyed our meal at The Lark - what a great find! The atmosphere is lovely and warm, with lots of beautiful textures. Our server was just the right balance of familiar and attentive and made great recommendations for wine pairings. \nThe Rosemary cornbread was LIFE changing. The Brussels sprouts were the best we've had anywhere, and the entrees (harissa chicken and homemade pappardelle with mushrooms, squash, and pomegranate seeds) offered a really beautiful flavor complexity. \nWe live in LA, but will come back to SB just to eat here! Highly recommended.","3913":"This is always a great food experience. Must haves: Brussel  Sprouts, Hamachi and the Mary's chicken with black pepper grits. Everything is amazing!  Still one of the most happening spots in SB and right in the middle of the funk zone.","3914":"The go to dinner spot when in the Funk Zone or Santa Barbara. Everything was amazing starting with the corn bread, garden of Salanova lettuces and  finally, the ribs.","3915":"This place was awful. Their menu attempts to be fancy but they add the weirdest ingredients to ruin each dish. \n\nI ended up ordering JUST a pretzel because you can't go wrong with a pretzel right? Wrong. Their mustard was disgustingly hot, and the mustard tasted like cigarettes.\n\nWe also brought a cake for our friend's birthday and they charged a $30 cake fee for some dickwad to bring out half of our cake THAT WE BROUGHT and we never got the other half. \n\nStaff was nice, food was terrible, and their practices were silly. I can't wait to order a pizza right now so I can enjoy some food.  \n\nGo away from here. They are trying to be some fancy dinner place but it's just a total waste of money.","3916":"My friend and I had a wonderful experience from the moment we stepped in the restaurant. THE POPCORN WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD! !!servers were on point and  i noticed that they were so interactive with the customers-- including us!! We tried  two appetizers-- fried green tomatoes and brussel  sprouts, a wedge salad, hamachi crudo (for me!!), and  pork belly.  I swear it's a whole lotta food  but its SOO GOOD!!!  I would definitely  come back. Its best to make reservations  cuz it gets pretty busy.","3917":"I love the Lark. I love everything about this place, the service, the food and the ambiance. We tend to only dine here when we are celebrating Birthday or Anniversary, but we always go all out. We order one item per category and just share which they reccomend you do. They change the menu frequently and that's what I love about it even more. They keep some items all the time like their Brussels sprouts which are to die for. The staff is incredibly friendly as well and have accommodated special requests as well with the Anniversary and B-day celebrations. Already can't wait for our next visit!","3918":"The food was amazing also the service is outstanding as well.  I have a food allergy and everyone went out of their way to accommodate me so that I could enjoy my food as well.","3919":"Precious hidden gem that serves complicated flavors beautifully. Overall experience  was great, waiters very gracious. Just the kitchen was slightly slow on bringing out the dishes. The Lucky Penny pizzas next door were also delicious.","3920":"We heard about all the rage and that something new was in town. I would say that decorating, style, and overall ambience blows anything in Santa Barbara out of the water. I thought the food was good but nothing to rave about. We had the cheese platter which was excellent, the deviled eggs which were blah, the blue cheese wedge salad which was blah, and the mini sliders which were a whole lot of bread and little meat and sauce.  I think I will give it a second chance but I think I would try other restaurants first before going back.\n\nThe wait staff was very nice and professional.","3921":"Last night we had the pleasure of having dinner here. First, when I made the reservation they asked if I was celebrating anything. I said yes our 35 th anniversary. As soon as we were seated at our table I noticed there was a card with a note congratulating us. Then someone brought a complimentary glass of champagne. Such a nice touch!! The ambiance is very trendy and tasteful. We had a great waitress who's name I can't remember (had blonde dreadlocks). She was so pleasant and helpful. We started out with Brussel sprouts which my husband normally hates. They were the best I have ever tasted!!! Even my husband liked them. He had the wedge which was also great. We them got the Octopus and Skirt steak larger plates to share. OMG just perfection. They encourage shared plates. Also, when you first order your drink ask to try some popcorn. It's to die for!!! If you are in Santa Barbara do yourself a favor and eat at The Lark. You will not be sorry","3922":"An AMAZING restaurant! Perfect ambiance, incredibly friendly staff, delicious food. What more could I ask for? From the moment we walked through the door, their customer service  was impeccable. We gave our name and reservation times to the hostesses (both super sweet and warm) and were seated immediately. Our server's name was Louie and he was the nicest guy and gave amazing recommendations. We had the smoked persimmon and burrata salad, grilled hanger steak, and strozzapreti pasta. All the dishes were amazing, definite 5\/5 star rating for taste! Burrata salad was a hearty portion with delightful flavors mixed within, the hanger steak was a bit small for our appetites but the taste was all there, and the strozzapreti pasta is also a variety of delicious flavors but heavy on the goat taste so if you don't like the goat\/lamb taste, I wouldn't order the pasta dish. Can't wait to come back again!","3923":"Mel was the best server!!! Make sure to request her.  Service, food & atmosphere was perfect.","3924":"World Class food and service.\n\nThe menu changes with each season. This ensures that there is always something new, and they Only use the Best ingredients that are in season.\n\nWith this seasonal menu it also keeps the chiefs sharp and creative.\nYou can see, smell, and taste the passion for cuisine that the creators have.\n\nEveryone of the staff you can tell loves their job.\n\nI'll try to come back every menu change because I'm floored by every dish I have had here.\n\nAmazing drinks, great ambiance. World Class dinning.\nCan't gush enough, my favorite restaurant.","3925":"I'm glad my friend recommended this place as it's in a good area with a lot of things around to do after dinner. \n\nMake your dinner reservations early if you want to get a seat. We overheard the hostess telling someone it'll be a 2 hour wait. (Seriously?) I guess that's how popular it is on a Saturday night. And it's probably because the food was sooo good! \n\nThe menu is such a fun menu to order from. The entrees and small plates are all meant for sharing as you'll be disappointed if you didn't... portions are on the fancier and smaller side. We ordered: \n\n-Hamachi crudo\n-Brussels sprouts\n-Duck confit\n-Wagyu flatiron\n-Diver Scallops\n-Grilled octopus\n\nIt all was amazing. Exquisite and unique flavors for a lot of the dishes. My favorite was their Brussels sprouts and the wagyu flatiron and diver scallops. The drinks were also very good and strong. I had the mule and the JP Paloma. Dessert on the other hand was super too weird for me. It was good though but I felt they were too much, like one dessert they put coffee grinds all over... felt like I was eating ash. The other 2 desserts were still very good. \n\nService was superb. Our server was really accommodating and cool. I would definitely come  back and try other items if I had the chance! When we left, it was still super packed around 10pm.","3926":"Such a great experience. Some of the best food I had in Santa Barbara for sure! The dessert was really great!!!! Friendly atmosphere and great service as well.","3927":"Excellent service and delicious cocktails! Only a couple of small misses for me; one, we never received the house popcorn that our server said he'd send out, and two, I wish the ribeye dish had been served with some sort of savory sauce for the meat. It came with a tart, mustard vinaigrette that was great on the veggies but not so great on the meat itself. I mentioned this to our server, who said he'd ask the kitchen if there was something they could make. Alas, he returned unsuccessful but I give him major kudos for trying! He was awesome, so overall it was a wonderful meal and I'd definitely return.","3928":"Best and most culinary creative restaurant in SB. Reservations are highly encouraged as they are booked months out sometimes. They are right next to a brewery and a wine tasting room which is fun. The Lark has really good cocktails and mouth watering seasonal food - their menu changes seasonally.","3929":"Packed every time I've been.  High energy and not for the people looking for an intimate experience but really fun.  I'd love to see more high end old world wine on the list but I understand the support of local growers and a more modest price point in general.  I haven't been in a long while now so it will be interesting to see what it's like next time I'm in town.  \nI highly recommend going.","3930":"Came here for my birthday dinner, got incredibly lucky with Bill as our server. Ordered 4 dishes for 5 people (all girls) and all were comfortably full. The brussel sprouts were to die for! And the salt and vinegar popcorn snacks were so bomb :))) we ordered the lamb belly, ocean trout, brussel sprouts, and the salad so bomb!!! Thank you so much Bill for the amazing service!!!","3931":"The food, the service and the atmosphere are all amazing. Excellent restaurant! The staff were very attentive during dinner. The decor is definitely unique and refreshing for Santa Barbara. The quality and the presentation of the food you get for the price is excellent. I recommened you try their burger, it's delicious.","3932":"We were disappointed by our dinner experience here. We were seated in a corner, and one of the seats was in a confessional. It was like being seated in a cupboard. It was very bizarre and got quite hot during our dinner.\n\nWhile our waitress was nice, she recommended that we order too much food and was misleading when she described portion sizes. We ended up ordering far too much food. \n\nThe food was barely edible. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, which were soggy and had too much seasoning. Next, we had the local garden vegetables which was covered in a salty lemon dressing. We left the plate mostly untouched. Following those two large-sized courses, we were served the zucchini. We took two bites of this dish and couldn't eat anymore. The zucchini were covered in cumin and were overlooked. At this point, we considered canceling our last dish, which was the scallops. When these finally arrived, they were overlooked and served on a bed of couscous which tasted like salty mush. \n\nThe service was chaotic and disorganized. The restaurant felt noisy and chaotic. \n\nThis dining experience was not at all what we had anticipated and we were very disappointed. I would not recommend.","3933":"Maybe it was because of the stormy weekend, but we were able to get a dinner time reservation very easily last night.  There were no more indoor tables except the community table and bar so we chose to tempt the weather on the patio.  That was a great choice.  Reviews citing the noise level were obviously not written from the patio experience.  \nThe woman taking my reservation explained about the copious number of heaters, which turned out to be almost over kill.  The one above our table required that I kept my hat on to protect my head.  If it is not raining, the patio should be explored for your experience here without the fear of being chilled.\nWe didn't realize that food is served family style so once that was explained the menu made more sense and the experience was fun.  The service was splendid, I think we had a total of five different people taking care of our table but they were not intrusive.  \nThe four rather than five stars are because the salads came out before the appetizer and the appetizer was oversized, but very good.  \nThe Lark's take on a wedge salad is tasty and a little different without the tomatoes and onions, with pork belly rather than bacon.  The vegan writer was correct, this probably isn't the place for you, but there are plenty of others.  The crab salad needs to be swirled through the bottom of the dish to pick up all the flavors or it will be a little bland. \nOverall it was a very pleasant dining experience.  Take advantage of the free valet parking service as well.  The young men doing it are very nice and took good care with our car.  The area can be very crowded so don't waste your time looking for parking, let them do it for the cost of a tip.","3934":"Amazing food and great service \nI have no words to say except \nGo visit and enjoy in Santa Barbara \nGreat dinner \nGreat music","3935":"Great food with an interesting menu, in a really eclectic setting, right in the heart of Santa Barbara's Funk Zone.  There is plenty of food to share if you order a main entre item, and the smaller dishes are of ample size with hearty selections.  The wine list is well-conceived, and service was attentive.  Prices are in line with what one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber.","3936":"Had the pleasure of dining here last night and what an amazing experience!  Incredible service, friendly warm atmosphere, and wonderful food.  I loved the small plate\/sharing concept and we enjoyed the kale salad, brussel sprouts ( so good we ordered another portion), short ribs, scallops, macaroni cheese and beet salad.  Every dish was explained in detail as it was served and you can see how much the staff enjoy sharing this wonderful food.\n\nIf you are in SB you HAVE to visit.  I will definitely be returning when I come back to town.","3937":"Had an amazing meal here tonight with two close friends. Started with Brussels Sprouts, then shared the beet & burrata salad and the whole roasted chicken. Amazing. Service top notch, attentive but not over bearing. If I had to complain, I wished they served their water chilled instead of room temperature, and the cocktail could have been a little stronger (The Mule - had a great flavor). Will definitely come back!","3938":"Tried to go to this place at 4:30 this eve for drinks and appetizers, tons of open tables and staff. They said they only had tables open for customers ordering dinner. We ended up going to another place and had a great meal and drinks. And hour and a half later the same stables were still empty. Must be nice to be so high class that you turn away customers. You will never get our business now.","3939":"Fantastic!  Fresh food, creatively prepared. At first glance one might think the menu is a bit boring with standards such as a wedge salad or hangar steak. Oh quite the contrary. The chef adds interesting flavor touches to compliment and yet highlight the main ingredients. For example, the wedge salad had tons of bacon lardons with an herbed vinegarette and smoked blue cheese. The carmelized cauliflower is what I called an adult version of mac n cheese.  While we loved the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and flavorful, the vegan smoked farro & charred lettuces stole the show.  What an amazing combination of flavors and surprisingly filling.  I'd go back just for that dish alone.  \n\nThe service was also on par with the food. Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable about the food and wine list.  \n\nMy only word of caution to diners is that you may be seated inside or outside unless you make a special request.  We had reservations on a hopping Saturday eve and were seated promptly but outside on the patio (which I normally prefer).  I was in a dress not knowing I might be dining al fresco on a rather chilly evening. There are loads of heaters and a couple of fire pits and I'm told a few blankets too. I was fine but for those who run cold, be sure to bring a coat during colder months.\n\nBottom line is this was one of the best dining experiences I have in ages.","3940":"Food was great here and I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. I'm only giving four stars, however, due to the fact that the tables are practically on top of each other. I know restaurants are looking for every way to make more money these days, but it's uncomfortable listening to the couple next to me argue about who's coming over for Easter while I try to enjoy a nice meal with my husband. Spread the tables out please!! For real, the food was great.","3941":"The whole experience was worth every dollar to me. Our waiter to close care to us, made sure every thing that we could want was on hand. Every bit was an experience. One that I will never forget. \n\nIn 2004 a friend of mine took me to a fine restraint in Philadelphia. His father was a chef that knew the chef on staff and I was served the best Duck. For the rest of my life I searched for something that could match that. This chef surpassed that. Never had I had duck that made me weep. 10 out of 10. Expensive but worth every dollar.","3942":"The Lark is just about as good as it gets. Hands down one of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara. Ironically, the chef is from Houston - where I am originally from - but he is an innovative master chef. The menu can come off a bit overwhelming simply because it is so new, innovative, and surprising - but REGARDLESS everything I have ever ordered is tasty and delicious. I am a big fan of the hanger steak, Brussel sprouts, and the gnocchi with Dungeness crab. But as I said no matter what you order - it will be good. The ambiance is trendy, charming, and beautiful arranged. The waiters and waitresses are very knowledgable on the menu and cuisine in general and are always exceptionally friendly. I would not pass up the Lark for anything","3943":"It's interesting to me that on very rare occasion, I've been accused by other Yelpers (establishment owners moving about the website incognito?) of enjoying when I write a bad review, and that couldn't be further from the truth.  I hate when I have to write a less than stellar accounting of my dining experience, and I especially hate when I'm one of only a few who claim a bad experience of mostly 5 star reviews.  Well, thank goodness I'm not alone here, but I am not in the majority, either.  Most people love The Lark.... and I truly wish I was one of them.\n\n I will say the food presentation gets 5 stars.  Every dish was very artistically presented, so much so that I didn't want to cut into the beauty of their design, but we did anyway.  They were all beautiful, and I took pictures of each to make sure I always have them to reference, and nothing pleases me more than having something beautiful to photograph.  This place surely did not disappoint.\n\n The menu was eclectic, if not daring.  I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things, and even dishes with some more unusual food combinations.  Nothing scary or weird, but not my usual cup 'o tea, either.   For instance, gnocchi with crabmeat and chorizo...... to me, not something I'd typically order...or find elsewhere, but it \"could\" have worked masterfully.  The dish also boasted the use of navel oranges, castelvetrano olives, lobster roe, chili flakes and cilantro, but I have no idea if they were actually there or not...... I couldn't tell.  Unfortunately, the dish was overpowered by too many chili flakes (not the chorizo), and thus, was way too spicy.  A dish like gnocchi, so delicate, doesn't seem right that it should be so spicy.  Maybe I'm crazy.\n\n We also ordered an asparagus dish, which came with preserved Meyer lemon, soft poached egg, spicy coppa, pinenuts, summer blossoms.  The asparagus, while cooked to perfection, had absolutely NO flavor, which annoys me to no end.  The spicy coppa was not all that spicy, but it didn't do anything for me to eat it with the asparagus, either.  I don't like poached eggs, so I didn't eat that.  I'm not sure what the summer blossoms were, or IF they were even there.  The pine nuts were more for decoration.  I didn't avail myself to eating them with the asparagus..... or without.  This dish just didn't work for me whatsoever.\n\n We also ordered the slow-cooked lamb ribs that came with Medjool date caramel, salsa verde, crushed pistachio, and fennel pollen.  This was incredibly flavorful, but again, a bit spicy.  Yet, this time, while it was still too spicy for me, at least it made sense with the lamb.  With lamb, it can handle strong flavors.  This definitely had a Middle Eastern flavor, and I loved the sweet, perhaps cinnamon-y flavor.  I just would have preferred it be a little less spicy.  Also, while the lamb fell off the bones quite easily, it was oddly a bit dry.  I was chewing way too long on some of the pieces.\n\n One of the prettier dishes was the stone fruit & burrata, which had pickled bing cherries, nectarines, plums, peaches, with a dollop of roasted cashew praline, set among red mustard greens with Persian lime gastrique.  The fruit, while mildly cooked, was topped with a little dollop of burrata and some of the roasted cashew praline, which pretty much tasted like cashew butter.  The dish was nice to look at, but the flavors didn't appeal to me, nor did they add anything to any of the fruit.  Sure, separately they did...... but not together.  While beautiful to look at, thus ended its appeal after that.\n\n Lastly, we had the Grilled Spanish Octopus with roasted cauliflower, sea beans, blistered grapes, toasted almonds, squid ink, grapefruit, and rosemary.  OUTSTANDING.  It had perfect flavor.  It wasn't overly spicy.  It had texture.  The octopus and cauliflower were wonderful, especially when dipped in the squid ink.  The grapefruit could have been left out, but certainly nothing to detract from the dish.  We all loved it the most, and I'm just sorry we didn't order another.  I think this was my favorite restaurant version of octopus.  They got this dish RIGHT !!\n\n I happened to love my cocktail........ I got their version of the Mule....cucumber infused vodka, yellow chartreuse, and ginger beer with slices of lime and cucumber.  VERY refreshing, tasty, and sweet...... just how I like it.  Speaking of sweet, since it was my birthday, they brought out one of their goat cheese profiteroles with a candle.  It was decent........ not my favorite, but decent.  My husband and daughter ordered funnel cake, but I'm so not a funnel cake fan.  They both liked it, but they weren't raving, either.\n\n So overall, we had some hits and misses.  Honestly, for all the positive press I've read and for the prices they charge, I expected perfection... or near that.  I didn't think it was close to it.  Good, yes... but GREAT?  No way. I'm comfortable with awarding 3 stars.  Wish I could've given more.","3944":"Amazing atmosphere, great service. Would totally go back next time I am in Santa Barbara!","3945":"Our favourite restaurant in Santa Barbara, top three in California!!! You MUST have the cornbread. It's to die for. The Brussels sprouts are also completely Amazing. The scallops and charcuterie dish was disappointing, strange flavours and over seasoned. But the duck confit is excellent also. It's a MUST go if you're in Santa Barbara, make sure you make reservations earlier than a few days otherwise you'll be eating a 10pm, which, is totally still worth it!","3946":"Great dining experience food and cocktails.  Went here for my birthday and got great service but it didn't seen as though staff treated the other patrons any differently (except that I got a cute postcard and many birthday wishes as well as dessert!).  They were all very professional, even down to the bussers.  They give the kind of service where everything is timed just right but you don't see them hovering.  Just a perfect production going on. My favorite dish out of the 6 my husband and I shared was the gnocchi.  Perfect pillowy goodness with amazing tomatoes, crab, sauce and a hint of preserved lemons.  Droooool!","3947":"This place is phenomenal. My wife and I went to Santa Barbara on a weekend getaway and found this restaurant on Yelp. It is very hip and modern and has a really cool atmosphere. The food is such that it is made to share so you can get various dishes and share them with your party. Our favorite dish was actually an appetizer called the House Made Charcuterie board. It was $20 and worth every penny. It was a large appetizer. If you enjoy meat get this dish!","3948":"My wife and I were I Santa Barbara fro few days for my birthday and we ate at the Lark after exploring the Funk Zone. It was packed so we ate at the bar. We had the brussel sprouts and the lamb shank. The brussel sprouts were great. I would got to this restaurant just for those brussel sprouts. The lamb shank was cook perfectly and had great flavor.  The food is served family style and in nice size portions. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Overall we had a great dining experience and would recommended.","3949":"Well, after the hostess kind of screwed up by taking us next door to the other restaurant because we didn't have a reservation, with half her restaurant empty, and informing her we just wanted a quick try of the Scallops and a cocktail, because they were highly recommended by all the neighboring establishments, we had to try... Came back later and tables were STILL open, finally got a seat.  Tessa, our server was excellent,the popcorn was tasty and unique, cocktails were a cut above, the Scallops with chorizo prepared perfectly with a nice blend of favors, excellent, and the dessert carmel chocolate mousse with custom smoked almond brittle, by Nick was the topper. Dan the GM was cordial and accommodating.  We've lived in Santa Barbara for 8 years, never ate at a restaurant good enough to yelp, we'll except San Ysidro Ranch(given though). \nFinally nice to see some unique charm and character from a restaurant, if you want the usual SB yawn, go to pretty much any other spot in town for your stale fried calamari. No need for us to go anywhere else, we're hooked. \nAll staff, except for hostesses, were right on, we'll versed on their products, enthusiastic about working in a nice setting, friendly but professional,good effort.\nThanks for finally getting Santa Barbara on par with SF And NYC.  \nCheers!","3950":"Great food, good ambience and great service!! This place is our go to in Santa Barbara and can't wait to go back!  The drinks are the best!!","3951":"The food is delicious. Pork belly and the wedge was my favorite. Friends loved everything else from a beet salad to scallops. Everything is large portion meant to be kind of like tapas, but bigger.","3952":"Highly recommend!! Delicious food and very knowledgable waiters. The Brussels sprouts are to die for! I haven't tried anything I don't like from the Lark. The popcorn they bring to the table when you arrive is scrumptious-I wanted to take some home but unfortunately they don't sell it & they don't give it away. YOU NEED TO SELL THE POPCORN LARK! The ambiance is quite stunning-this is by far my favorite special occasion restaurant in SB! The only draw back was the hostess the last time I took a friend for her birthday. She was rude and acted as if she owned the place. Strange that they would have someone like that at the front greeting the guests. Everyone else was exceptional!!","3953":"One of the most interesting restaurants in the Santa Barbara area. The atmosphere inside this now elegant, but former fish market, is perfectly executed to give you a sense of quiet quality, yet preserving the interest and history of the building. \n\nIt would be difficult to suggest a perfect entree at The Lark as they are all excellent. The professional level of service we receive as guests of this restaurant, along with the wonderful food, just makes this spot a little treasure among the many great restaurants in town. \n\nIt's a unique place for a special occasion and the food is not going to disappoint even the most finicky of guests. The wine list and drinks prepared by the bar are as well thought out and prepared as is the fine dining experience. The restaurant is very popular with locals and always seems to be busy.  Reservations will help you avoid a wait for seating.","3954":"We fully intended on ordering forty five items, our server walked us through what was an appropriate amount and his thoughts on timing. The items we listed we told him in no particular order and they were coursed appropriately and timed just perfectly. \nOur server gave stellar drink recommendations. I'll say our main draw was the vibe. It was a great scene and fun bar, cute tables and booth combinations- want to go back and visit the bar by the rest room -not sure what that was but seemed cute","3955":"Dinner ,  Nov 11.\nThe Good: \nBrussel Sprouts xlnt and I dislike the ordinary one's\nSouthern Pimento Cheese.Wife from New Orleans and she enjoyed.. A  LOT\nThe really good: \nDessert -Deep Fried Autumn Spice Cake =YUM\nThe Great:\nLamb Shank.. to die for , unbelievable  \nThe Avg: \nServer advice was a bit off...the table \"Family style of 2-3 items per person was TOO MUCH food ..our meal was overfull with only 3 for the 2 of us \nso beware\nwill dine here again..not cheap but worth it","3956":"Very nice bold flavors that blend quite well. Dessert was so-so. In a great walking area in SB. Lots of parking.","3957":"This is one of those places where the look is casual and relaxed, and the vibe buzzy, but the food and service are at the highest professional level, and innovation suffuses the menu.  Dishes are served \"family style,\" meaning to be shared.  You order everything at once and the chef decides in what order to bring it out.  This very creative chef loves fruit with savory dishes, and he loves colors.  If you think this sounds weird, it's not - everything works, and it's all delicious. Our favorite dish was a mix of stone fruit (peaches, nectarines, apricots) tossed with a lime dressing with burrata (soft mozzarella) cheese on a bed of cashew paste and topped with a tangle of mustard greens. \n\nThe place is very popular, and deservedly so. Reservations on weekend nights are a must.","3958":"We went here for my birthday, September 29, on the suggestion of a family member. We didn't know how it worked with ordering, so we were guided to choose a couple of things to share, given that the portions are large. We started off with some amazing Brussels sprouts, then had a zucchini plate that was a pretty as it was delicious. Our entree was the scallops - not generally my favorite, but these were very good. Because it was my birthday, we were given a dessert, which was also divine. We were \"Thanksgiving full,\" at conclusion, and very impressed. It is quite pricy, but if you share food between people at the table you can come away with a little over $100 for two , including drinks. How another reviewer spent twice that, I'm not sure - maybe not sharing plates. It's our new \"special occasion\" place.","3959":"We had an excellent experience at The Lark. The food is locally sourced, creative and delicious! The service is comfortable and unobtrusive. It's truly one of the gems in the FunkTown area of Santa Barbara.","3960":"Short and sweet. Service, drinks and ambiance was exceptional. Ordered three meals:\n\n-Brussels sprouts: I liked them but husband thought they were over spiced where you could not even taste the vegetable.\n-Heirloom Tomato Panzanella: fantastic. Just amazing.\n-Roasted Beets & Strozzapreti Pasta: did not like it at all. The chef went crazy with too many flavors and spices that did not work together. We never send anything back but had to send this one back.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit.","3961":"Recently went there for a birthday party and was not impressed. I ordered the Pastrami Encrusted New York and it had to have been the worst cut of meat I have had in over 5 years. The service was ok, but they definitely try to up sell you on ordering more items. The only reason I give it 2 stars is primarily for the Roasted Beet Salad being good.","3962":"I know its trendy but it also happens to score on all fronts.\n\nServers have a passion for the food and they will take time to tell you about it. I had the cheese plate which was prepared with love and a dessert wine flight which made the grade. The Mr. came for dessert and it was a decadent threesome of chocolate.\n\nI haven't had an entree yet but given the service and the platters that I saw come out of the windowed kitchen, I cannot wait for my next trip to SB just to head to The Lark.","3963":"This meal is one of the top 10 meals I have ever had! Brussel sprouts ( yes brussel sprouts) were amazing, perfection ! My husband had the hangar steak , which IMO is a must ! I wish he had shared more lol my son and I shared the trout which was cooked perfectly but hmmmmmm that hangar steak! Service was prompt, ambiance on point and my 20 month old behaved well lol, it was a fantastic dinner.","3964":"This place was touted as the hot new restaurant in town with the fancy SF chefs, and while it was definitely a step up from many a Santa Barbara restaurant, it can't hold a candle to any of the SF joints that we regularly frequent. And I'm not talking fancy SF joints, just the good old regular ones. \n\nPart of it might have been the timing. We went for New Years, and the dinner was wildly expensive and wildly massive. It was a fixed course meal (ok, it's new years, whatever) but it was literally like eating 5 courses. They didn't shrink the portion sizes and there was just so much food. It was all good, but nothing really stood out as amazing. And when they're charing you $125 a person + a mandatory 25% tip (wtf btw??) I'm going to expect a lot more. \n\nI'm hoping this was the whole \"new restaurant still trying to figure crap out\" but I'm probably going to wait a while before I return. Or at least go on a regular night where i can order one meal and not 5.","3965":"The Lark is a unique find with a fun atmosphere and excellent food. All dishes are intended to be served family-style for the table, which adds to the fun and conversation deciding what to order and who gets the last bite. \n\nThe fun atmosphere creates a lot of noise - ask for a booth when you make a reservation if you want a little more privacy and quiet, or dine in their large outdoor area, which is a little quieter. \n\nOur server was very helpful and attentive. You should ask the server for recommendations regarding the size of different dishes to help order the right amount of food. And save room for dessert. They were fantastic as well. \n\nGood wine selection, but the wines were overpriced in my opinion. They have a full bar and a few unique cocktails, but we didn't try any of these. \n\nThe noise and price are the only things that kept me from giving this 5 stars.","3966":"It is a rare thing to experience such incredible service, it is the primary driver of a lasting impression that must be shared. But if your question is, how is the food, or ambiance then I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. The setting is that of a casually romantic garden, with the high-end rustic touches that feel very \"Santa Barbara\" in all the right ways. The menu is an elegant and adventurous take on New American. Even trendy classic dishes such as the Deviled Eggs starter were uniquely exceptional. For example the stunning presentation of 3 eggs, neatly situated on a petit plate, contrasted with the decadence of a creamy overstuffed filling, sprinkled with bits of jalepeno, dashed in an abundant burst of colorful paprika, and topped with a delicate twist of bacon. \n\nWe also had the opportunity to try the oysters, ratatouille, and goat cheese olives, which were all lovely and beautifully presented, but the stand out foodie-to-foodie-you-must items were the homemade pimento cheese starter, the duck mouse dish, and the marshmallow pot de creme dessert. \n\nLastly, back to the service - we made this reservation on a whim last minute through Open Table, mentioning that it was our anniversary - hoping for a table on the patio. When we arrived they had already set a table for us with a personalized 'Happy Anniversary' card in a private little nook of the patio. They brought us complementary prosecco, and both our server and a manager were perfectly helpful, attentive, pleasant, and generous - offering that amazing duck mousse for us to try on the house when we were on the fence about it. There is something so admirable about a place with the guts and skill to experiment with the menu, but also the down-to-earth enthusiasm about their food, such that at the end of the day, they just want you to try it. Five well-deserved stars!","3967":"Came here for dinner on NY Eve and had a fine dinner.\n\nA unique dining experience and a much needed venue for Santa Barbara.\n\nThere is a party like wine bar next door so you can take the night to the next level if you wish.\n\nService was attentive and the food quality and portions were very satisfactory. Lots of nice beers on tap in addition to a good wine list.","3968":"Amazing food. Excellent service.  Great atmosphere. I am in love with this place! Our faves: scallops, oysters, half chicken with the best polenta I have ever had in my life, and panzanella salad. Yum!","3969":"This is one the best restaurants I've been to in a long time here in Santa Barbara the food is all from local farmers here and made to perfection very flavorful with every bite yuh take. I had shrimp and grits which was amazing, then we had the porceta, artichoke with eggs and two amazing desserts one pineapple upside down cake and one chocolate cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The service was terrific and I was in unpretentious atmosphere considering the food very well priced I would've paid double that for the meal.  It was soooo good.","3970":"After hearing great things about this place for quite a while my wife and I were eager to try it. We were VERY disappointed! At every level this was a terrible experience. The waiter was rude and slow (kept calling me \"Boss\"). But the food was the most disappointing part. We started with the brussels sprouts, which were ok, but not worthy of the reviews we'd heard. We then moved on the the yellow tail, which was a mess of mixed flavors that didn't blend well and were completely over powered by citrus, the fish itself was flavorless. We then had the beef cheeks, this was the low point in the meal. Beef cheeks should be tender and almost pillowy. These were a stringy over cooked mess. After one bite my wife wouldn't even eat them. The ambience is quite nice, and maybe worth stopping by for a drink, but I will not be returning to eat there.","3971":"I had a great easy-going dinner here with my husband and son.\nBrought a bottle of our own wine -corkage fee is $25.  Sat at a table at 6pm, right off- with our reservation, \nThe  popcorn they put on the table is just fabulous.\nService was good and friendly. \nI do think going early here is probably best if you like it quieter since it does get quite crowded later. \nWe loved everything we got some things a bit more than than others.  \nWe first got Yellowtail Hamachi Crudo with compressed watermelon, shishito peppers, olive oil aioli, early summer gazpacho, candied coriander seed, lemon basil.  It wasn't quite enough  to split with three people but we got a delicious taste! I 'd  order two orders of that next time for 3 of us. \nWe had  Garden Of' Salanova Lettuces- with \nfromage blanc, poppyseed, marinated nectarines, wildflower honey, marcona almonds, opal basil. I loved it but my son does not like fruit in salad so much-- if you don't like that this would be not for you. \nThen we all loved   Grilled Japanese Eggplant - cilantro yogurt, blistered shishito peppers, sweet & sour pickles, duck fat breadcrumbs, mizuna. \nExcellent- I get that again. \n My husband decided he wanted little bread and ordered the Southern Pimento Cheese Toast.. He liked it but personally I thought it was too heavy. \n And oh my this pasta dish was fabulous though - though I think a little pricey at $34  for the size. But It was enough for three of us with everything else we had though and it was scrumptious . Not too heavy. Hand Cut Pappardelle-- english peas, hen of the wood mushrooms, sugar snap peas, piedmont white truffle, pine nuts, parmesan. Yum. \nWe ended with the octopus which we thought tasted great but we all agreed it had too much grains underneath -would've preferred it just with the asparagus. We will try the chicken next  time or the scallops. They didn't have a flat iron steak this time and that might be something to come back for.  Overall great dinner. And want to try different things next time!","3972":"The Lark is an establishment where people can feel casual and eat fancy. With monthly menu changes, the food stays fresh, interesting, and fun. It is continuously changing and striving for uniqueness. I've had duck liver mousse, squid ink pasta, hamachi crudo, crab risotto, pork belly, and much more. Each with their own style, aesthetic, and flair. Edible flowers, fresh organic greens, fruits, and a myriad of plating styles add to the excitement of trying a new dish.\nI feel like I've grown with The Lark. From trying it for the first time in undergrad and spending money like it was our parents' (because it was), to celebrating my birthday and job offers, to random weeknight cravings for brussels and a good cocktail. I'm never disappointed in the service or the quality of the food and the drinks. Will be a forever customer and hype woman for the Lark.","3973":"The ambience is great.  Eat outside; too loud inside to have a conversation.  Menu is meant to be shared.  We ordered crispy brussell sprouts & deviled eggs to start.  Brussels were roasted and lovely.  Even folks who don't like them in general like them.  The eggs were ok, but just ok.  We ordered roasted beets, the wedge and roasted carrots from the \"salad\"\/farm section.  All were stellar.  For our mains we had crispy lamb and pappardelle and the hanger steak.  Steak was awesome.  The lamb I felt was more over done than crispy but the noodles were yummy.  Service was stellar.  My only complaint was the timing of the dishes; one second your table is jammed but then we only had the carrots... Learn to pace things in a logical way.  Two thumbs up for free valet parking. Oh!  The complimentary profiteroles with blueberry compote for my honey's birthday were exceptionally yummy.","3974":"Came here on a date while on vacation in Santa Barbara. We sat in one of the two \"confessional\" tables - adorable! Cute and intimate restaurant. \n\nWe ordered the asparagus, redfish, and steak to share. Everything was absolutely delicious! We simply couldn't finish at the end. I think my favorite was the steak. \n\nFor drinks, I had the Industry Sour and he had the Old Aztec, essentially an old fashioned. Both were wonderful. \n\nI highly recommend.","3975":"The Lark is really great and probably my favorite place to take out-of-town guests in Santa Barbara. They are always changing up  their menu which is fun for locals as well. Their brussel sprouts are a must-order. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of their dishes are so flavorful with fun spices that it's a bit hard to actually taste the meats & veggies. But the service here is great and it's always fun to go to the Lark! Tip: if you're on a date, beware of the popcorn appetizer as it can get stuck in your teeth the rest of the night! Pack some floss if you have to have it!","3976":"If you are looking for an outstanding dining experience The Lark is it.  My daughter and I were so happy we made a reservation at this new restaurant in Santa Barbara and that we had an excellent experience.  It was obvious to us that the owners\/chef attention to detail and the training of the waitstaff  was not overlooked, but that lots of time was invested in making sure the customers experience would be the best any restaurant could offer.\n\nThey were all professional, friendly, and knowledgable.  I also appreciated the valet parking. \n\nThe food was simply delicious, fresh, and interesting and we will definitely return soon.","3977":"Loved everything about The Lark: the atmosphere, the food, the service and the wine. We sat at the bar which was perfect. You must order the Brussel sprouts. And the hangar steak was phenomenal. The perfect size. I'd pass on the pot de creme to save calories and would use them on the wine instead.","3978":"Good service and food portions. The salads and apps were good, not great. The scallops were over cooked and below average. I would not go back.","3979":"Went to the Lark because we heard it was one of the best spots in town to eat.  Upon arrival, instead of greeting us, the hostess asked if we had a reservation.  We did not, and they had to \"SEARCH\" for a table for us.  Finally, another hostess said she could squeeze us in but that we had to make sure we were done with our meal by 8:00 pm due to an existing reservation for another group.  Mind you, we arrived at 6:00 on a Thursday night and looking around there were few occupied tables.  We sat down anyways and proceeded with dinner.  Our waitress though was very friendly and made up for the ridiculous greeting we received.  She was kind enough to offer suggestions and work around our dietary needs.  We had a pleasant meal out on the pretty, well manicured patio.  We left at approximately 8:15 and saw multiple open tables.  We definitely did not need to be told that we needed to leave.\n\nWe were thinking of coming back for a big family dinner event since it is a \"family style\" restaurant and it's in a cute part of town.  However, trying to make reservations here for a large party has been a nightmare.  You're supposed to use the \"contact us\" feature on their website where you leave details of what you're looking for.  You receive a standard email explain fees and scheduling, but to talk to someone in person took 3 days after leaving a message for the contact person.  After speaking to that person, we agreed that I didn't need to reserve the large room but rather reserve just a large table.  Unfortunately, she's not the person who handles that and passed me on to someone else.  That person did leave me a message in a timely fashion, unfortunately I wasn't able to answer immediately.  Since that, it has been about a week and a half and 4 messages left for this person who seems to never be there at the restaurant.  Every time you call the number they leave, this person has conveniently just \"left for the day\" despite trying to call at different times on different days.  \n\nIf it takes this long to just speak to someone to coordinate the possibility of reserving a table, I can't imagine how much more difficult it will be after that in planning menus.  I will not return to this establishment due purely to their service.  It's almost as if your business means nothing to them because they'll always have someone else wanting to be there.  I just think back to when we first tried this place and were told we needed to leave at a certain time to make room for others.  No passion for customer service.","3980":"Superb meal! Creative menu perfectly executed. Staff and service were excellent. One of the best meals we've had in ages. Highest possible recommendation. Enjoy!","3981":"This place is so packed that it ruins the experience, and it creates a high stress environment instead of a relaxing one.  Maybe we will try again on a very slow night.","3982":"I was told that this was the bestia of Santa Barbara. They were close but they weren't right. \n\nThe service and food was good. \n\nI loved the space and the overall vibe. Loved our server and just the ambiance. \n\nWill be back for sure!","3983":"We don't get it.  The place is noisy and crowded.  The service is rushed and uncoordinated.  For example, our second course arrived before we finished our first course.  And, each platter of food was served with so many vegetables, you could barely find what you thought you had ordered.  We could hardly find the hangar steak underneath the pile of broccoli it was buried underneath.  And the trout, while good, came with enough cauliflower to serve a family of six.   If you enjoy what look like huge servings (mostly vegetables) of  overly seasoned food, perhaps you'll go for this place.  But, if you want imaginative cuisine in a more refined setting, I suggest you stay away.","3984":"Based upon the copious 4 and 5 star reviews I was looking forward to dinner here.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) I was able to secure first seating reservations on New Years Eve.  They didn't offer their regular menu rather it was a interesting five course tasting menu of sorts with an optional paired wine.  There were some regular dishes in addition to some other newer creations.\n\nCitus cured salmon with creme fraiche was excellent but the almost every piece of the brioche was burned.  We ordered more but same thing again...burned.\n\nBranzino also was overcooked with the skin burnt.\n\nDuck liver mousse was overtly sweet that evening.  \n\nCrab salad was bland.  \n\nChicken was cooked to perfection with beautiful crispy golden skin and wonderfully tasty.  (As good as Zuni Cafe in SF...in fact tastes like it was from Zuni!)\n\nDesserts were average.  \n\nService was an A for effort but still needs some polishing. \n\nAmbience was great.\n\nI would not normally comment on these last items but a customer is entitled to greater expectations when you pay a couple hundred dollars per adult.  \n\nIn general it is difficult to comment on the food because of the technical issues I described.  It is a nice but young restaurant that hopefully will continue to go with what works while it works on its consistency.","3985":"Simply one of the best restaurants I've been to in Southern California. Make sure to have reservations because they are packed as soon as they open. \nWe tried several dishes and they were all excellent. Prepared perfectly using the highest quality ingredients. \nEverything is meant to share and I would think the more people you have at your table the more fun it would be to eat there.","3986":"The food has unfortunately disappointed us the past two visits. It is not outstanding but the ambience and vibe is. We had the gnocchi which was flavorful but way overlooked. The charcuterie was semi-special, lots of fatty raw meats but a pork shank in a jar stood out. Hit 'n miss I suppose. Go for the scene and fun which is probably the best in town.","3987":"I would only recommend this place for a place to be \"seen\" while having a cocktail. The food was pretty terrible. We started with a half cheese and meat boards. The blue cheese was fine, but the aged gouda was impossible to cut with the butter knives on the table. We were not giving a proper utensil for going into battle with this rock-hard cheese. The only way to really eat it was to gnaw on it like those giant Hershey kisses you get when you're a kid on Valentine's Day. We then had the wedge salad which was really wedges of weeds with a creamy dressing. The flavor of the dressing wasn't bad, but don't false advertise your weed salad. Moving on, we had the half chicken. The flavor of the chicken was good, the mashed potatoes were good, but where were the vegetables? Again, weeds. There were weeds on top and about 5 snap peas. Not really enough for the \"family style\" platters this place likes to do. The only reason I give two stars is for the cheesecake dessert. That was pretty sweet. I might just go for a night cap and dessert if I were ever to return, but that's highly unlikely.  If you're a foodie, go to Bouchan on Victoria street. That place is on point.","3988":"This place is just awesome. The food is delicious, service is great and the decor is lovely! The Lark is such a unique restaurant in town! Try the brussels sprout, the bone marrow and the wine is delicious too. Can get a little pricey but I thought the value was really good. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara!","3989":"Ambiance was 5 stars.\n\nFood was OK, not out of the world but decent, would go back for the good vibes!\n\nNot a lot of vegetarian options (if any, my date had to ask)","3990":"The location and ambience is nice.\nThe service was terrific.\nThe food was less than great.\nWonderful family style approach.\n\nInstead of bread, they served popcorn which is trendy and nice. The popcorn was, however, a warning for the rest of the meal. The popcorn was seasoned with 1) grapefruit zest 2) mint 3) basil 4) habenero oil 5) ?. It was TOO much. Layering is important but once you've moved beyond 2-3 flavors its just too much.\n\nWe ordered the fried olives and the warm olives. The warm olives were just fine, standard fare. The fried olives, again, too many different flavors and when combined with the fried covering, it was heavy.\n\nNext was the Wedge salad. Great bacon, great dressing, the bbq's fennel-again too much, spicy cashews-just stop. When food is fresh and tasty, you want to taste it, not confuse it with 5 other things.\n\nGnocci was a cheese gnocchi in a lamb curry ragu. Again, the gnocchi alone would have been so tasty in a light sauce or the ragu by itself.\n\nThe white fish was cooked so well, crispy skin, great flavors but the rest of the plate was a hot mess.\n\nI wanted to love this place, but we were so maxed out on fighting flavors that dessert was a big no.\n\nPare down the ingredients and show off the local freshness and you have a winner","3991":"Great find via yelp while spending the weekend in Santa Barbara. Located in the very cool FUNK zone, this place has a great menu. Craft cocktails, beer and wine. Deviled eggs are a great starter.","3992":"What a fabulous experience from top to bottom!  Fantastic service from a very interested and engaging staff.  Nice wine list.  The food was creative, visually stunning, and absolutely delicious.  While some people would consider this a splurge, the value is excellent.  I would dine here every time I visit Santa Barbara!","3993":"Loved our server Vanessa she was great. Brussels sprouts were perfectionist. It's really a 4.5 octopus was perfectly cooked as were the shrimp. Dessert menu looks amazing and would be great place to be a regular.","3994":"Excellent service and excellent food!  We ordered the brussel sprouts, pork belly and red snapper and were extremely satisfied.  The beef cheeks were good too but have had better and probably wouldn't order it again.  \n\nThis is a great date night spot or for an evening out with friends.   Can't wait to come back and try all the other menu items!","3995":"4.5 stars . Fine cuisine. Not many options for vegetarian\/ vegan but they have a wide range selection and everything I ordered tasted good. Their dishes are unique. The Russel spouts were my favorite and it was priced really well","3996":"Fabulous restaurant - we were celebrating a special anniversary and they couldn't have been nicer, plus we sat outside with our dogs. The food is innovative but still delicious (loved the Seabass) and the wine list offers something for everyone. 5 stars. We can't wait to return.","3997":"My wife and I were in SB on a Sunday night because I had work there in the morning.  We always try to get off the beaten path, avoid the tourist madhouse that is State Street.  This restaurant was not far from our hotel and was in an area called the Funk Zone - obviously, very artsy, hipster area made of lots of repurposed warehouses, filled with guys sporting long waxed mustaches and girls with 2K+ Instagram followers.  We arrived around 730pm on a Sunday night and were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but we could sit at the \"community table.\"  Should have been called the \"Ignore Your Neighbor Table\" - my wife and I love to reach out and tried to engage some of the waxed mustachioed guys in conversation - not happening.  Oh well, onto the food and drink - it did not start off well.  My wife ordered a cabernet by the glass  - the waitress said they were out.  My wife and I said we were thinking about ordering the Lark Burger off the bar menu, the waitress again said \"we only have one left\" ??  How do you run out of burger patties???  But we persevered because we were capital H HUNGRY and we ordered the Grilled Atlantic Sapphire Salmon and the Cast Iron Roasted Chicken, with a some whiskey neat for me and an ..available.. Cabernet for Sweetie.\n\nHow was it you ask? Well, do you remember when \"Newlyweds:Nick and Jessica\" was on MTV and Jessica said \"Is this chicken I have or is it fish? I know it's tuna, but it says chicken...\"?  That was what it was like, but not in a bad way.  I had the Salmon which was so good that each bite you can't help but stop and say \"YUM!.\"  And my wife had the Chicken which was a crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, roasted chicken, quartered and served in a skillet with a plethora of amazing vegetables and kale.  Again, super yummy!  But in both dishes, there were mysterious food items, where we couldn't help but say \"What is this I have?  Is it a mushroom? A Parsnip?\"  Mind you, every bit of it was so flavorful and good, but we truly had no idea what some of it was !! \n\nWe would probably not go back - the food was so, SO good, definitely 5\/5.  The communal table was awkward and no fun - 2\/5.  And the server, although not terrible, was not overly attentive and certainly not helpful. She initially recommended that we order an appetizer, a salad and 2-3 entrees for the two of us, because it was a sharing style menu.  Yet, everyone we saw around us who ordered like that, either threw most of the food away or lost their steam around midway through the 3rd course and left with a stack of ToGo boxes.  We were completely satiated with our two entrees.  So service is 3\/5.  Overall, it was a good, not great experience, so 3 stars.","3998":"Love this place in the funk zone. All the food is outstanding and the service is top notch. Love the romantic setting too. Cool patio as well. Will definitely be back!","3999":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars! We ate here last Saturday night and what a wonderful experience. The waitstaff was friendly, informative and always available. The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The was one of the best meals I have ever had! If you are in or near Santa Barbara, do yourself a favor and go to this place -you will be very happy you did.","4000":"Usually we limit our dollar sign search to two, but we heard so many great things about this place, we just had to try it.  Originally we were quoted a 2 hour wait time, it turned out we only had to wait about 45 minutes... and those 45 minutes were worth it. \n\nOur server Lauren was down to earth and just the right amount of attentive.  Let's not forget her suggestions, geuine and spot on.  I didn't feel like she was trying to give us a sales pitch, everything she recommended was outrageously delicious.\n\nThe wine, lovely. My fiance had the scotch cocktail which he ended up not being into because it was too sweet for his liking, Lauren brought him the old aztec instead which he was fond of.\n\nWe had the following\nDeviled eggs--- yowza, delicious.\nRoot veggie chips -- crisp and salted to perfection, I just would reccomend a few more of those chips to keep up with the hefty portion lovely goat cheese dip.\nBrussels-- we were going to hold the dates but thankfully Lauren recommended to keep them in this dish... incredible plate, well thought out.\nHanger steak dish--- WOW, just WOW, the meat was cooked to perfection, at medium rare it practically melted in my mouth \n...and then best of Marscapone, talk about melted in your mouth! The blueberries were a delightful touch.\n\nAtmosphere--- Some tables can be pretty close, but that's expected in a place this hip.\nService--- Lauren was wonderful and everyone clearing plates and running food, also friendly and right on cue.  Adrian may as well have been an octopus because he was speedy and extremely effective at keeping our water full and our table clear.\nFood--- I want to hug the culinary genius behind this menu, chef... you go, you do your beautiful artistic thing!\n\nYes, the price is up there, but honestly, so much more than worth it.\n\nOnly thing I would change, would love to see some Ninkasi Brewing on draft :)","4001":"Celebrated a 1 year anniversary here! Words cannot explain. It was incredible. They started us off with champagne  and a very nice happy anniversary note. Christina was an amazing waitress!! We had the Brussels sprouts and beet and burrato salad. Which were perfect. Ended with the rib eye which was perfectly cooked! Huge portions! Unreal taste! Amazing service! Can't wait to come back!","4002":"Honestly this is my first yelp review. I've worked in hospitality for the last 10 years, and I'm uber critical when I go to dinner. Hands down this was one if the best dining experiences I've had. From the service, to the wine, to the food, it was all phenomenal! You'd be making a mistake if traveling to Santa Barbara and passing on The Lark!","4003":"This is the good stuff right here. Great food, even better ambiance. Don't plan to rush your meal - take your time and enjoy the experience.","4004":"Creative delicious food and the best service! Love this place! it was our second visit and was just as good as the first.","4005":"Brilliantly fun, hip with a beautiful crowd and good food to boot. The patio is killer and place I will enjoy spending Santa Barbara \"winter\" nights and beyond.\n\nBeat salad- large and delicious. Well worth it\nDeviled eggs- 3 that you will fight over. The hint of bacon is killer\nBone marrow on buttermilk biscuits- light and fluffy with a rich kick. Love in your mouth. Eat up!\nWhole branzino- the least exciting of the night. Not a whole fish but a filet with a tail. The grill flavor is the best here and the kale is a massive filler. Compared to the rest, I'll pass on this this.\n\nThe timing of the dishes was poor. Our small table for two was filled with a filter water, jug that was rarely touched by the staff, side pates, wine and cocktails glasses and a cup of pop corn. Please stop bring out food. It's getting cold. No really. Every waiter who approached the table seemed to know the menu like they were assigned a section, less one who read off the menu and basically said everything was great. Slow down and let me enjoy the evening. That's the only negative here but not enough to bring me back...this time.\n\nThe dress is causal hip with many men in jeans & jackets and women in heels but it's Santa Barbara, come as you are. The bar is small and packed with all eaters. I did not see the causal drinker. You're here to chow down. No music to speak of and the lighting is mellow. A date night in the corner, friends out at a big top or Wednesday, it's all here. You can be too. Make a reservation through Open Table and the night is yours. \n\nThe Lark is a place to share whether it's with friends in your group or people you just met at large table. If you don't have a relaxed, casual evening meeting new people or getting to know yours better, it's your fault. The Lark begs for conversation. I met a few lovely people and ran into a friend. Maybe I'll see you there too. You'll spend $80 for two with a couple of drinks so it's very reasonable. The wine list can set you back another $80 on average or MUCH more. All in good time.\n\nThis is Santa Barbara's next, best thing. Let's hope it sticks around.","4006":"The food and the service continue to exceed our expectations. The brussels sprouts and little gems wedge salad are favorites and the latest pork chop creation was perfectly cooked and delicious. Desert offerings never fail to please. Try the espresso ice cream sandwich...it was divine.","4007":"Had dinner here last week.  Our waiter was very nice .  We loved the popcorn, hamachi appetizer, and Brussels sprouts.  The drinks were tasty and creative as well.  Went a bit downhill from there.  We waited a really long time for our entree which was the wagyu steak. The waiter came and apologized for the long wait.  When we finally got it, the plate and vegetables were very hot, but the meat actually cold and tough.  Felt like the items were reheated in a microwave and then the cold steak put on top.  Not acceptable for a 44 dollar dish.  Our waiter sent over a manager and she did take it off the bill.  We had waited so long and didn't want to wait for a replacement meal .  Quite a bummer.","4008":"Loved the Brussels sprouts, the duck liver,  hanger steak, and Honey Cremeux. Was a great experience coming here.  The staff was fabulous and even offered blankets while we enjoyed the outdoor patio.","4009":"My family made a reservation at The Lark for 14 people to celebrate my graduation from UCSB. The whole process was thoughtful and enjoyable, from the emails exchanged between the planner and my mom (discussing menus and portions) to the 5-star table service we received. Our waitress was on top of everyone's dietary restrictions (dairy, spices, tree nuts, and poultry - we're a fun bunch, I know), and the chef had no problem accommodating these restrictions. The atmosphere is always so lovely, and of course, the food is artisan quality and beautifully prepared. However, what I want to focus on in this review is how impressed we were with the service we received and how special it was to have such a nice celebration the night of my graduation. I will miss The Lark and Lucky Penny and will go out of my way to stop by when visiting Santa Barbara.","4010":"Great service and good food. Skip the duck pate a la peanut butter jelly. The drinks were awesome!","4011":"Atmosphere is amazing but personally I think the food was hyped up more than it's actually worth. Brussels sprouts and cornbread absolutely amazing. The flat ironed steak was too chewy for my taste. Also ordered the ribs which were good but the potatoes had a strange taste, was not a fan. If I'm the area I would try it again and choose different entree's.","4012":"We loved our experience at this restaurant!\nThe food was excellent , the atmosphere was great, and the staff were fantastic. It was a great birthday weekend !","4013":"Came here after a wine tasting down the street. My husband and I enjoyed a series of dishes, from brussels sprouts (SO delicious -- citrusy, crispy, rustic), burrata and peaches (if you don't like burrata, you should just stop reading now), and then the tabouleh platter, which was outstanding. Definitely not inexpensive, but that's to be expected for Santa Barbara. Amazing service, enthusiastic recommendations. Would definitely visit again.","4014":"My chief complaint about The Lark, which in and of itself is nothing short of lovely, is that the Chef needs to edit.  The menu is perfectly crafted with  broad appeal, farm-to-table but finds itself always one-ingredient too much.  The duck fat does little to enhance the fingerling potatos.  The beet and buratta salad is confused by plumots (sort of a plum, sort of an appricot).   The brussel sprouts are lost in, and not enhanced by the fish sauce.  Certainly this is an elevated menu, but it need not be quite so superfluous to be effective.\n\nThe aesthetic in the restaurant is deconstructed, linear and fresh.  While not at all kid friendly, I was impressed by the number of well behaved children on a week night and was further impressed by the servers gracious accommodations of the children seated near us (buttered noodles with cheese, pizza from Lucky Penny)\n\nThe hand-crafted cocktails are spectacular as are the deserts.\n\nServers are friendly and attentive, if struggling perhaps to find that balance between the laid-back vibe in Santa Barbara and the seen-be-seen restaurants in LA:  Yes, I want to hear about the menu. No, I do not want an interpretive dance.\n\nDinner for 4 with cocktails and desert ran $200 for 4 (pre tip)- perfectly on-par with other restaurants in Santa Barbara.\n\nCall for reservation to ensure outdoor seating if that's a priority for your group.  \n\nWonderful for a date- many plates are share plates which might be off putting for some first dates and equally disarming for business lunches.  Particularly if it's a table of men... I don't make the rules, but I don't see 4 men sharing the pimiento cheese on toast.","4015":"This place is costy, but it is well worth it. Great food and service.","4016":"Fantastic! We are only visiting Santa Barbara for a week and have to go there twice. Exceptional, fresh and unique dishes. We loved the cauliflower and couscous, the duck and delicious Brussel sprouts.","4017":"Went for dinner last night, oysters were great and the scallops were absolutely amazing. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Add a great beer selection and this place is a winner.","4018":"I have been here a few times and we are quite impressed with their seasonal menu. Everything from the apps, entrees and cocktails have all been amazing and fresh, and the service is quite spectacular.","4019":"I just had a fantastic dinner at the Lark.  We sat at the bar and had incredible service by Ariel.  Every one of her suggestions was better than expected.  The southern pimento cheese appetizer with grilled bread was so delicious.  Everyone raved about the brussel sprouts, so we ordered these and they are THE BEST ever - the combination with the dates and the lime is over the top!  The smoked pork belly with the almond brittle and summer pepper is so delicious.  My husband loved his hanger steak... it melted in your mouth.  This place is a must if you are in the area. YUM!","4020":"I had an awesome anniversary dinner here. I loved everything we got but the true winner was the Bone Marrow Crusted Beef Cheeks. The ambiance is perfect and they sat us in an old confessional, very interesting.","4021":"Went to The Lark last weekend for an anniversary dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. Requested outside seating and was so glad I did -the inside was crowded and seemed a little too noisy for any real conversation. Was seated at an intimate table for two in the corner right next to a cozy fire pit. Only annoying thing was that the table wasn't cleared off before we were seated and we had to wait by it while a server cleared off the dirty glasses and napkins. \n\nStarted off with the amazing popcorn and my guy's eyes lit up when he realized that was the starter instead of typical bread. We went with the half cheese plate as our first course which was great, except the waitress brought it to us minus one of the cheeses. She quickly realized and remedied but it was still a bit annoying to be brought an unfinished plate. We were then brought the famous brussels sprouts which were pretty great, though a little too inundated with the sauce for my taste. Next was the risotto with goat cheese platter followed by the steak platter, and the steak was truly the star of the night. I can't remember the last time I had such a perfectly cooked and flavorful cut. The steak was a little slow to come out after the risotto, but the quality was worth the wait.\n\nEnded the evening with the chocolate hazelnut ice cream sandwich, which hit the perfect notes of sweet and savory with the grilled peaches. There were plenty of dishes I still want to try, which gives us the perfect excuse to come back next time we're in Santa Barbara!","4022":"We were visiting from OC for the first time. \nThe atmosphere was great!  It was romantic, beautiful, and trendy! \nWe had to wait for almost 2 hours to get in. But it was worth it. Make a reservation in advance.Their food were very creative and delicious!! \nYou have to pomegranate glazed pork chops was my favorite.\nWe will definitely come back here again!","4023":"Chef Jason and his amazing culinary and service team did it again tonight with another WOW experience for our friends and us. Our third time here and we can't wait to come back!","4024":"We tried a lot of places while visiting here but this was, by far, our favorite. Went here twice! Unbelievable service from our adorable waiter, Mike! Worth the splurge!","4025":"Mm mmm! Fantastic food! Had a late reservation since that is the only one we could find. Started out with some exceptionally delicious spiced popcorn and cocktails. The meal that followed did not disappoint. The Brussels sprouts that I would have never thought to order are famous here and totally worth trying. They were crisp and flavorful. The cheeses on the cheese platter were well selected and came with some very good food pairings. The roast chicken and the scallops were tasty and cooked to perfection. I wish the serving sizes were not so huge. That would be fine if we had more people. They do say that they are a family style restaurant.overall highly recommended.","4026":"First time and I loved it and can't wait to go back! A friend and I went for dinner during the week and sat at the family style tall table near the bar. Love the laid back atmosphere but still great service and food! Our server was awesome and brought our drinks quickly and spaces our food perfectly! They start you off with this delicious popcorn with grapefruit zest, chili, and parsley, great cocktail choices, I got the mule and it was perfect. We shared the cauliflower gratin, duck liver mouse and the roast chicken, all delicious!","4027":"Best wedge salad I have ever had and I love wedge salads...haven't tried all that we have ordered but so far amazing!","4028":"My boyfriend and I had an AMAZING experience here for our one year anniversary!  This has become our go to tradition when visiting Santa Barbara due to the exceptional food, cocktails and service we had :)\n\nUpon walking in we received an endearing postcard with a special message to congratulate us for our first anniversary.  Throughout the night, everyone in the restaurant treated us with special treatment to help celebrate.  Easily one of the best meals we have ever had.  Super impressed and highly recommend.","4029":"Cool vibe, fun place for a cocktail, food hit and miss.  My husband and I had the Brussels sprouts = awesome!  pimiento cheese = good, scallops = good, duck mouse = very good, crab salad = bland, Sea Bass = 50\/50 I thought it was good, my husband not so much, chocolate s'more dessert = okay... We stayed four nights at the Bacara Resort and also dined at Los Agaves, The Fishhouse, Buchon and The Stonehouse (see our other reviews)","4030":"We sat at the communal table...arrive at 530pm and the place was packed by 630. That should tell you something! The food was excellent and the cocktails were delicious. I will be going back when i return to Santa Barbara!","4031":"What a treat! From the location, menu, drinks and an outstanding staff! Met Arri and Kyle (behind the bar) I enjoyed cocktails and the signature roasted chicken...and, yes, the Brussel sprouts...A must!\nMake sure to make a reservation, not needed, but, can make life a bit easier.","4032":"Just ate here with my husband. Great food and very good service. Loved all of the choices of food and beer and wine. Nice to sit and share a couple of different dishes. Will definitely return. Go Funk Zone","4033":"Friends recommended The Lark (count this review twice?) and they were correct. Charcuterie plate was wonderful. The head cheese was superb and the pickled veggies - perfect! The next dish was the beet salad - such beautiful presentation! We finished with the crab gnocchi. The spice overpowered the crab and the gnocchi were a little too fluffy for my taste (I prefer them toothsome and dense). Otherwise, they would have received five stars. The wine selection is compact and well selected. We chose the Tyler Pinot Noir and were pleased with the pick. The portions are large, and sharing is encouraged. We sat outside and the atmosphere was relaxing and intimate. Franz was our server, and he was delightful. We left very happy and would eat there again.","4034":"From the bacon cracked pepper and scallion popcorn that awaits you when you are seated all the way to dessert, everything was beautifully plated and delicious. The Lark has great ambiance and knowledgeable servers who were friendly and helpful. It was a great dining experience and I'm still daydreaming about the Rosemary Cornbread","4035":"Get reservations if you're planning on going for dinner Friday\/Saturday night! I made reservations and we still had to wait ~15 mins to be seated, but without reservations it would have been highly unlikely we would have gotten a table in less than 1 hr.\n\nThe plates at the Lark are designed to be shared and that's exactly what you want to do, because you're going to want to try a little of everything. We had 5 plates between 3 adults and I think that was just the right amount of food, although you may want to get a few smaller size plates if you want to save room for dessert. I highly recommend the foie gras and the scallops! The pimento cheese toast and triple creme brie were also delicious, and I would definitely get both again. The red leaf salad was good, but the dressing was sweet, making it taste like a dessert salad (if that exists). Given that a few of our other main dishes also had sweet components (triple creme brie, foie gras), we would have preferred our green salad to have the expected savory flavor.","4036":"Spendy, but a top tier gastro-experience in Santa Barbara. The funk zone is a very cool part of town. Chef Dan and his team are making some magic happen. It is the type of place you can come with a group of friends and share several dishes. It can be slammed on a Fri\/Sat night so be prepared. Awesome atmosphere and knowledgeable staff","4037":"I really enjoyed the food here. I thought it lived up to the reviews. Drinks were nice and strong. Food came out fairly quick. Waiter was attentive. We ordered the beat salad, steak, scallops, and half chicken. Maybe even over ordered for the three of us. Couldn't finish the chicken, but also thought it could be cooked just a little longer to make it fall off the bone good. Yum!","4038":"I heard a lot of good words of mouth. The place was busy and the servers courteous and a very cute place.\nAs to food: the presentation was beautiful on the dishes we had, however I really did not have anything that I thought it was out of this world or stay \"ummmm\" or maybe I'm just an hard ass and have had better. Well I have had better! We had Brussels sprouts which was like every other, beet salad, the asparagus, Pork, skirt steak (6 small slices in a large bed of nicely chard broccoli; lamb ribs were nicely cooked but it was fatty and on the cold side. The desert which was Chocolate Tres Leche cake which I found it tasteless and nothing to write home about. Overall we had a good time. It is nice and try it, you may like it more than I. Would I go back? Probably not but the next door Lucky Penny's pizza's looked good!","4039":"Fun place. Lots of energy. Creative menu of small, medium and large plates. Portions were very large--two of us shared the crispy Brussel sprouts, lamb tartare and hamachi collar and that was more than enough. All was delicious. Only criticism is that many of the dishes are sweet--they contain fruit or a marmalade or a pickled veggie. I tend to like more savory food and save sweets for dessert. But we enjoyed the food, cocktails and wine. Would recommend.","4040":"The Lark is fantastic. The food is so fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is very fun. We had Bill the waiter and he was great. We ordered everything he suggested and we were so happy we did. The best Brussels Sprouts on earth! \nI went last year and loved it and brought my husband and daughter this year. I already can't wait to go again.","4041":"This place is romantic, fun, and relaxing all at once! The food is excellent! The staff friendly and the wine is wonderful!","4042":"Good service. Hit or miss for me on the food. Fun drink menu. This place has been packed since the minute it opened. They're doing something right. I like sitting at the bar and having nibbles. Was not a huge fan when we came with friends and had a full in dinner. Addicted to the popcorn!","4043":"One of the best meals we have ever eaten. So good, don't bother with anywhere else in Santa Barbara. Or, em, maybe some other places were pretty darn wonderful too - but don't skip The Lark!\n\nTasty popcorn was set on the table and we knew we were off to a great start. The beer (sorry, I forget) and wine (a Malbec) were tasty and paired great with everything we ate.\n\nFirst we had the kale salad. I thought this would be \"yawn, another kale salad\" but I will eat those words. As long as they are covered in whatever dressing was on this salad. No joke. Get this salad.\n\nThen we had the pork belly. I mean, how can you go wrong with pork belly? The fattiness of the pork was perfectly complimented by the accompanied berries. Over a week later and we're still having dreams about this dish. It's haunting us.\n\nFinally, we had the half chicken. Which, was really good, just far too much food for two people. They were not serving the lamb dish that evening, otherwise we probably would have ordered that. The chicken was very good, just shadowed but the unexpected kale salad and exceptional pork belly.\n\nI can't imagine being in Santa Barbara and not eating here. Reservations seem helpful (maybe essential on weekend evenings). Great spot. Spent ~$80 for two and we had more than we could eat, it was worth every penny","4044":"We were most disappointed by the food. Atmosphere and server were nice. However, the food was terrible! Beautifully presented, but tasted terrible! We tried 4 items, and all 4 were disappointing (octopus - boring, mono flavor. Bone marrow - awful slimy meat with massive dry biscuit. Pork belly - grissle and fat with no meat. Deviled eggs - $7 for 2 eggs?!). The restaurant kindly comped 2 of the dishes due to issues, but it was very embarrassing for us to get into this situation in the first place...\n\nThe crowd felt very pretentious, with lots of posers.\n\nA great shame. We were really looking forward to our meal here.","4045":"Awful. Went just a week ago on Sunday and the oysters were so awful and fishy, I had to spit it out in my napkin. Seriously. I will never come back and the service was terrible. The waitress did not like that we had been enjoying the wineries around us and were happy tipsy. She mocked us (ladies- think Annie in bridewars when she mocks Helen \"ohhhh youuuu dooooo?\") how embarrassing for her because we all noticed and had to double check \"did she just-?\" \"Yep, I heard that\" Givin them one stars because other restaurants in this town deserve a visit over this place","4046":"Well I had a amazing meal and delicious drinks at The Lark, my bartender Arial was amazing!! So she steered us in the right direction after having a bad salad Bartlett Pear & Burrata. We got the Wedge- with thick chunks of crispy pork and then we got the smoked pork belly. We will be back, only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is the radicchio in the Bartlett Pear & Burratta.","4047":"I wish this restaurant was around while I attended UCSB (although I probably couldn't have afforded it at the time!) because the food is fantastic! Can't wait to drive up again for a weekend getaway to stop in and try more dishes at The Lark. We tried the pimento cheese on toast and the lamb shoulder confit. The pimento cheese on toast was good but didn't blow me away. The lamb shoulder confit was a different story--I could have eaten three plates of this stuff! Even my boyfriend agreed it was delicious and he usually dislikes lamb. Well not the case with this lamb, this lamb was the best! Also, wanted to mention the ambience is beautiful. Great for date night and also girl's night. Try it!","4048":"Deeeeelicious!! Great food, great atmosphere.. and their dessert chef, Jeff Haines, is AMAZING!!! We sat outside on their gorgeous patio. Located in the Funk Zone which has a fun, hip vibe!! Lots of fun places to go out to afterwards. Overall a great spot!!","4049":"This restaurant has a lot of hype surrounding the food, ambience, and service. For the most part, it delivers, and you'll leave content with the meal you ate in the very Instagram-friendly location. \n\nWe were only able to get a dinner reservation at 5:30 on a Saturday night. Even when we arrived at 5:15, the place was bustling. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are deliberately furnished giving a rustic-chic dining experience. Ambience definitely gets a 5. \n\nAs far as food, be sure to inquire on portion sizes and beware starches. It is \"family style,\" but the waiters choose to air on the side of ordering less. We had 3 snacks and 4 mains to share between our party of 4. Our server told us we were getting a lot of food, but after the meal we realized he was probably over-accounting for the starches. For example, both the Ribs and Salmon came with huge portions of potatoes which could cause you to fill up fast if you ate them all--which we didn't. We didn't leave hungry, but we could have squeezed in one more dish. \n\nThe 5 star dishes: Ribs--so great. The duck wings. Grilled peaches--great light and flavorful addition to the meal. The cornbread. Also the complimentary popcorn was great and neat to kick off the dinner. \n\nThe okay: Pimento cheese toast. It's good if you want spicy cheese on toast. \n\nThe not so great: Black pepper parpadelle: Hate to use this word but kind of slimy, and the black pepper didn't come through nearly enough. Would definitely skip this in the future. \n\nIn conclusion, the food coupled with its presentation in the restaurant setting are enough to generate hype. Not the best food I've ever had but definitely a good meal!","4050":"Very well done, young and hip.  Fabulous fresh and innovative food with complex well done spicing.  \n\nThe menu has an original approach of categories, plates are medium size. \n\nI would come back to SB to go here for dinner.  \n\nExcellent innovative and complex taste meal you shouldn't miss.","4051":"In town for work and found this gem on Yelp. It was fantastic! We had the oysters (HUGE) and the steak, which was cooked perfectly to my medium rare specification. Aside from the outstanding food, the vibe of this restaurant was what made the place so fun. The whole place is an open-air, open-spaced area with a busy, friendly, hip feeling. We sat at the bar and made friends with several people, as it seemed everyone there was in the best mood and happy to be there. Will make a point to go back next time I'm in town!","4052":"Every meal we ordered was amazing. We had Brussel sprouts, peach arugula salad, corn bread and a 72-hours marinated steak. I don't really remember the actual names on the menu but those four are pretty much the most ordered ones since I saw many others customers eating the same things. Among everything, corn bread was the best. We were literally speechless for a while. Definitely the dish you must have here. Better if you make a reservation at least 2 days before if you're going as a group of more than three people. This place is packed. We got lucky we got in without much of a wait.","4053":"Great unique menu.  We loved the family style food.  A little pricey but worth it.  Amazing service!  Make a reservation for the weekend though.","4054":"This is easily the best restaurant in Santa Barbara. Nic at the bar is great, the community table is the only place I make friends, bests dates of my life. Hell even the popcorn is delicious. Shout out to the triple cream on the cheeseboard and the hanger steak.","4055":"If you are in Santa Barbara for a weekend you must must come to Lark. This place is amazing all their food is great.... like you seriously cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!! Finish your night with the ice cream sandwich and make sure to order their speciality cocktails. The service is great the waiters are super nice and helpful!","4056":"This place is fine. The service is friendly and accommodating. I recommend getting a cocktail and an app at the community table rather than dinner.","4057":"Wow. I am actually going to hand this place a 5-star review. I don't do that often, but this place really impressed me. Hubby and I shared dinner here. Everything is served family style and items are grouped on the menu by size and nature of the dish. In discussing our options with our server, we were convinced we could handle 5 selections of smaller plates. Needless to say, we overestimated our abilities, but we sure had a good time trying! We had deviled eggs, the pimento cheese spread, brussel sprouts (do NOT miss these!), the beet salad, and the crab gnocchi. Every single dish was well executed and balanced in flavors. There was not a single misstep in the bunch. Despite being full, the one dish that I ate every bite of was the brussel sprouts. They had this wonderful savory\/sweet umami thing happening that I just can't put into words. Pure bliss! This gets my highest rating and my biggest endorsement. You cannot go wrong here :)","4058":"Great food, ambiance, service! I came for a friend's birthday and we split a number of small dishes and entrees amongst the 6 of us including the oysters, flatiron, chicken, and burrata and pork belly. These were all delicious although I didn't think the chicken was anything too special. We also ordered the carbonara which I wasn't a fan of as it was much too yolky for my taste and I found the papardelle a bit chewier than I would have liked. The cocktails were okay, but overall I found everything to be perfectly pleasing on the palate and not too overly seasoned which I am always on the lookout for!","4059":"OMG this place is great. Inventive dishes and cool vibe. The restaurant itself is cool and so is the area around it (called the Funk Zone).\n\nWedge salad is incredible. Tasty little candied bacon bits inside that make it way better than an average salad.\n\nI recommend getting more appetizers and smaller dishes so you can try more things.\n\nGreat cocktails too!","4060":"Wow just an amazing meal. The food is excellent and the service is terrific too.\n\nFarm to table with style","4061":"Outstanding food and service so much so that we ate there 2 nights in a row!  Had Brussel sprouts, cheese board, Lane Farms organic lettuces salad, diver scallops, grilled New York steak and the Pot de Cr\u00e8me.  All was outstanding with the exception of the Pot de Cr\u00e8me which was just average.","4062":"Great place and a great meal.  Atmosphere is california hipster would be the best way but no hipsters anywhere to be seen.  Everything we ordered was great.  The Pimento cheese app was very spicy but also very good and presented very well.  The salad of choice was the Wedge.  The details in this salad made it fantastic.  The dressing was amazing and the blue cheese and bacon along with the Pecans were very harmonious.  We opted for the chicken and were going to order the full chicken to split.  The waitress suggested we only order the half (so nice to not be up sold as we were tourists) and the potions were huge.  Drink menu is on point and also they have a great local wine list.  Highly recommend if you are in the Santa Barbara area.","4063":"Awesome Santa Barbara restaurant with an unusual fare and dining format.  The dishes are often served and designed to be shared family style. Our tendency is to over order or be concerned with dish size.  These dishes were perfectly proportioned and balanced.  Never did it feel like we were under served thou my eyes were very dubious.  Once we eat I realized I had had plenty of tasty fresh meals. \n\nI landed at SBA from the east coast and met colleagues right at the restaurant carrying my luggage.  It was unseasonably chilly but they had little fire pits out side and gas heat lamps which were perfect. The decor had a funky industrial feel. Nicely done.  Not cheap but worth a splurge. Can't wait to go back some time.","4064":"Great service and delicious food! Loved the spring pappardelle and duck confit and Brussels sprouts. The oysters came with a grapefruit pur\u00e9e that was supposed to balance out the creaminess of the oysters, but I don't think my palate is refined enough for all that.","4065":"We returned to The Lark for the second time in several years.  It is still one of the most popular places in the Funk Zone in Santa Barbara.  They have some unique cocktail offerings.  I tried the Mule, which has cucumber-infused vodka and ginger beer; it was excellent, and very refreshing.  The roasted Brussels sprouts here are to die for.  We shared the diver scallops, which comes over risotto, and the roasted ahi tuna.  Both were very tasty, and the presentations are beautiful. We sat again at one of two tables placed in an antique confessional.","4066":"Very cool foodie place!  Great service (Rare for SB!), interesting and really great food, and an energetic, eclectic ambiance.  We loved it and will be back many times!","4067":"If you are into meat prepared every weird way possible, then this place is for you. I sat at the lovely communal table, was dressed up and friendly, but each person turned a cold shoulder and it was lonely. I read the entire menu - twice - determined to have a night out in this town, and could not find one single item I wanted to order. So left, strolled down to the Fishouse a block away,and had a great dinner there with friendly patrons at the bar, for 2\/3rds the cost of the lofty Lark..","4068":"The lark never disappoints. It's one of our favorite dinner spots. Oysters, brussels sprouts, hamachi crudo, and ribs are our go to's.","4069":"Our server was able to modify the menu to make our dinner gluten free. The brussel sprouts and roasted chicken were delightful!","4070":"We had guests visiting in from out of town so we took them to Lark. They've changed up the menu since I was there last and it was great. Brussels sprouts are still a winner, beets n burrata was delish, charcuterie was just ok, fried green tomatos are a pass, roasted chicken was great but the best item was the scallop dish with squid ink cous cous, amazing. I'm going back for that one. Guests were impressed too.","4071":"The food was unbelievably delicious and fresh! The ambiance was amazing, rustic and romantic and cozy! The service was absolute crap. \n\nWe went for my wife's birthday and I informed them it was her birthday when I did the online reservation. I also mentioned it again to our waiter when he sat us. Not a word, not a candle in her dessert, NOTHING. Not only that, the waiter did not smile even once. Stoic, unenthusiastic and hard to find...on a Tuesday night. Add to the cold, unfriendly service, the constant addition of next courses served on our very small table (ridiculously so for a \"family sharing style\" place). We couldn't enjoy one dish without the next being crammed on to our table. \n\nBut, despite the dismal service, small tables, oh and the small, expensive portions (not that big a deal but had to mention it) the overall experience was great, food was amazing and we would definitely return...hopefully with one of the more personable and friendly servers. For the (high) price we paid for some delicious  morsels, the service was just awful.\n\nTip for staff: when someone reserves a table for a birthday celebration and then verbally informs you it is someone's birthday, please make the slightest effort to at least acknowledge it!","4072":"Delicious food.  We ordered several items just for the two of us so we could try everything. The deviled eggs were amazing. My chicken was cooked perfectly. Too many grits on my plate though.","4073":"My husband and I went to the Lark for a our anniversary and really enjoyed everything.  The atmosphere is great, the food is super yummy, and the service was awesome (also free valet parking - a major bonus if you're in the funk zone on a Saturday night).  \n\nThey had a personalized \"Happy Anniversary\" card at our table when we arrived and complimentary glasses of champagne and dessert which really helped to make it a lovely dining experience. \n\nThe panzanella salad, stuffed olives, roasted chicken, and pork belly sliders were all delicious.  It's a little on the pricey side, I suppose, but so worth it for a special occasion.  We will definitely be back!","4074":"What an outstanding experience. The atmosphere was welcoming and enticing, and the staff was extremely attentive. \n\nNothing is left to chance at this new venue. The attention to detail is evident from the flower pots on the wall to the cocktail\/wine list and it spills on to the food. \n\nWe had a three hour dinner which included 4 starters, 1 main course, and 2 desserts.  All along we had the resident sommelier pair every course. \n\nI hate to push the dishes I had onto people, since we all have different palettes, but I recommend this place to anybody looking for Fresh recipes and traditional dishes with a contemporary twist, Chef Jason Paluska has got himself a gem.","4075":"The food is great. Service is always terrible whenever we go. Pretty amazing considering they have so many servers and runners yet no one ever actually takes your order or brings your drink within 15+ min of taking your order (if you're lucky enough to get someone to take your drink order in the first place). \nWish I could give it more stars based on the food but when service is so poor it ruins the whole experience.","4076":"One of the best meals I've ever had! The food was delicious, the service was superb, the ambiance was beautiful and cozy. We ordered the braised lamb pappardelle, beet salad, roasted potatoes, and the most delicious cookie ice cream sandwich for dessert. If I could eat here every weekend, I would. (Alas, I live about 60 miles south of SB.) It's in a great spot by the urban wine trail, though parking is easy with valet if you're driving. I cannot recommend this place highly enough - it's just fantastic!","4077":"I took my girls here for a Christmas celebration and definitely will be back! The Brussels sprouts are a must and the chicken is great:)","4078":"This is a play by play review:\n\nWe arrived at 7:20 for our 7:30 reservation. It's a Friday evening and place is packed: a good sign. I had to use the restroom and asked one of the hostesses for directions and she walked me there! Very very good start. It's 7:45 now and we are still waiting. Don't mind it too much as I am not famished, and it's a great spot to people watch when it's this crowded. Heat lamps are on and the two fire places and fully lit. Every table is taken and the aroma of deep fried then broiled Brussel sprouts is in the air. The management is quite visible here; broad shouldered ... Hmmm looks like he is my size and a half tall, so he gotta be Blake Griffin tall, making his rounds and scoping out the entire establishment for unwanted guests... he's actually politely escorting a lost transient now away from the restaurant! Eventful!\n\nGot seated at 7:54. I was entertained so really  didn't mind. Our table is in the back, facing the opened side French door. This is such a lovely place: no bright lights , only string lights giving off enough illumination to see people's faces and your food. Kind of romantic ... except for the noise. Heat lamps are everywhere. \n\nCoffee,Belgian beer, and hazel nut beer. All good. \n\nBeet salad - beautifully arranged and delicious. Yellow and red beets, a few leaves of basil and mint, grilled strawberry halves, and caramelized hazel nuts. I would order this again. \n\nWedge salad - they use the lettuce hearts here instead of the typical full lettuce heads. Instead if being drowned in blue cheese dressing, it is lightly coated with a vinaigrette dressing with blue cheese crumbs, glazed whole pecans, and crispy cubes of pork belly. Very nice. Hubby didn't care for it as much as I, but that's his problem.\n\nBrussel sprouts - heard about Bouchon's Brussel  sprouts being better from one other yelper... not sure that's even  possible. Can't really describe it except that it's really really good. And I think it would be really good with a bowl of white rice!\n\nPork chops - their special. It was okay. The server who brought this to our table spent a good deal of time telling us what was on the plate. And it was complicated. It has good flavor, but it was served room temperature, soft and dry. Served with homily .. salty, just not sure what to make of it. And there was this green sauce that I could not figure out its flavor. The presentation was very nice though. I would not order this again.\n\nChicken - full very juicy baked chicken with crispy skin, served  on a bed of grit that had been prepared like mashed potatoes with a kick. Ham hock, pickled okra, and fris\u00e9e leaves were the side kicks. This is a five star chicken. Side kicks get 3.5 stars as I would like to have more non-salty veggies as side kicks to offset the saltiness of the grit. \n\nI would come back just for the service here. Lori and Matt were our servers. They never left us in need of anything, aside from being pleasant and knowledgeable with our orders. Throughout the evening, servers, bust people, and the management were everywhere. Everyone was efficient, polite, and attentive. I totally understand why this establishment is so highly rated. \n\nThe only recommendation to make this a 6-star place is cushions for chairs. My bony butt hurt sitting so long on their metal chairs.  Killing me.","4079":"The Lark is cool.\nIt's loud, so either get a booth or sit close to your friends so you don't have to yell each other. \nI recommend the bone marrows, cheese plates, and the scallop dish. Drinks are good but not consistent, I like the drinks at Seven down the street better.\nI came here dressing semi-casual, with a mini flowy dress with flat sandals. Most men dress in jeans and button down shirts or polo. I've seen some very sexy (scandalous) dresses but mostly more dinner-appropriate, romantic attires than clubbing attires. Fun for people watching. \nService is okay, I think I get more attention sitting at the bar than at a table.\nI wonder why they hire so many hostesses? :)\nOverall, I like this place for their food, ambiance, decor, and good for people-watching.","4080":"Must make a reservation unless you want to sit at the bar. Food was delicious but service was okay. The pretzel was so yummy and so was the tagliatelle pasta. Definitely a popular restaurant for locals and tourists.","4081":"We went here for our anniversary, and overall the experience was good. However it seems that many of the sauces overpowered the flavor of the food, almost as if the chef was trying to create a spin painting, rather then a meal that was memorable.\n\nI loved the decor, and it seems as if this area of Santa Barbara is becoming a happening spot. \n\nMy favorite items included the popcorn and the broccollini. The octopus, scallops and were a bit too odd, with too many flavors.","4082":"Walked in late and sat at the community seating bar type thing. Ordered off the snacks menu and everything was super tasty. Got the brussel sprouts, cheese plate and charcuterie plate. Music was good, met a guy at the table across from us and shared a bottle of wine. Great environment. Was a little pricy but will defiantly be back. Cant beat the atmosphere and they have valet.","4083":"Amazing food and excellent service in an incredible atmosphere!! The Lark is the hottest new place in town. You will want to go to try the food but will come back again and again to see the friendly faces surrounding you! Santa Barbara's funk zone has finally arrived! I've been twice for dinner and had amazing food every time.  Love, love love this place!","4084":"I'm a \"foody\" and love to try different flavors, and I was impressed by every dish we had, the apps to the desert. Make a reservation as it's pretty popular.","4085":"The food has no flavor. Really not worth the price. I would recommend going to Blue Owl or Black Sheep for yummy tasty food ! This place looks cool but it disappoints.","4086":"The food is good, the service is also good, but neither are great. I've been to The Lark 3 times now and had both below and above average experiences. What seems to be the same each time though is the over use of seasoning, which usually overpowers the natural flavors of the fresh ingredients they use (such as the brussel sprouts which are drenched in a sesame sauce leaving no flavor except salt) and the general attitude of being better than you given off my the host\/hostess and wait staff. For the reputation The Lark gets around town, it surely doesn't live up to it. Is the food good overall, yes, but it surely is not the best restaurant in town as many people would let you believe.","4087":"+ = Awesome atmosphere, great service\n\n- = overpriced food, style over substance \n\nGood place to take a date, or someone you want to impress.  Not great otherwise","4088":"Hip restaurant in the Funk zone. Always busy. Beautiful decor. I love sitting on the patio. This place is great to share everything. Good for groups. Great service. Great food.  Good size portions for sharing. I've loved everything we have ordered here, which is almost the whole menu.","4089":"Took three weeks to get a reservation for the time we wanted. We arrived on a chilly evening and were seated outside. It was quite windy too, which was a bit of a bummer considering it was our first time. The hostess and manager were very accommodating and got us a decent table inside despite it being so busy. The server we had breifly outside was amazing (Tessa) and Ryan, our server inside was just as great. \nAfter cocktails, we ordered the brussel sprouts and the deviled eggs. The brussell sprouts were the best I've ever had, simply delicious. The eggs, not so much. The eggs were too smoky (from the paprika) and frankly, bland otherwise. non of our party were too crazy about them. \nNext were the oysters.......sublime. \nThen the beet salad.....very earthy and delicious. \nEntree was the New York Steak with quinoa and bone marrow puree. Cooked perfectly, however, there was some connective tissue that was a little unpleasant, but other than that, a really great dish. \nDessert was a toasted marshmallow, chocolate \"Pot de Creme\". Yum.  \n\nEverything is served family style, and that really added to the fun of the meal and evening in general. \n\nCant wait to go back!","4090":"Booked a reservation at The Lark on a recommendation of a Santa Barbara resident and her rave reviews were understated!  First of all, we were driving in from Monterey and arrived 35 minutes late. The hostess called us before our arrival and was very accommodating with our delay. We were seated at a beautiful outdoor table and our waiter (thanks, Bill) was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He recommended sharing dishes and was able to modify the dishes for our eating preferences. The tomato and goat cheese salad was refreshing and delicious. The sea bass preparation perfect and stonefruit sorbet topped off a great event. Anytime returning to Santa Barbara this is a must stop for dinner","4091":"Loooove this place!! Great service and even better food!","4092":"Great outdoor dining. Nice food and drink list. Impressive service. Fun. Order the beet salad.","4093":"What a great place to enjoy a great meal!  Hanger steak with broccoli that even your kids would eat.  Brussel sprouts made the way you wish you could and great service make this a great place - tasting is believing!","4094":"Make a reservation! Came on a Wednesday at 5pm and by the time we left, it was packed.\n\nAmazing food that you can't get anywhere else. We ordered the deviled eggs and brussel sprouts are as snacks. The brussel sprouts were one of a kind - I generally don't like brussel sprouts but these had a carmelized, crunchy, yet soft feel\/taste to them. For larger dishes, we got the octopus, hanger steak, and pork belly. Octopus was very unique and had a good blend of spicy (habenero) and sweet (pineapple). I'd recommend it trying if you're feeling a bit more adventurous. Pork belly was my favorite - very flavorful and rich. The portion isn't huge but after eating it, you can feel the \"fullness\". Lastly, hanger steak was lighter than I thought which was a nice way to wrap up. The steak and broccoli comes out only slightly warm so it feels like you're eating a half salad\/half steak dish. I liked it because it contrasted well with the heavier pork belly. For dessert, got the ice cream sandwich - really liked the sandwich piece because it's not overly sweet and is not a cookie but rather a nice, soft brownie.","4095":"Food was REALLY interesting, VERY creative, and really good! Ambiance was great BUT pretty darn chilly, which I can't stand while I'm eating. Had to leave my coat on almost the whole meal.  They leave the doors open to the patio, which probably would have been warmer because of the heat lamps, but sure doesn't benefit the tables inside! Service was spot on but I felt he was a bit cold and disinterested.  It was my birthday dinner, too, and I appreciate the effort of the restaurant leaving me a note and the hostesses saying happy birthday but the server seemed annoyed when he wished me one.  I would have rather he say nothing at all then make me feel like he HAD to wish me one. I don't need my butt kissed, my boyfriend just wanted to make sure I had a good night.  I will definitely be back because the food is just amazing! I would have given 5 stars if not for the service.","4096":"I love this restaurant and would almost be willing to make the drive all the way up from LA just to eat and turn around. The food is really creative with particular attention toward a great mix of textures and flavors. The menu is so full of amazing choices! The dishes that have impressed me the most have been the vegetables but the meat and seafood is also really good. The artisanal cocktails are interesting and delicious. One word of warning, while the wait staff is pleasant and helpful, the hostesses are a bit lacking. We arrived to an empty restaurant at opening and they kept trying to seat people in the worst spots. It was sort of amusing to watch people repeatedly request a different table and the hostess having to go ask while the people just stood dumbly--sort of. It's not as amusing when it happened to us","4097":"Went on a date here with my boy friend of 2 years and I have to say it was probably one of my favorite dates. The waiters are extremely helpful on what food choices to make. We had oysters which I thought were extremely fresh and very flavorful. Their choices of cocktails were phenomenal and even though i was outside, freezing my butt off. They had heaters and blankies which was a very nice addition. Their green herloom tomatoes are to die for as well as their flank steak. I definitely recommend to try this spot but make sure to make reservations beforehand!","4098":"Really delicious food. Not a single dish was off. Very pretty presentation. Will come back","4099":"Made a res here a month ago after reading good reviews.. Just arrived and was given the Worst table in the place, butted up against the hostess stand. \nService ok.. Obviously most interested in moving tables along\nFood : beet salad ok large portion nothing special\nFarro risotto was terrible, greens were tough, and risotto was bland\nHusband had pork belly and said it was ok\nThey seem to be trying too hard to be cutting edge creative.\nSome of the food is served on wood platters, which makes you wonder how they clean them.... Health issue??\nOh and be cautious ordering wine ...my glass of sparkling was flat (obviously opened a while)....\nWill not be back. Would these owners serve this food in their SF restaurants? Don't think they'd last long if they did.","4100":"Phenomenal. Unique and artfully crafted dishes served by friendly and professional staff. In the heart of the Funk Zone, this place is equal parts hip and tasty.","4101":"A great new addition to Santa Barbara's food scene! My husband and I got to try this place over the weekend on a trip back to SB (where we lived for many years but no longer do). The food was delicious, and the ambiance was also great. The cocktails were outstanding-- I really loved the Old Aztec, which is a nice twist on an Old Fashioned that features bourbon, agave, orange bitters, and chocolate bitters. The one thing I would say that they could improve on is the wine list-- a good food experience deserves an equally good wine experience to set off the right flavor combinations. Here is what we ordered:\n\n- Deviled eggs: Tasty! I'm not usually a huge deviled egg fan, but these were good.\n- Brussels sprouts: Very good flavor! Oily but in a good way-- I think they are flash-fried.\n- Pimiento cheese: Their pimiento cheese is house-made and comes with bread for spreading. Not my favorite of the dishes we ordered but I liked that it was made in-house.\n- Little gems wedge: Good but nothing over-the-top interesting. \n- Bone marrow: A good dish. The marrow was served with seasoned biscuits and orange marmalade. The only thing I would say is that the flavor of the biscuits and marmalade, while good, did tend to overpower the flavor of the marrow a bit. Perhaps those other flavors should be toned down a bit to allow the meaty marrow flavor to make more of an appearance.\n- Spanish octopus: Nice and tender; served with Israeli couscous in a tasty sauce. It didn't have as much flavor as I hoped for, but still a good dish.\n- Pork shank: VERY good. Nice and tender with excellent bourbon glaze and tasty cornbread to soak up all the goodness. My favorite dish of the night.","4102":"The ambience is great.  Eat outside; too loud inside to have a conversation.  Menu is meant to be shared.  We ordered crispy brussell sprouts & deviled eggs to start.  Brussels were roasted and lovely.  Even folks who don't like them in general like them.  The eggs were ok, but just ok.  We ordered roasted beets, the wedge and roasted carrots from the \"salad\"\/farm section.  All were stellar.  For our mains we had crispy lamb and pappardelle and the hanger steak.  Steak was awesome.  The lamb I felt was more over done than crispy but the noodles were yummy.  Service was stellar.  My only complaint was the timing of the dishes; one second your table is jammed but then we only had the carrots... Learn to pace things in a logical way.  Two thumbs up with free valet parking.","4103":"This place is ok.  The menu sounds better than it tastes. The service was great! We went on a Friday night about 8. The wait was 1hr 45 minutes for 2. There is open seating at the bar & communal table. We got a spot at the communal table after 15 mins. It was pretty cramped but at least we were sitting & ready to order food & drinks. The handcrafted drinks are reasonably priced & tasty. I got the mule. Not something I would have more than one of though but it was still good. For eats, we ordered the fried olives, which I could have done without. Presentation is lacking & flavor was off and they were dry. Needed salt which is weird since olives are typically salty. I wouldn't order them again. The deviled eggs were ok. They were heavy on the horseradish and again light on the salt which made them seem flavorless again with the exception of the strong horseradish flavor. The little gems wedge is their version of a wedge salad, it was good but there were 2 components that did not need to be there - the watermelon radish & the flat leaf parsley. Both took away from the salad rather than added to it. Other than that it was forgetful. The best thing was the charcuterie board & the cheese board. They don't do a combination board like most so we got a half of each. They were good. I prefer the cheese over the meat because the meat board had a lot of pickled vegetables and I didn't care for them. The crostini were also too crispy. I felt like I was going to chip a tooth!","4104":"The vibe of this place is really great. it's busy, nice, vibrant and the food is good. The service is great. The only minus are: \nWe ordered the octopus dish and: there was only 4 pieces of octopus ... could have been a bit more generous!\nWe did not like the duck liver mousse: it came melting on a warm bread with strawberries. I understand that sometimes cooks want to be creative but that was really a wrong match. It would have tasted better on a non-warmed bread and paired with French pickles and\/or an orange marmalade or fig marmalade instead.\nWill try the place again because the overall experience was good and the menu has other things to offer.","4105":"Absolutely amazing!! We dined with a large group and really benefitted from its family style portions that were great for sharing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Each dish was very unique and delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and hope to visit again.","4106":"One of the better meals I've had in a while in a stunning indoor\/outdoor space. We loved the Brussel sprouts as well as the Steak Tartare with sweet potato chips. Cocktails looked wonderful but after a day of wine tasting, we skipped them.","4107":"My favorite restaurant in SB. Feels like a more urban restaurant than what I have seen in SB. Obviously its expensive but barely more expensive than the majority of the places in town that happen to be overpriced.","4108":"I used to love going here on dates. The service is normally great, although one time it was pretty terrible. I love that the menu changes every so often. Their cornbread is the best I've ever had, and I still miss it. \n\nUnfortunately, the last time I went did not go very well. I was hoping to splurge on a nice date and made the reservation and all that. I saw they had duck on the menu too. It's my favorite meat, so I was really looking forward to this night. Everything started well. Their appetizers are always great. Always get the cornbread too of course. The duck wings sounded like they would be amazing. Then the dish came and was dry, almost stringy, and just awful. Me and my date hated it. That alone brought my whole day down and I ended up never coming back because of it. It's probably been a year now. I just really love duck, and there are other restaurants downtown that charge less for it while making it perfect. \n\nI still recommend this place to my friends because I know I should have told the server if I didn't like the dish. But I was raised to never do that, so oh well.","4109":"Lark is great, but I wish they changed up the menu with more frequency. Due to the large crowds, seating can sometimes be a mess, but I keep coming back!","4110":"The meal was wonderful. The atmosphere and menu are fun. Plates are shared. Menu items are inventive without being fussy. The service is mellow but incredibly efficient and well-done. The meal was the highlight of a series of good meals in Santa Barbara.","4111":"The Lark was a last minute decision with last minute reservation (always make a reservation!) that turned out to be a great dining choice on a Friday night.\n\nWalking from our lodgings, we ended up being obscenely early since we failed to get lost and stopped in at Lucky Penny for a starter bite (more like a pizza to split between two with leftovers to take home later). As such, we did not gorge ourselves at The Lark, but did enjoy three fabulous dishes to share.\n\nThe Lark has an interesting interior complete with a stripped down 100 year old confessional tucked away where people could actually sit and dine in the booths on one side of a pair of 2-tops. They have a theme, take something old and re-purpose it for design or function. I like how they work it.\n\nThe crowd is rambunctious and enthusiastic about their social dining scene. Though, actually, the whole damn area for two blocks in every direction is like that.\n\nThe service is polite, full of suggestions, and honestly interested in how you felt about each dish.\n\nThe food was fantastic.\n\n1) Local Asparagus & Wild Arugula (Salad)\nI get heinously bored of salads very easily. The texture begins to bother me after a while, makes me feel unenthused, too much crunch, too much water, too much boring. It actually makes it hard for me to eat. Thank you, childhood aversions.\n\nThis salad takes all of the negative aspects away. With serrano ham, Parmesan, and a poached egg providing the flavors and textures that I'm familiar with and love (in moderation for the dish), the salad of endive, arugula, chive, and asparagus was dynamic from the start of the meal to the end. The greens themselves were fresh and gorgeous in taste.\n\n2) Citrus Cured Scottish Salmon\nServed on a wooden platter, the salmon accompanied by fresh dill, pickled shallots, creme fraiche and brioche was simple, clean, and delicious. I would've preferred more brioche due to the amount of dill\/shallots and creme fraiche left over. The salmon was amazingly tasty with nice thick-ish pieces to share.\n\n3) Herb Crusted Bone Marrow\nMy adventure dish for the night. Never had bone marrow, but I liked how this read. I wasn't going to order it if my dining companion refused to try it with me, but she was a trooper!\n\nServed with buttermilk thyme biscuits and an aleppo pepper\/blood orange marmalade, it was like a jazzed up and savory version of sitting down to teatime with scones, clotted cream, and jam. Except... the bone marrow played the role of the clotted cream, of course. That's how I treated this, and it was a delicious experience. \n\nIt's a great way for the trepidatious eater to try something new in a form that might be a little more familiar than eating bone marrow straight out. The tastes were delightful. The marmalade was bright, zippy, sweet, and had a hint of heat. The biscuits were fantastic all on their own. The bone marrow lived up to the praise of friends who have had bone marrow in other experiences.\n\nThis three-dish dining selection plus a nicely crafted Blood and Sand cocktail left me satisfied and happy, and it didn't hit badly in price, which was a real joy. Three fresh and well-executed dishes plus a lush cocktail didn't even hit fifty-five bucks.\n\nSold. This place is solidly good, and I would definitely return.","4112":"I planned a bachelorette weekend for a group of 7 women, this place was a great choice.  The restaurant is located in a the perfect location for access to other bars and nightlife, we had free valet at the door so no need to bother worrying about parking.  inside and outside seating were packed and flowing with fun hip energy.  inside was dark and swanky, entertaining a diverse but overwhelmingly young and vibrant crowd.  Our waitress was attentive and quick on her feet, making great recommendations and keeping our glasses full.   You can't beat the quality for the cost.  We had multiple bottles of wine, family style platters and smaller plates, plus drinks\/snacks to kick it off.  When we got the bill i was expecting the damage to be way worse.  Always the best kind of surprise when it's less than expected :)  Next time I'm in the area I would definitely return for more.  - Heather","4113":"I made a dinner reservation here weeks in advance for my birthday dinner - I only had one night in Santa Barbara and this was high on the recommendation list of many google searches.  The valet at my hotel also highly recommended it when I mentioned I had made a reservation in advance. \n\nI arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation, allowed valet to park my car - and waited outside - it was pretty crowded with several other folks waiting - it was bustling inside and there were large parties seated outside on the patio.  \n\nI was promptly called to be seated at the time of my reservation and was shown to a VERY small booth\/table in the back tucked into a corner.  I had asked to be seated away from loud and large parties since I was traveling solo and hate to be gobbled up by boisterous noisy groups as has happened in the past.  \n\nMy sever came over after about 5 minutes and we spoke for a while about what was good on the menu and I explained I was road-tripping through Cali alone for the next three weeks and it was my birthday - that I wanted the scallops and I would simply drink water for now as I did not drink alcohol.  \n\nHe left - and NEVER came back - I mean never --- I was brought some popcorn or something which I think is like their version of house-bread but I didn't have any water - and I was thirsty - I had been hiking in the day.  I watched him from afar delivering and uncorking some wine for other tables - but he did not return to mine.  \n\nI used to be a server - so I normally realize when someone is busy and cut them some slack - it's not like I didn't see him and I thought he was smoking in the back.  BUT - after about 20 minutes with no water I was pissed. \n\nI waited a little longer and decided I was not going to pay $100 for scallops and sit for 40 minutes with no water and him not even coming to check on me or chat for a quick 30 seconds. \n\nI'm used to this treatment from time to time since I don't drink - which keeps the ticket price and tip price down (so people think - I am a generous tipper - sometimes 50% of the meal) - but in my older age - it just pisses me off and I leave.  Which is exactly what I did.  I told the gals as I walked out that I wasn't going to sit and eat and not have a drink and I hadn't seen my server in over 20 minutes.  \n\nI went back to the Four Seasons and had room service - at 10pm.  Fail Lark, Fail.","4114":"We spent our fourth anniversary here last friday, and fell in love with this restaurant. The manager Skyler greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary upon arrival, and the staff could not have been nicer. Our server Lourika made our dinner the best it could have been, and I wish every restaurant had great staff members like her and Amy (another super helpful server). \nThe food here was delicious and exactly the way I had imagined it would be. I have to come back to try the rest of the menu items, as the food could not have been any better.  The kitchen staff deserves a bravo for their meals, and we will definitely be dining here again to enjoy the impeccable service matched with delicious food.","4115":"I really wanted to love this place. The ambiance is on point, lively crowd, heated outdoor seating and romantic vibe. \n\nI was at 4 stars until the last dish. Service was solid I just didn't love the flavor profile of some of the dishes (ribs). It's also a relatively upscale place that looks like you should have a reservation on a weekend night.\n\nThe starter was a buttery popcorn, it tasted like it had some vinegar as well, nice but gets all over your hands not ideal if you're wearing something nice. \n\nFirst course was the roasted red cabbage, it was simple with a mustard sauce. Tasty, only downside was it was hard to cut with the butter knife, recommend providing some thing sharper. \n\nSecond dish was 4 oysters, they were topped with some form of sorbet which masked the taste, couldn't tell if they were good or not.\n\nThird was the scallops with risotto. This was the highlight of the meal, the risotto is so creamy and the scallops were perfectly cooked and not too fishy.\n\nI would have been a 4 star if the dinner stopped here. The ribs took a little long and when they got here were way too salty. We ate most but I also got an unpleasant  surprise by one of the peppers. I can handle spicy but this one gave me tears and had to down a cocktail quickly to compensate. At $34 I wish I ordered the seared ahi tuna instead.","4116":"My clients and I went to this restaurant on a recent business trip. We showed up to The Lark so hungry that we were about to cannibalize each other. Luckily for our fellow dining patrons, the wait wasn't too long (we had a reservation, which helped). While we waited to be seated, we had martinis at the bar served by a bartender who really knew his stuff. He was sharp and on top of it, and his service and drink knowledge would rival any of the top restaurants I've frequented around the world. We were seated by very friendly and attractive hostesses who seemed to actually like their jobs (which is unusual for 99.9% of all hostesses in this world). Our waiter took our orders with impressive aplomb because he was juggling many other tables (and doing the work of five staff, but he made it look easy). His knowledge of the menu was extensive, and we loved all of his recommendations. The salad and brussels sprouts and asparagus were delightful. The hangar steak...so good. The dessert...mouthwatering. But best of all? (I'm saving the best for last...drumroll, please!)\nTHE POPCORN SNACK THEY SERVE BEFORE DINNER! Yes, folks, you heard me right. I've traveled all over the world and dined in the finest establishments known to man, and yet I have NEVER had an appetizer as delicious as that popcorn served by The Lark in Santa Barbara. I don't know what they spray it with (and do I really want to know?), but let's just say it's worth the trip to this establishment alone. It was so good, along with all the rest of the food we had, that each of us in our party bought a cookbook to take home to our wives. Let's just hope our women don't eff up the recipes and ruin the unforgettable memories of The Lark. ;)","4117":"Very fresh and imaginative cooking.  Be sure to have a look at the jumping kitchen from the outside windows. Very impressive. Our server seemed burned out. It was our anniversary and we have dined here several times before. Our expectations were moderate. The food is outstanding, but the service could really use a strong front of the house assist. Lots of young women at the front desk, but not nearly enough servers or folks busing plates. We waited one hour between appetizer and entree and finally cancelled the order. Waiter simply said, \"Ok, you want it to go?\" Uh, no, dude. It would have been nice if you or someone had checked on us like 30 minutes ago. I still think the cooking is inspired and fresh and it's worth a go, but the there are some problems.","4118":"We just recently held our wedding reception in the private dining area. The food and service was top notch and the event coordinator, Macy, was exceptionally helpful. I can't recommend this restaurant enough for those seeking out the best that Santa Barbara has to offer.","4119":"We had an early Friday night dinner at the Lark as we couldn't get reservations for later times, despite booking a week ahead.  Probably one of the trendiest places with decent food in the area hence all the hype.  Our server was fantastic - he was warm, friendly and highly knowledgeable of the menu.  As the night progressed, they took little longer and did forget some of my requests.  Overall, good food and fantastic service.  Nice date night venue.","4120":"I give The Lark a 4 for only one reason... the dessert. Everything else about our meal and service were excellent! We had the crispy brussel sprouts which were amazing. Then two mail courses we split. The blue fin tuna was also absolutely delicious and the short ribs were very good. The spicy pickled veggies were a little too spicy for me and took away from the dish in my opinion. \nOur server was excellent and they were very timely and attentive. We were really looking forward to dessert but were completely underwhelmed. The peanut butter ganache tasted like a PB&J and the apple crisp had a smoked ice cream that ruined any other flavor in the dish. \n\nI would still highly recommend going here. Just skip dessert :-)","4121":"Imaginative food and delightful cocktails in a very cool and comfortable atmosphere.  Love this place.","4122":"This is my new favorite place to eat at in Santa Barbara. A friend and I made reservations for dinner with her parents. We arrived and were promptly seated and served water as well as the delicious popcorn. When our waiter came to the table, he was polite and funny and always made sure our water and some wine glasses were topped off. We ordered the deviled eggs and cheese platter to start. The deviled eggs were perfectly seasoned...I just wish we had more! The cheese platter was delightful and the honey perfectly complemented the cheeses. For entrees, we ordered the cauliflower gratin, roasted beet salad and branzino platter. The gratin was homey and warm. I want to recreate this dish and eat it on a cold winter day. I enjoyed the beets in the salad but foimd the dandelion greensn to be a little too bitter my taste. The brazino was perfectly cooked. The skin was crispy and flavorful. The accompanying risotto and kale was near perfect. I must not have looked closely at the menu however as I was surprised the risotto was not made with rice. With that said, the flavor and texture were great. The kale was sliced thinly and lacked the harsh bitterness it can sometimes have. For dessert, we ordered the pavlova and chocolate pot de creme as recommended by our waiter. Both were exceptional. Overall, I found the meal to be very very delightful. The environment was also excellent. Our dishes were served at nice intervals over a period of two hours. Our waiter never rushed us and allowed us to enjoy each plate leisurely. It felt like a very upscale dinner at home. I can't wait to go back.","4123":"Always good food. Sadly, last time our waiter was not the best. Never refilled our drinks, someone else had to do that and bring our bread and food.","4124":"Honestly, one of the best meals I have had in a long time (I am a former employee of Gary Danko, Bix and Daniel). \n\nTim was our server and fantastic. Wine selection was fantastic and well priced. \n\nWe ordered:\nHamachi- a bit under salted but great portion and bright \nOctopus- AMAZING. Interesting, flavorful and different\nScallops- perfectly cooked, incredible Israeli squid ink couscous with pickled radishes \n\nOverall, this was a GEM and I am referring anyone I know going to SB.","4125":"We went in for a bachelorette dinner! The entrees were all amazing! We ordered the beets and burrata, smoked pork belly, and the marinated grilled hanger steak! I had the mule (cocktail) which was okay. For dessert, we ordered the goat cheese cheesecake profiteroles and the hazelnut ice cream sandwich! The desserts were all great! I appreciated the complimentary vallet! Also for the bachelorette dinner, they provided us with complimentary wine and a personalized card for the bride! How sweet!","4126":"I wanted to like The Lark, I lived in NYC for 6 years and miss that caliber food now that I live in San Diego, so I thought The Lark would meet those expectations based on all the rave reviews\/recommendations but it did not. \n\nThis instead is a hipster restaurant, located in the funk area of SB (industrial area). We came in early on a Friday night without a reservation and were accommodated. The service was good but the wait staff here is a bit pretentious (not all, but a good majority). They do have a nice outdoor area, and allow dogs which was nice.  \n\nFor drinks we got the club car collins and prosecco. The club car collins was refreshing, the prosecco was overpriced. We started with the roasted beets and burrata salad. It was good, but mostly all beets, would have been better to incorporate some more watercress to make it an actual salad. For dinner we got the prime rib for 2. The meat had A LOT of fat.. which kind of ruined it for me in addition to the meat being burnt. You lose the flavor of the meat charring it so much, so I was not a fan. We finished with the ice cream sandwich. The bf enjoyed it, but I found the brownie to be dry. The grilled peaches that came with it were good though.\n\nOverall, the presentation of the dishes is on point. The actual food is not. Having a shared plate dining experience is nothing new. This, to me, was one of those overpriced, over-hyped restaurants you come to with high expectations and leave annoyed having spent what you did for a mediocre meal..","4127":"Great service, phEnomenal food, all the way down to dessert. Seriously the best meal for decent prices. (PS the passion fruit pavlova is a heaven I've never tasted before!!)","4128":"This place I'd be visiting all the time if I lived in Santa Barbara. Vibes man. We only had a drink but they were amazing and like I said. Vibes.","4129":"I have heard mixed reviews about the establishment. Upon sitting two gents rave about the brussels sprouts and offer up a taste, and they were good. However, everything my party ordered was lacking. The yellowtail had a flavorful description. The yellowtail's plate was filled with flavors of waterlogged over sized bell pepper,    un-marinated 'marinated' cucumber, aioli that tasted like mayo with no hint of citrus, flakeless chili flakes, something red not listed on menu, and unsavory fish. The deviled eggs had little flavor of the listed items, mediocre, not great. Such simple palette teasing items left much dissatisfaction. \n\nService was slow, extremely slow. Even the gents across from us whom are regulars complained the service was unusually slow for slow night. After asking for our check, 20 minutes pass and my husband finally approached the hostess. \n\nWe left and went to 7 for a burger. They are consistent and always have a wonderful egg's florentine during brunch. \n\nOverpriced for little flavor.","4130":"Great experience!\n\nWe original were sat outside where the weather (and server) felt a little cold, but asked to be moved inside were it was much cozier. We sat in  the little confessional booth at the end and loved the atmosphere! \n\nThe Barrel Aged Manhattan is a must try! I had two and am considering going back tonight to get another! It is definitely at the top of my list now!\n\nAsk for Milad to be your server! He bent over backwards to take care of us. Asking if we had any allergies or dietary restrictions, he then brought out each item with the requested exception placed on a separate plate! We only had to mention it once at the beginning of the meal and he remembered and followed through on all the rest!\n\nMilad really made the experience for us with such friendly service. We were really blown away!","4131":"We only stopped in Santa Barbara for dinner and found the lark through yelp. We got a steak dinner, dates, and the kale salad. The bartender said we should have ordered 4-5 plates. 3 was plenty. That being said the food was great. Especially the steak!  Also had cool neighbors at bar from Napa (one through boston)","4132":"The food was really good. The shrub cocktail was fantastic! The parking area is super small, but there is free valet parking. I do not recommend the valet, as I watched them let my brand new car roll into another car, while also dropping the other car keys in the middle of the street. I enjoyed the shared plate style and the server's food descriptions, but they were a little pushy about what we should order. Our server told us we had too many heavy items, and the meal wouldn't be balanced, after our party of 6 had ordered a huge variety.","4133":"This place is fantastic. Gorgeous space with a Napa Valley California farmhouse vibe. Delicious food. Fantastic wine selection. The oysters were so fresh and presented with a blood orange granita that was a surprising and fresh counterpoint to the natural brine. The pimento cheese was hella yummy. I wasn't in the mood for dessert but the server recommended the cheesecake and it broke my brain. I have never tasted a cheesecake so light and fluffy. It was served with a brown butter ice cream, hazelnut cookie spread, and maple sponge candy. Holy wow. This is quintessential California wine country done right.","4134":"Waiter and waitress were perfect. Food was very good. The only thing that remove one star is the restroom. For me it's an important stuff, and they were really not clean. Too bad. Beside that the experience was perfect...\nI really recommend this place (beside the restroom ^_^)","4135":"Ambiance is fantastic, service was great and most of our meal was awesome too. I wasn't a big fan of our entree options (fish wasn't done well and the flavors did not go well) but the roasted Brussels sprouts and the pear and beet salad was sooooooooo good.","4136":"Great meal. Great service. Highly recommend the brussel sprouts, carrots, and pappardelle! The baby back ribs were good but the flavors didn't work as well as the other dishes. The pecan pie with hints of foie gras and duck fat was a little too interesting for my palate.","4137":"A perfect evening thanks to the waitstaff and kitchen crew of The Lark.\n\nWe had a party of 7 and shared everything. And everything was wonderful. We ended up trying nearly the entire menu and were not disappointed once.\n\nSpecial mention to the Bone Marrow Encrusted Beef Cheeks. Wow.\n\nMake reservations and if you don't drink, now may be the time to start. House cocktails were delish.\n\nCome back after you've been and thank me for the recommendation. ;-)","4138":"We tried to get a reservation for three of us on a Saturday night about a week out. The earliest we could reserve a table was 9:30 pm...kinda late for us to have a big dinner, but it made us feel very European. The place was packed, and we didn't get seated until about 9:40 pm. Our waitress did a fine job explaining the menu, and she made some good recommendations. Overall the service was very good - from hostess\/hosts, managers, waitress, servers, bus boy - all very attentive and kind at the end of another busy Saturday night. We started with the brussel sprouts, deviled eggs, and oysters on the half shell. The brussel sprouts were fantastic, and my son loved the deviled eggs. The oysters were just ok...nothing special, and the worst thing we ate all night. We continued with the beet salad and the acorn squash salad. Both were delicious! My wife and son shared the steak, and they loved it - perfectly seasoned and cooked. I had the fish special which was the neck of a fish. It was amazing...one of the best fish experiences I have ever had. We had no room for dessert, but they sounded good. The chef here is extremely creative and the service is great! The place is just too popular...plan well ahead for reservations!","4139":"The service was excellent and the food was superb.  We had a great experience tonight! The Brussels sprouts are really a stand out. We got their pastrami steak and pork belly sliders too.  We are definitely going back again.  Finally, a Santa Barbara restaurant that we can take visitors to when they come to town.","4140":"Loved it! This is what I hoped for with 'California' food.  Really interesting compositions and combinations made with super ingredients.  I loved the decor of the restaurant, a little industrial hipster, but with the fires and the little lights had this great cozy and inviting feel.  The plates weren't exactly 'small' (except for the snacks) but were all shareable and our server was great and bringing them in waves so we could settle in for a nice long meal by a fire outdoors!\n\nWe had the following:\n\nPimento Cheese Fritters (delicious)\nBeet and Burrata Salad (also delicious)\nHoneyed Carrots (super delicious)\nDuck Liver and Belgian Waffles (delicious, though the kumquats in the sauce might have been a little strong)\nBlondie Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich (perfect ending)\n\nI highly recommend!!","4141":"The Lark, the kitchen of creation and cohesion. The food here is unbelievably magnificent. I seriously need to meet the chef. \n   My visit at the Lark was amazing. My family and I were visiting Santa Barbara for a couple of days and I found The Lark on Yelp. Great reviews, dog-friendly and a quick drive from our hotel- worth a shot. When we arrived at the Lark they had opened about 10 minutes earlier and the inside was already filling up with people. We sat out in the casual earthy patio and began our food journey. First, our waitress did an awesome job explaining the menu and mission of the Lark. Farm fresh food to kitchen to plate. Perfect. After gazing at the menu we had decided on the Texas gulf coast redfish and Mary's roasted chicken. Also the brussel sprout appetizer, because they seemed to be very popular on the yelp reviews. \n    After she took our order, a man brought out a bowl of chili lime popcorn which was pretty good. A perfect starter- not filling(like bread is) but a yummy snack to start the meal. Soon after, our brussel sprouts arrived. After snapping a pic, I dove in. Oh my god, these couldn't possibly be brussel sprouts. They were unexplainable delectable. The mejool dates brought an amazing sweetness and the charr and caramelization of the sprouts with the sesame oil and sesame seeds left them bursting with a deep savory\/salty flavor. I would eat these for every meal every day if I only knew how to recreate such a masterpiece. \n    After we finished the bowl of heaven, the fish was delivered. The presentation was breathtaking but the food was even more magnificent. The fish was cooked beautifully, it had a crispy skin and a buttery flaky texture. It was amazing. The fish was served upon a tomato creole sauce, dirty rice, braised veggies and andouille sausage. All the elements of the dish were great and made so much sense when put together. The juicy, flavorful sausage complemented the decadent fish so well. A little sinful protein that amplifies the flavor of the main protein, genius. \n     After clearing yet another delicious plate, Mary's roasted chicken found it's place on our table. It looked like a dish you could find on the cover of a magazine, flawless. It looked nearly too good to eat. Almost too good to eat. My first bite of the chicken was magical. It was so juicy,tender and tasty. Chicken so delicious that I believe could only be achieved by either a highly trained chef or an experienced southern grandmother. The next component of the dish was grits. I've never had grits and both my parents hate it. When we tried The Lark's black pepper grits, we were all highly pleased. They were creamy and flavorful and tasted so delicious with the au jus also on the plate. Moreover, the grilled corn and jallepe\u00f1os were crunchy, fresh and flavorful. The charr and sweetness of the corn gave another dimension to this upscaled southern dish. Lastly, the ham hock was so sinfully tender and juicy. Again, another little protein to raise the other. Finishing this dish was bittersweet. The waitress arrived again and delivered the dessert menu. I wanted to but I couldn't :(. I was too full of deliciousness. \n     In conclusion, I LOVE The Lark! If you find yourself in the funk zone of Santa Barbara you have to eat here! Every single one of their dishes is so thoroughly thought out and executed so perfectly. My only complaint would be that you have to finish one dish to get the next. Also we got a little slower service toward the end of our meal. However the food made up for this. If i could eat here every single night, i would. The Lark is unlike any other restaurant, it is uniquely amazing.","4142":"A hip and delicious restaurant, and a must-visit when you go to Santa Barbara. We had our wedding dinner in The Lark, and our Ceremony and Wine Reception at the SB Wine Collective adjacent. I cannot say enough about the food, the team, and the combination of these two businesses, located right next to one another. Together they create a very sophisticated vibe, providing delightful wines, an elegant venue, and a delicious dinner. What more could you want?!\n\nAsk for Courtney in Events, and Alejandro at the SBWC - both were key to making the evening perfect. Thank you Courtney and Alejandro! Nicely done.","4143":"This is honestly my favorite restaurant that I've ever been to. the ambience is so gorgeous yet rustic. The food is DELICIOUS. the menu is fresh and creative, and focused on quality produce and meats. this is the best place to go for a special occasion in my opinion. just make sure to get a reservation!","4144":"Everything about this place was amazing! The food was unique and delicious. We ordered the cheese board (which sounds boring, but was wonderful), the gnocchi & lamb shoulder, the hanger steak, and an amazing chocolate dessert. The staff was a perfect combination of fun, friendly, and elegant. We were celebrating our 10-year engagement anniversary, and they made it extra special with champagne and a personalized note. \n\nYou can watch the chefs cook through the large window on the patio or from inside the restaurant. You can even reward the chefs for their amazing cooking by buy them a 6-pack of beer to enjoy after the restaurant closes. \n\nAlso, we were just visiting Santa Barbara, and everyone we asked for a dinner recommendation said \"GO TO THE LARK!\" So we did! :)","4145":"Courtney provided excellent customer service today.  It was so easy placing a Gift Card over the phone.  I was also excited to hear that your restaurant will mail the gift to my nephew and his wife.  So easy to get a Gift Card. Thank you for making a customer very happy.","4146":"Es un restaurant en la funky zone de SAnta B\u00e1rbara, si bien es una onda medio newyorkina distinta al estilo de ac\u00e1, es buen\u00edsimo. Es trendy y por eso atrae mucha gente, incluso un martes nublado. Prueben los esp\u00e1rragos y el the mule. Es caro para la media pero Muy recomendable!","4147":"Little bit expensive place, but great delicious dishes, desserts and drinks. Wonderful atmosphere and beautiful interior. High quality service and qualified staff.","4148":"Just left the Lark, and our entire party couldn't be happier.  The food was uniformly excellent. We ordered six dishes between our party, and they were all hits, although my personal favorite was the octopus.  The service was even better than the food.  We received excellent descriptions and advice, and were perfectly attended to.  I asked for some bread to take home to a sick member of our party who had to no-show, and our server not only boxed it up, she left a note on it...how cool was that?  We'll be back.","4149":"By far one of my favorite restaurants, and that's saying a lot.  I came here with a group of friends who's spirits were down grieving and the atmosphere and ambiance was an immediate spirit lifter!  From the outside patio and hanging lights to amazing libations we had a great experience from the beginning.  Fois gra and eggplant are amazing starters.  We shared plates the entire dinner and each dish is enough for 4 to share.  I'd say my favorite dish was the chicken.  It's a perfect combination of tender, spicy and sweet.  Every bite was perfection.","4150":"Excellent food and service. The fried olives were especially good, as was the pork belly and drinks.","4151":"We had the trout, cheese toast and scallops. I feel like they are trying to hard to layer the flavors, food\/ garnish accompanying dishes were either over cooked or did not blend well! We were disappointed. Trout was the best dish, fyi! Cheese toast was too spicy.","4152":"This place is not a lark. This Lark soars and sings. \n\nDowntown Santa Barbara panders to the fanny pack crowd dragging small children wearing Mickey Mouse Ear Hats. They stroll State St. in search of soggy nachos and limp pizza both of which are easy to find.  \n\nLark, in the \"Funk\" area, off the main tourist paseo is totally up market and definitely a foodie find. In fact it can go toe to toe with any hot ticket in New York. So there. Make a reservation or you too could be chowing down at a Sports Bar trying to hail some tatted, pieced, brew barista instead of a settlin gin for a classy culinary delight.  \n\nThe place is buzzin' from the opening bell till late. The communal  table in front is shoulder to shoulder, (sometimes that can be like eating at reform school, but not here), the bar is hoppin' and the large space is awash with locals and those who have done their homework. The tables a tad too close, but go ahead, get convivial, and there is no crushing rock loop to compete with and like a good movie sometimes an experience with others is enhanced by doing it with others. So the busy-osity of Lark is not off putting. Outside seating for a summer's evening is inviting, and the open kitchen with 20 or so cookin' fools is fun to watch. \n\nThe basket of popcorn arrived immediately and was one click past it's prime, but from there it was plated perfection from gullet to gizzard. The wait staff is professional and efficient. Our server not only knew the menu inside out but how everything was prepared. She said \"Me Jane, You Customer\". Very cute. She offered to orchestrate the symphony of food to come. Good idea. She was terrific and a veritable Dudamel of dining. \n\nThe Ras el Hanout Zucchini was crisp and righteously spiced. Perfect with Whiskey Sours and the correct Luxardo Cherries. Ask for extra cherries and they show up quicker than a Russian bride website. Jane good. Customer happy.     \n\nPochetta di Testa was not that juicy herb\/tapenade stuffed pork tenderloin swathed in crisp pancetta. Nope....it's headcheese. Six huge disks of thin tasty charcuterie. Hips, lips, nips, and tips all layered together with dots of Pickled Mustard Seeds and grilled thick sourdough bread. You either love it or leave it. I loved it so much I wanted to wear it. Run out of bread and a pile magically appears with cultured Maldon salted butter. Class act.     \n\nMarinated Hanger Steak can either be regal or a good reason to hang the chef. Here it was dead perfect. Served with Charred Broccoli which can be as limp as a Bob Mondale ED commercial. Not these spears. Crisp and delish with Calabrain Chili, Crispy Shallots, and fresh Mint.\n\nThe Farmers Market Pappardelle (house made and al dente) with Grilled Asparagus, Spring Garlic, Fava Beans, Shaved Speck, Pickled Shallots and Horseradish sounded complicated. It was simply outstanding. Mario Batali would have traded his Orange Crocs to have a bowl of it. \n\nDessert capped off a great meal. Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich. Miso Butterscotch Apples, Cocoa Nibs. Hard to eat it while applauding, \n\nLark is serious and playful at the same time like an excellent first date.This place is worth going steady with.","4153":"The Lark used to be my \"go to\" spot.  But we keep making excuses for why it's dropped off so bad because we wanted to keep liking it.  Until tonight.  \nThe last 4 times the food has not been as good as it used to be.  Servers don't seem like they want to be there.  My wife ordered a nice glass of wine and they gave her the cab in what looked like a champagne glass.  The topper was when the bartender spilled an entire glass of ice water in our laps with a very insincere apology.  We had to leave to go home and change.  Paid for an extra Uber ride home and then back out.  BTW, no comps or accommodations.  Looks like we need to find a new \"go to\" spot...","4154":"Along with many others, I think it's the best restaurant in Santa Barbara. I'm sometimes disappointed with fancy restaurants; they're expensive but often the food isn't incredible. The food at the Lark is incredible! Whenever I really want to treat someone, I take them here.","4155":"Incredible meal and experience all around. For starters, they give you this amazing popcorn with all kinds of spices (free refills on those too). My boyfriend and I split the brussels sprouts and the half order of chicken. The chicken is HUGE and comes with mashed potatoes, large bits of bacon, peas and this delicious sauce. Sprouts were my favorite though - def have to order. \n\nThe atmosphere is so pretty and lively - a great way to start our trip in Santa Barbara!","4156":"Uh-maze-ing! I booked out reservation on open table and there was a section to write anything you wanted in. I mentioned it was mine and my boyfriends 3 year anniversary. From the second we walked in, they made us feel so special with a greeting from the manager and a special, hand written \"happy anniversary\" card. It was like everyone there new it was our special day! They complimented us with sparkling wine also! So sweet! Now, on to the food! The duck liver mouse.. Out of this world! Also, the branzino.. Soooooo amazing! Definitely going back soon to try everything else!","4157":"Nice ambiance. Lamb tartare was very good and quite memorable as was the porchetta. Octopus was nice and very tender. Ribs too tough and service just okay. Cocktails better than beer list. Overall I sincerely recommend it. Sit at community table and watch the kitchen make it happen","4158":"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY!\n\nWe are so excited to have a real \"big city\" restaurant right here in downtown Santa Barbara.  Our dinner tonight was exceptional - I particularly loved the duck liver mousse with sliced plums and the whole roasted branzino.  My husband went crazy for the deviled eggs and slow roasted pork shank.  The service was impeccable - completely professional in every way.  I can't say enough about the wonderful experience we had.  We will be back to The Lark again and again.","4159":"Great service,great food nothing to complain about at all. Definitely worth the visit!","4160":"Awesome surprise. We hadn't planned to eat here but it turned out to be our best experience in SB second only to Buchon. Our server Jazz was very helpful and knowledgable in helping us make menu choices. The cocktails were outstanding, and the food was very impressive. Will come back.","4161":"I've had fun sitting at the communal table.  It's on the expensive side for SB, but definitely one of the best restaurants in town.","4162":"The Funk Zone is the place to be for many of the locals as well as out-of-towners. Its located two blocks from the beach and harbor. Located in a transforming industrial area and occupied by artists and surf shops, it is now home to many local winery tasting rooms and breweries.\nAt the apex of the Funk Zone is The Lark which brings California farm to table with local fresh fish and meat dishes. There are many other reviews of The Lark about the food, which is a real key part of going out for the evening but it is also having a  fabulous experience.    The service is attentive -the waiters taking the time to describe your food choices and the personable bartenders making great cocktails to be enjoyed at the bar, inside at a private table or a long communal table (a fun way to meet and chat with other people) or in outdoor area with fire pits.\nBecause of all the action in the Funk Zone, parking is tight but The Lark has top valet service -Lucas was excellent.This service is a must in not having to waste your valuable evening driving around the area looking for parking. \nYou must experience The Lark; the food, the service, and....well just go there!","4163":"It was okay but there were practically zero options if you're vegetarian besides salad and brussel sprouts. And even though I told them I was veg they're was bacon on those things too. Kinda of frustrating and gross if you don't like accidentally chomping on meat.","4164":"Beyond exceeded any expectations. What a spot! The food was divine-- duck confit, lamb belly, brussel sprouts... you can't go wrong here! An incredibly friendly, helpful, and on-top-of-it staff combined with farm-to-table sweet goodness makes this the best spot in SB. Would recommend it to anyone. Looking for anything. Seriously.\n\nLove The Lark!","4165":"This place is absolutely BOMB. Dude, the ambiance is gorgeous, hanging string lights, industrial chic, mixed with wood and brass. Outside has plenty of fire pits and space heaters to keep you warm, and the inside is friendly and bustling.\n\nI didn't sit at the community table, but everyone looked to be having a nice time. Get a reservation. I'm sure you could walk in and get a table maaaybe if you waited an hour, but just call a head, it will save you the wait. We went on a Tuesday at 7pm and it was jammin'.\n\nWe ordered The Brussel Sprouts (10\/10) The Wedge Salad (10\/10) The Half Dozen Oysters (10\/10), The Duck Wings (8\/10 great sauce, spicy and sweet, incredible lemon aioli, but there were only one or two meaty wings) The Salmon (7\/10, mostly potatoes really, with a very deliciously cooked salmon, but the salmon was small, least inventive dish to me) Apple Fritters (10\/10 hands down the best dessert) Cookies and Milk (9\/10, horchata seemed overkill but still good) Pistachio Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich (6\/10 definitely not the place for passion fruit)\n\nIncredible food, great service, dope ambiance. Definitely coming back to the Funk Zone of SB.","4166":"The good:\nNice and helpful hostesses, nice wait staff, Brussels sprouts, gnocchi and octopus, trendy and fun venue.\nThe bad:\nLong wait times (20 min to take order, 30 min to get first appetizer, had a vegetarian in the group and her entree wasn't brought out until after all the meat dishes so she had to sit there watching us eat), oysters were not fresh and were doused in an overly sweet watermelon granita, took multiple requests for water refills and bread never came despite two reminders.","4167":"I loveeeeeee this place!  Went in with a friend for a \"quick bite\" but soon realized, this place is amazing, and worth more of our time!  The duck liver & belgian waffles\nis AMAZING, the roasted beets & burrata is not just any plate, its DELICIOUS!  I also had butternut squash & quinoa which was the best squash plate i've ever had.  Our service: Milad, was also fantastic.  He waited on us hand and foot, and took very good care of us, extremely thoughtful, and very fast! I love this place and will definitely be back!  Thanks Lark! and Thank you Milad, you are amazing!","4168":"Solid food and drinks, but I have found service to be variable. Prices are also slightly out of proportion with the quality of food. Regardless, one of my favs in SB.","4169":"My boyfriend and I made reservations here for our 3 year anniversary for our first time dining here. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a happy server (sorry I forgot his name) and two glasses of champagne and a cute little postcard saying \"Happy anniversary\" or something. It was a warm welcome.\n\nWe ordered brussel sprouts as recommended, and those were so yummy. Tasted like cookies to me. I actually also enjoyed the complimentary popcorn.\n\nI ordered a wine and my boyfriend had a beer on tap. Both drinks were delicious.\n\nWe ordered the wedge as our first entree and I could have just stopped eating there - it was so good. The wedge was amazing. After having a couple bites, I was like wtf is in this sauce... and the server explained to me the process.\n\nWe had half of the chicken, which was also delicious. We didn't finish it and ended up taking it home for the next day. However, we did make room for a slice of dessert. :)","4170":"I have avoided The Lark because it sounded too good to be true, but glad I listened to smarter friends. Food was exceptional and top drawer service. Mike was our server and couldn't have been more helpful and kind. Great evening!","4171":"Cory was our waiter. Man he knew everything about everything. You all ready know the food is great. I love that they change the menu up for the season. Don't miss it.","4172":"Honestly I was very excited to come to this upscale restaurant but I was not very impressed. The service was not very attentive for an upscale restaurant. The waiter kept taking foreverrrr to come back to the table and also didn't tell us that some of the portions were family style which came as a shock when one of my girlfriends ordered the chicken and literately got a WHOLE chicken! Also not too many options for vegetarians such as myself, I had to order cheese for my dinner. However the popcorn they give you while you're waiting is off pretty great! Maybe this place had an off night so I think I will go back and give it a second chance. Hopefully The Lark can earn its 5 stars considering it is a \"5 star\" restaurant.","4173":"Great addition to SB! The atmosphere alone is worth going for. The interior is cool and has a rustic feel but the patio is the best part, completely surrounded by plants it really make the place feel cozy. \nWe fortunately had a reservation, which I strongly suggest on Friday, Sat, and Sunday!  This place books out completely so plan ahead. \nThe food is served family style which most the time I believe is just another term for charging higher prices for a regular sized dish but this place actually served the dishes a bit more generous than most places. \nWe started with the crab salad on local organic greens which was delicious. It was practically a head of butter lettuce with a nice amounting crap on it with a light citrusy dressing.  Next was the broccolini with a yogurt sauce and walnuts which was probably my favorite. The broccolini was nice and charred but not wilted and soggy. So good!  For our entree we shared the scallops which were prepared perfectly but a tad bit too salty so for future reference, I would order them unsalted. We also got a side of the Brussels sprouts which were prepared differently than most places where the big trend is deep frying with bacon:-\/ These were fried but in a fish sauce with a citrus lime flavor. So good! \nThey have a great cocktail menu but their wine selection could of been better especially being in SB and next door to wine country. \nService was 5 stars. Even as busy as they were our waiter circled around more than enough times. \n\nOnly reason I docked a star is because I don't eat meat and the selection was Very slim? I had to modify the scallops but it would if been nice to have more to chose from.","4174":"This restaurant was AMAZING!\nThe brussel sprouts were the best that I have ever tasted and worth the drive from Newport Beach alone. The Marinated & Grilled Hanger Steak was delicious and the broccoli was also the best I have ever had (I do not like the normal broccoli taste\/smell). The drinks and dessert were fantastic and I wish I could have tried all of them. \n-Everything was great and I would totally go back. Great staff, food, and atmosphere, what else could you ask for!","4175":"We returned to The Lark for the second time on Sunday, Sept 19th.  Service was again very good, a young and dynamic South African lady.  The menu had changed for fall 2014 (photo enclosed).  The mood was more stressed, could have been because it was the week-end.  Pimento Cheese Fritters were heavy. Crispy Brussel Sprouts were too greasy.  My roasted beets and burrata salad was fine, except for very hard pluots.  My husband's scallops were very good. My pork chops much too cooked (they had promised medium ...). Overall a bit disappointed. Also, we felt that we were seated (again) in the corner of the \"less welcome\". They want everyone to share the plates, but we made it very clear that each of us wanted his own main course. Unfortunately they brought one after the other, so that we were never eating at the same time. We'll give them another chance, fingers crossed.","4176":"My family and I went to the lark and everything about it was perfect. It's a really cool, leaning towards hipster place with a great outdoor seating area with fire pits and a lot of heaters. We sat outside next to a heating lamp, and it was a little chilly, but not too bad. Our waiter came and told us pretty much everything we needed to know and nothing more, which was perfect. He explained that the courses were meant to be shared and that the menu was ordered from smallest plates to largest platters.\nThe food there was excellent. I started with a cheese plate, which had humboldt fog, a blue cheese, and a creamy cheddar-like cheese. They were all very good, and the humboldt was my favorite. Next my dad and I shared the pastrami crusted New York steak, which was cooked very nicely, and was good all around.\nMy mom and sister had the mussels and the oysters, and complained a bit about the oysters being too big, but our waiter did tell us that they were the biggest batch of oysters he had seen so far.\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone, I can't find anything I didn't like about it. Our food came out pretty quickly but not too fast, the service was good in general, and the restaurant was cool. Hope to go back in the future.","4177":"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.  My dad and I heard this was the best spot in town, so even though we were only in town for one night, and didn't have a reservation, we decided to try to walk in on a lark (see what I did there)... and we were immediately seated at a great table due to a cancellation!\n\nSo glad we got in!  The food was fantastic.  Had the lamb belly, duck confit and wedge salad and a few oysters.  The lamb was obscenely good, and the confit was succulent too... \n\nI almost regretted not getting the roast chicken, though, because I saw one come out and it looked incredible.  Next time!\n\nGood drinks too.  I'd go back in a heartbeat if I were in Santa Barbara!","4178":"Farm to table style restaurant with welcoming atmosphere. Overall it was good food and cocktails but I'm not sure why it's so popular. I didn't find the menu amazing but I'm sure it changes often. The space is great for large groups. Be sure to Make a reservation! Highlights would be the staff and well chosen wine list by the glass.","4179":"Amazing food, great service!\n\nI went to the Lark for appetizers and drinks on a Saturday night. The place was packed but we managed to get a spot at the bar. We ordered beer\/wine and enjoyed both. They have really great looking hand crafted cocktails. \n\nThe menu offers unique combinations of different ingredients. We decided on rosemary corn bread with chili honey butter and brussels sprouts. The cornbread was amazing and the flavors came together perfectly. The brussels were roasted to perfection and equally as great! The Lark hands out perfectly flavored popcorn as a bar snack. I would have had this popcorn as my dinner if I could, it was that good!","4180":"Cute dinner date spot. Beautiful outdoor patio for summer nights. The crowd can be somewhat pretentious but it is expected in this type of an establishment. The food is good but it is the ambiance that makes this place great.","4181":"My husband took me here for my birthday, and we loved it! The place has a cool vibe, the service was really good, and the food was great. The cheeseboard appetizer is good. We had the half chicken, which definitely had some unusual flavoring in it, but it was fun to try something new. They bring you this spicy popcorn to start and that was cool.\n\nWe didn't know that it was family style, so just look out for that -- we shared the half chicken just between the two of us. We weren't expecting that, but in the end it was great because our waiter swore that one order of the half chicken would be enough for us both (she was right), and that way it was much cheaper than we thought it would be.\n\nGood beer, too!","4182":"Awesome meal on the patio next to one of the fire pits. Great ambience and amazing food and cocktails. We had the beets and burrata, wedge with smoky blue cheese dressing, roasted broccolini with a unique yogurt sauce and dungeness crab gnocchi and enjoyed them all. Stone fruit pavlova for dessert was lovely and had an interesting basil emulsion. Definitely a must visit in Santa Barbara!","4183":"OMG this place is so amazing! there cheese board was so good and there CHICKEN! to die for! The ambiance great too! Def make a reservation.","4184":"holy moley roley poley do yourself a favor and eat here. yes im yelling. unreal brussels, warm carrot appetizer and short rib dinner. so much love in this food.","4185":"I had the pleasure of dining here and the entire experience was amazing!! Our waitress was attentive, knowledgeable, and had a great personality. The environment was nice and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Santa Barbara weather. \nNow the food: Out of this world! We wanted to try many items so we had plenty to take home. We started with the Brussel sprouts: fantastic! Fried green tomatoes: a great twist on a southern tradition. Scallops: tender and cooked perfectly. Trout: wonderfully seasoned and the skin had a great crisp! And the sides were just as amazing. \nNeedless to say, we were stuffed but satisfied and happy! We will definitely come back!! Thanks for a great dinner!!","4186":"This restaurant was impressive in every sense of the word, our group tried the fried tomatoes and the fried Brussels sprouts which we ended up ordering more, the pasta with gout confit was one of the best pastas I ever tasted, the salads were innovative and very tasty, even the deserts were imaginative , I would go back again and again","4187":"Pros: great ambiance, great food. \nCons: made reservations 4 days in advance and got confirmation email. Called 30 minutes before showing up to ask a question, they insisted I was nowhere on their system. 10 minutes later I got a cancellation email of my reservation. I still went, showed both emails to the person talking to me, only then did she apologize and say there was a glitch in their system. \n\nVery poorly handled customer service.","4188":"Not knowing reservations were needed for a table to ourselves, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a crowded night. Luckily for us two spots opened at the communal table fairly quickly and we were greeted immediately by one of the friendliest waitresses I believe I've ever had. \n\nWith excitement (you can tell Jaz likes her job) she provided her recommendations on all the dishes and drinks and was quick to bring everything out.\n\nWe ordered the Lamb and Pasta as the main dishes and the brussels sprouts. The pasta was by far my favorite main dish. Was rich in flavor and very fresh! The brussels sprouts are TO DIE FOR! They're ridiculously good! \n\nOverall, the ambiance was cozy and fun and the food was fantastic. This is a new favorite for us and we'll be back on our next visit to Santa Barbara.","4189":"Ate here on a work trip to SB and it was delicious! The popcorn app at the table when you sit down is really fun and flavorful. We shared a bunch of items, which was a fun way to try everything, the scallops & quinoa was one of my favorite dished and the brussel sprouts were to die for!\n\nThe cocktails are also great!","4190":"I cannot express in words how AMAZING this place was! My fiance and I went here after a night in the town and everything was to die for. Who knew a wedge salad would be something I would ever rave on about? But it was seriously so good, whatever they do too their bacon is beyond great. The salmon was equally amazing and the potatoes that came with it were cooked in the best sauce. If you are in Santa Barbara, you must try out The Lark!","4191":"Came all the way from San Jose for this! My boyfriend was iffy about the menu (he's one of those guys) lol. We ordered the charcuterie appetizer, the pork belly, the octopus and the steak dish. I also ordered a cocktail I believe it was \"the mule\". Everything was delicious!!! My iffy boyfriend was utterly Impressed (nice!). The service is nothing less than exceptional.  We will definitely be returning here next time we visit Santa Barbara.","4192":"The Lark was unique in a couple ways. The ambiance is a rustic, chic feel. It's the kind of place I'd feel comfortable wearing almost anything. I went with two teenagers who were in hoodies and sneakers. The adults were dressed in nice weekend wear. \nThe pacing of our family style meal was relaxed also. It's was just perfect for us as we were on vacation and wanted a leisurely meal. \nThe menu changes because it is based on what is local and in season. Everything we tried was a new and enjoyable combination of flavors for me. We started with oysters which had a dollop of blended cucumber on top plus caviar. The oysters were super fresh and the cucumber added to the fresh flavor. Next we tried the charcuterie board. This came with this French bread toast to smash the flavorful pork into then top it with greens and pine nuts- Hearty and delicious. Then came a vegetarian pasta dish that I thought was going to be a salad based on the description so I was pleasantly surprised that it was a warm goat cheese ravioli (although not called ravioli) dish. The sauce was made with green pea. It was light and unique in a really good way. Our last dish was the scallops. I was full by then but my two picky teenagers loved them. \nTo sum up I had a relaxed delicious dinner where I tried new flavor combinations.","4193":"Everything here was wonderful. I love sharing food since you get to try so much more, so this place is right up my alley. Balanced & beautiful dishes featuring seasonal produce with attentive service. We can't wait to come back the next time we are in Santa Barbara.","4194":"The whole branzino was so delish. Chick peas, fried shaved fennel, artichoke hearts, and leafy greens with a citrus and butter sauce. The food was on point.","4195":"I really wanted to like the food at the Lark better than I actually did as presentation-wise I would say that it's among SB's finest. The food is absolutely beautiful, yet in my opinion is lacking in flavor \/ execution. My boyfriend and I ordered The carmelized  Broccolini to start, which was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night,  save for the fact that there weren't many Spears, even for a \" small plate\". We also shared the carmelized scallops, which tasted like there was barbecue sauce slapped on them, versus any kind of carmelization process. Also, although I'm a fan of saffron, the saffron rice in this dish tasted almost vinegary to me. The lamb entree was tasty and moist, yet VERY fatty. The lemon fritters for dessert were lovely. Servers were informative and attentive and the atmosphere is lively; however, for the prices the majority of food  could use more attention to taste, versus simply wonderful appearance.","4196":"Love the decor, ambiance and love the location in the funk zone.  We sat at the bar and had dinner and drinks. Friendly bartender, she was from Idaho. Had a few Cutlers Vodkas,very delicious.  The oysters lacked flavor but presentation was good. the ribeye plate was really tasty but the presentation was not very clean. All in All was very pleased with my experience.","4197":"Started with some spicy popcorn and a cocktail. Moved on to share several items. Portions are good and everything cooked perfectly. Will come back for sure.","4198":"Slow slow snail's pace slow\nSteak was too peppery\nPopcorn had weird spices \nNo bread even when we asked \nPasta was like ravioli. Sort of bland. \nBrussels sprouts was the better plate out of the four. \nTrout had high reviews and server raved about it but it was just ok. \nCrowded. People standing around near bar. We were seated in a table against the back wall and people were standing near us, blocking our  view and felt claustrophobic. \nServer barely around but it was a busy night.","4199":"The food was fantastic. Fresh and full of flavor. We had the deviled eggs and the crisp lamb. Great service and my dirty martini was delicious. My ONLY complaint, and why I gave four instead of five, is the music. For this wonderful ambience, the poppy music takes away from the coziness and profound decor.","4200":"I really loved this restaurant, but the lack of AC on an almost 100 degree night was a bit difficult. The seabass was amazing and very Mediterranean-inspired, and the tomato and goat cheese was really light and lovely.","4201":"First time here for dinner and loved it, everything was amazing and great atmosphere too! Checked in at 8 for my reservation and they say it'll just be a minute, then a minute later one of the girls working the front says hmm, it looks like someone checked in with my reservation already! Some bastard stole my table! Seriously though, WTF whoever you are who did this, that was a dick move. Anyway, it took them a few minutes to get us another table but then were seated right away which was cool since they weren't planning on 2 tables.\nThe food was amazing, started with the stone fruit and burrata, and the stone fruits in it had some great flavor and perfect ripeness. Then had the grilled asparagus with the hot Coppa, again great dish but could have used a little more of the Coppa but that's just because it was so tasty. Last had the crab and gnocchi, this one was seriously heavy but tasted great, just couldn't eat much after this since it was so heavy and rich. Finished it off with the chocolate ganache which had compressed melons and melon ice cream, another great dish.\nOverall it was so tasty I'll definitely be back, cocktails were good too, I had the California rattlesnake and liked it, could have used a little more booze in it but really when cant you?","4202":"Non-welcoming service in an attempt to turn our 200.00 table in about an hour. The food was fantastic. Recommend the beet salad.  \nMy friend and I made reservations and were seated on time. Gorgeous restaurant with lively energy. Our waiter informed us that the food would be family-style and took our drink order. Ordered 80.00 cab franc blend-delicious. This was sorta in the middle price-wise in their wine list. We ordered 4 things to share & and deviled eggs. The portions were huge and we would have appreciated of our waiter would have warned us. When we had one course left, we actually tried to cancel it and were told we couldn't. I understood this, although know it to be a load of crap, but we did order it, so ok. While we still had food on the table and wine left, and before offering dessert, our waiter offered to cork our wine so we could bring it home. We were very insulted. My friend checked her watch and we had been there for about an hour. Our bill was 200.00 for two guests. Having worked in fine dining, I actually found this very appalling. Our waiter seemed green so perhaps this was just inexperience and not maliciousness. The food was the best meal we've had in California! Recommend, but prepare to defend your table and fend off waiters trying to clear plates before they're empty!","4203":"This is my favorite new resturant. We sat at the open table since table reservations were limited. All four dishes we ordered were amazing! Popcorn, olives, meat plate and pork dish. \n\nThe pork was a wee bit dry, but mixed with the sauce and cornbread it was amazing! It's hard to choose between this and Stella mares. \n\nNice staff, props to kitchen, and great atmosphere. This is def the place to be. Im gettig the kitchen a round next time :)","4204":"This restaurant is a great addition to Santa Barbara. It gives a big city feel to our small town. The entire meal is meant to be shared but unfortunately for me, my girlfriend and I have completely different tastes in food. It did not matter because all four plates we ordered were satisfactory. Each plate we ordered, the food runner thoroughly described the plate and recommended the best way to eat it. The service was great we interacted with at least 8 different employees throughout the meal. The restaurant is connected to a wine tasting room which may explain their extensive knowledge of wine which far exceeded my expectations. I've dined at many restaurants in Santa Barbara and I would probably consider this my favorite so far. The bill at the end was surprisingly inexpensive even though we ordered more food than we could eat. I will definitely be coming here more often","4205":"Over rated and over priced. Presentation is chaotic. The bone marrow was pathetic, nothing there. The Wagyu steak was ordered medium, came medium rare, weighed an estimated 6 ounces, buried under heaps of oven roasted carrots and rutabagas. The half chicken, which arrived 30 minutes after the other entrees, looked large, partly because it was covered by a pile of chopped lettuce, which did nothing to help with presentation or taste. The best thing by far is the brussel sprouts. No chocolate on dessert menu. Service was excellent, but they need to tune up the food by including only items which enhance the taste and appearance of the main ingredient, instead of throwing in random flavors. Trying to be too creative IMHO.","4206":"What a fantastic meal.  Took my wife and friends here for her birthday and had a great time.  The food was way better than the typical country club style restaurants you find in Santa Barbara.  Super fresh and local ingredients make the food here so good.  The grilled branzino and the Texas BBQ Chicken were stars for mains.  The mussels were also amazing.  Full bar, this is fine dining in a casual atmosphere do not miss eating here if you are in Santa Barbara.  Great desserts too.","4207":"Had to try what the talk was after returning. It has a great vibe for Downtown Santa Barbara. I would go back for happy hour!","4208":"Dined here again recently and had a more solid meal. Nice to see the menu improving. \n\nPopcorn snack at the beginning was a decent blend of spice and citrus flavoring. \n\nSweet potatoes chips were a great execution of a favorite snack, if a bit less spicy than its description implied. \n\nThe carrots were fabulous. Really, with carrots this good, the granola and related accompaniment were quickly forgotten. \n\nThe octopus and its assortment of goodies on the plate was fantastic! The pickle was an excellent choice. \n\nThe pork belly was devine.  The chicarrones, while great, didn't add anything to the dish. On the other hand the raspberries and brittle were a highlight, and of course the pork itself was amazing. The pickled pepper and salad greens were much appreciated to help cleanse the palette after that fatty goodness.","4209":"Brussels sprouts soaked in fish sauce and other great flavors!!! Wonderful. Skeptical about the fish sauce but it only makes the sprouts taste sweeter... The lark burger is filling and delicious, especially with the pork \"jelly\"... I will definitely come back here","4210":"Love this place! Beautiful laid back yet classy restaurant with a wine bar attached in the back equals fabulousness! As my friend and I were killing time before our reservations, we had a glass of Syrah in the wine bar and it converted me into a Syrah fan. Both places have that artistic steampunk vibe you'd see in gastropubs these days. We were escorted from the bar to the restaurant and received excellent, friendly service! Meals are served family style so we ordered the brussel sprouts and the short ribs and they were fantastic! The sprouts were carmelized crispy with a soy & sesame sweetness and tang while the sliced short ribs had a perfectly salted bark. It was topped over a bed of flavorful farm vegetables (and I'm not much of a veggie water and I loved it!) Just these two items were perfect as we did have their cocktails to finish- the mule was awesome! They presented my friend with a birthday dessert that looked like a piece of art! I would totally come back here if I'm in town because of the awesome food, excellent service and local vibe!","4211":"We went to The Lark for our Anniversary dinner, on recommendation from a friend, and it did not disappoint!  In fact, after we decided to go, anyone  local in Santa Barbara that we mentioned it to totally raved and said how amazing it was. So... The bar was set pretty high!  It's in a neighborhood called The Funk Zone which was awesome and not nearly as crowded or touristy as State Street. The service was totally above and beyond but not in a pretentious way at all. It still felt really low key and laid back but in an upscale kind of way. We started with oysters and then had the Pork Belly (omg so good) and then shared the roasted chicken and grits for our main. Totally drool worthy... I'm still thinking about it a week later. They gave us a sweet anniversary card and a complimentary desert. The wine selection was also totally on point. Highly recommend for a special dinner!!","4212":"Not the best service. First, the hostess told us about the full menu at the bar and then the waitress gave it to us and then took it away when we tried to order off of it. at which point she brought the bar menu, which was now the only one we could order off of. If that was the case, you think she woulda stopped by sooner to ask if we wanted something before the kitchen closed :| \n\nWe ordered off of the mini menu unexcitedly and the food was as lackluster as we expected. Likely due to the fact that we already had our minds set on items on their other menu just to have the option viciously ripped away. Boooo.\n\nCool atmosphere tho but it gets really crowded and is one of the few places open later into the evening. Plus, good news for ya young things looking for a cougar, u found urself a den! Lots of older hotties here so come get ur pick. Enjoy ;)","4213":"Celebrated our 10 year anniversary here. Dinner was great! Couldn't ask for better service.","4214":"Most interesting food I've had in SB for a while. Most of it is very strongly flavored--which I love--but if subtlety is your thing, you probably won't be as enthusiastic.","4215":"What a gem in Santa Barbara. Each dish was a mixture of wonderful, fresh flavors. Our server did an amazing job with recommendations. The Crispy Brussels were amazing and set a high standard for the rest of the meal. Our other two courses did NOT disappoint. We also asked for a mocktail since we don't drink alcohol. It was delightful!","4216":"Really like the place.  Chef is from Tomball, Texas, so you know you are gonna get some smoke and some meat.  Solid wine dinners.  Getting a bit tired of it though.  Might give it a rest and come back swinging after the holidays.   \n\nP.S. To the person horrified by the mouse on the OUTSIDE patio.  Well, you were OUTSIDE.","4217":"Came in for valentines drove 3 hours to get here...\nThe food is amazing the service is great. We had the pimento cheese,  and the chicken.\nThe downside was the parking only valet and when we picked up the car there was a gash like scratch in the back of our new car!!!!!!!!!!! \nWhich ended our night pretty bad \nManagement needs to do something about being accountable for their valet service","4218":"Possibly the most interesting and deliciously unique combinations I've ever eaten.  The brussel sprouts, branzino, kale salad, popcorn and skirt steak were all incredible.  Four of us ate for $100 and it was well worth it.","4219":"Food was not good.  Ordered the jumbo shrimp and got 6 small sized shrimp for $36.  What a rip-off.  Brussel sprouts appetizer were overly sauced also.  Folks sitting next to us had the octopus and said it was bad, way to rubbery.  Had the chocolate cake....it was like an old cheap sponge-cake.  Don't know what the hype is about this place.  Do yourself a favor, find another restaurant.  There are so many good ones in SB.","4220":"This restaurant is incredible. We had our wedding dinner here and the management went above and beyond to make our evening special. The menu was exceptional, and they made sure our glasses were  constantly filled with champagne.\n\nI cannot stress the quality of the meal, the attentive service, and the overall amazing experience we had with The Lark. They will always be special to my wife and I for helping make our special day that much more wonderful.","4221":"Let me start with: best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. \nLikes: seasonal menu with great rotations and flavors \/ whatever season the ribs are on the menu is my favorite: \nDislikes: fall menu seemed to fall short last week...we even had second thoughts about the Brussels sprouts : \/  ordered oyster- too fishy\/ had the special fish of the day - neither of our party of 4 particularly enjoyed it. \nWe got cookies and horchata for dessert - pretty forgettable. \nMaybe it was an off night","4222":"Went to sb for a bachelorette and this was our favorite dinner spot! Delicious food, excellent service and can hold large groups.","4223":"Awesome new bistro in town that serves up a selection of favorites with a new twist.\nWe started with the Oysters, Little Gems Wedge and the Carmelized Cauliflower Gratin.  All three dishes were so unique and delectable!  The scallop dish I had was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Paired with blackeyed peas, spanish chorizo, grilled sweet corn, summer squash, lime and cilantro.  Fantastic.\nHubby had Roasted Mary's Chicken that was so unexpectedly juicy that my chicken will never satisfy him again.\nThe cheesecake was moist, light and fluffy...simply divine.  Their coffee is heavenly too!  Best latte I have had in SB to date!!\nOthers at our table had the Roasted Branzino with grapefruit, grapefruit and a barley risotto...a real crowd pleaser!\nThe ambiance is so cool and creative.  I loved the repurposed radiators under the community table...such a cool idea!\nThe Lark is our new favorite spot!  A must try!","4224":"Hip location and decor; great food, friendly attentive service. Definitely recommend it","4225":"This place is a hit every time!  The staff has a great attention to detail and knowledgeable.  I usually make a reservation as it can get very full at dinner time.  However, I have had great luck walking in and sitting at the communal tables too.  Their vegetarian options are very flavorful and fresh.","4226":"Fantastic meal.  Fantastic atmosphere. We sat\nOn the patio next to a gorgeous fire pit.  They started the meal with salt and vinegar popcorn. Perfect and a delicious way to start.  The pimento appetizer was delicious and beautifully spiced. We had the   12 hour lamb, the delicate squash were fantastic. We ended our meal with a cheese board and pistachio ice cream sandwich. Everything was superb!!  Our waitress Jillian was a joy.  All in all a perfect night.","4227":"Amazing service and food! We loved the shared meal format - it was an experience, not just a meal. The waiter was very helpful in explaining the choices and how the menu worked. And the food was fantastic! The Brussel Sprouts were to die for - and we loved the lamb! The desserts were really interesting and very good! The only reason I am not giving it a five star rating - it was so expensive! It was worth the night of being together - but just can't do it very often! But it is definitely worth experiencing. The free valet parking is so wonderful and they do allow dogs in the outdoor seating area. The outdoor fire pit is really nice to sit by!","4228":"Love this place. Fantastic food choices and quality preparation. Watermelon flavored spicy popcorn for a table snack? Really? What genius culinary expert thinks of this. \nThe deviled eggs are one of a kind. Wedge salad best ever.\n\nWhole roasted chicken on polenta with sweet potatoes. Damn good.\n\nThe server was excellent, and everyone is rightfully proud of the quality of food and creativity in the menu. \n\nCan't wait to go back.","4229":"I brought my girlfriend here for our anniversary and the food was delicious.  We got the pimento cheese, oysters, porchetta and the grilled hanger steak - the food was delicious and my Moscow Mule was pretty good too.  I highly recommend the pimento cheese and steak. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we had a reservation for 7:30pm and they made us wait 30 minutes to seat us (we stood waiting by the bar). Giving them the benefit of the doubt, there were a few holiday parties there that were taking up a good amount of tables. However, the host gave us a free drink for the inconvenience.\n\nOverall, The Lark is a nice place if you're looking for a cozy, romantic spot to eat.  Just make sure to get a reservation and try to show up a little early just in case.","4230":"One of my favorite restaurants! I came here for my birthday dinner this last year, and it was such a fun night! The atmosphere and vibe is so perfect right in the funk zone. I am vegan and the kitchen was extremely accommodating in making things suitable for me. The rest of my party was head over heals for the oysters! Service was terrific!  Great food, great drinks, and great place!","4231":"When work has you spending a week in Santa Barbara, you begin exploring beyond the confines of State Street. The Lark was one of my greatest discoveries. I would almost say coming upon it...was a lark. OK, sorry. No more bad puns. \n\nHaving just finished dinner next door at the Figueroa Mountain Brewing Co., I wasn't up for eating again, but their menu looked so great the wife and I settled for drinks and dessert. I got an Old Aztec, essentially an Old Fashioned with orange and chocolate bitters, and for dessert we got a glorified s'more like thing in a small mason jar who's name escapes me. It rocked. Regardless, we had to return for a full meal. \n\nTwo days later we were back with open eyes and empty stomachs. We'd made reservations, but still had to wait, though seats at the bar made it easier. This time I tried the Red Hook, and the wife got a glass of red. When we were finally seated our waitress was very attentive and knowledgable. Running through the menu we decided to skip the big plates and try a bunch of smaller ones, which was the right call. We had the brussel sprouts, duck liver mouse, pastrami cured salmon and hangar steak. Everything was great, but extra points awarded to the mouse and steak. \n\nCompared to other places in SB, this had a far more cosmopolitan vibe, which I liked, and would definitely recommend giving it a try. Just make a reservation first.","4232":"WOW! This place was amazing. The staff was very friendly yet professional plus informative when it came to their menu.  If was my wife's birthday and set her up with a card and little flower.  The food? Oh the food was a culinary orgasm. We will definitely be returning.","4233":"Very good almost fusion like food. They only take reservation for party of 8 at either 5:30 or 8pm. So we had to walk in to grab the seats at the communal table. \n\nThe waitress was also good at giving recommendations for plates to share.  The only thing I didn't quite like was my cocktail which was supposed to be a rum based drink but it tasted a lot more like tequila which I didn't like :(","4234":"Disappointing. Came here a few weeks ago with my brother to graze and drink.  I only had small plates and did not have any of the larger entree's. The night started fine with a steak tartar with a spicy chimichuri which was a solid 9\/10.  It's hard to find tartar, which I love. It was \"different\" but well done. Sweet.\n\nNext was the hamachi crudo. It was deconstructed nonsense, with hardly any fish and a bunch of crap on different spots on the plate.  Fish was fresh and delicious, but whatever was placed around it was superfluous.  \n\nThe final was \"octopus.\"  I love octopus. I have no idea what they were trying to do here. From what I recall from the server it was new, and they were trying it out. I ordered something else that they ran out of, and was suggested this instead. I pray it has been removed. It was chunks of octopus in a disgusting gelatin.  In their defense, I was probably a few drinks in, and maybe didn't pay attention to what I was going to get. The gelatin was dog food gross. I had to send it back.  I have never sent anything back before in my life. I have no idea what happened, but someone was clearly trying too hard to make something interesting instead of good. I get it, I have tried to make interesting things at my house and failed miserably. But try it on the staff first.\n\nWhy 3 stars? The place is attractive and interesting in a cool neighborhood.  Good \"vibe\". If the meal was all dish one,it would be 5 stars. I'm guessing the octopus was an experiment that quickly was abandoned.  If I had ordered the right things, it could have easily been 4 stars or maybe more.","4235":"The Lark is my favorite restaurant in town! Santa Barbara has great food but the a lot of the restaurants that are popular and that have great food seem to have old concepts, meaning white linen table cloths & an overall old-school approach. The food at the Lark is amazing. The service is great and I love the atmosphere. It's all shared plates, so it's great to go with a group of 4 or more so you can share more plates because it's all amazing! My favorites are the brussels sprouts, the wedge salad - nothing like a normal wedge salad, the chicken dish, the crab gnocchi, the pork shank.. you can't really go wrong but those are what I usually want when I'm there! Make a reservation if you plan to dine here because it is hard to get in!","4236":"Best food and service I've ever had!!! Scallops and Brussel sprouts are to die for!!! Service was amazing!!!!","4237":"Great service and atmosphere!  Food served family style and makes for a fun dinner.  So many good choices!  The Brie was my favorite.  For dinner I would recommend the sea bass.  Get reservations early!!","4238":"Our favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara  by far.. Great food and wonderful service.  Very pleasant experience. The valet guys are great as well.\nHalibut there is killer. Best fish dish in town.","4239":"Our first dinner in town was at The Lark, and with a pretty eclectic menu, we were pretty excited to dine here. There is a very small parking lot in front of the restaurant; I would definitely recommend utilizing valet parking to make your life easier (you can also try to street park on your own, but that can be a bit of a hassle). It was absolutely packed when we showed up for our 7:30 PM reservation, so definitely make plans ahead of time if you want to come. We were slightly early but got seated on the dot at 7:30. The tables are definitely a tight fit - very reminiscent of a lot of spots in NYC - and a couple of the seats are a bit unique; the ones to my right were for parties of 2, but one of the seats looked like it was in an open confessional box. Our waitress was very good at getting our food out overall, and the drink menu is pretty decent as well. My cocktail was a bit on the bland side, but the beer selection, with a few local selections and a diverse array of American crafts, was quite good.\n\nI do wish I had taken our waitress' suggestion about food, because full warning - the plates here are humongous. We did one small bite, 3 medium plates to share, and 1 platter, and it was way too much food...no platter or 2 less medium plates would have been plenty of food for us. We started out with the deviled eggs, something that I rarely eat but enjoyed the flavor of, especially the crispy pancetta on top. Of the medium plates, I would say that the squash definitely beat my expectations - combined with the chestnut mousse, it had a very earthy flavor. The duck liver mousse (foie gras terrine) had a thin jelly overlaid on top which could have been a little sweeter, but it tasted very good as well, especially with the nutty praline spread over it and eaten on warm, freshly-baked pieces of brioche (of which you are given 4 very generous slices). The scallops were a bit less impressive for me, though...the texture was okay, but I think the squid ink cous cous - aside from there being way, way too much of it on the plate, was a bit of an odd contrast. Scallops are a bit more delicate, and I felt like the cous cous was a bit on the heavy side to pair it with. Last up was the lamb shank, which is absolutely huge but with very good flavoring. The black garlic glaze really gets into the flavor of the meat, which falls right off the bone, and by itself, it is a very generous portion that one person almost certainly would not finish. That said, the side veggies were off-key, particularly the turnip, which was crunchy and just a mismatch of flavor (too bland) and texture relative to the meat.\n\nWe were too stuffed to go for dessert - we took a look around and saw it was decently sized, so we took half the lamb to go and called it a night. To be honest, the experience is probably a 3.5-star for me, but I round down because I wasn't blown away by the food, and I really do feel like less can be more. This was way too much food, and some of the dishes (like the scallops with cous cous) felt like it had a large quantity of food for really no good reason. I'd like to come back and try some other dishes whenever I come back, but for me, I did come away slightly disappointed relative to my expectations based on other reviews.","4240":"The Lark is amazing! Came here 2 years ago and again this year they did not disappoint! Came to celebrate my son's birthday .The pork chop and scallops were delicious! Service was wonderful as well as the overall ambiance ! Our server was knowledgeable about each entree and gave us great recommendations. Each entree and appetizer is shareable. Can't wait to return for another celebration!! Thank you Lark for being consistently yummy!","4241":"The duck is amazing! The best I've ever had! Complements to the chef! An amazing cook! Best biscuits too! The wine suburb! Our waiter was amazing! He hit everything perfectly! If you are ever here ask for Bill! He is an amazing waiter he won't let you down!","4242":"Food is amazing and beautifully presented!!  A must if visiting Funk Zone.  Tried the pig confit, one of the specials, and oh my delish! We also shared the asparagus and arugula salad, which was so fresh. For entree, we shared the Branzino, which was cooked to perfection!!  What a great addition to SB!! I'd go again when I'm in town!","4243":"I had read the reviews for The Lark, and took my wife out there for her birthday.  I was worried about parking, but that turned out to be no problem at all with free valet parking.  We tend to have dinner early, and were among the first seated; the restaurant completely filled up an hour after opening!  Get a reservation!  The service was first class, and the food (I had the pastrami crusted New York steak and my wife had a beet salad) was perfectly prepared and delicious. The fried castelvetrano olives were great!  Never had anything comparable before.  ONE complaint, removing ONE star from the experience.  For our 70 year old ears, it was way too noisy.  I know its the modern style to have no sound absorbing walls or ceilings, but this was over the top, given how tight the seating is.  Also, there was unintelligible music in the background, and it seemed to be two different playlists!  Otherwise, a great dinner experience.  I'll be back when and if they open for lunch and hope for a more relaxing atmosphere.","4244":"2.5 stars. There was a lot of hype surrounding this place and it was just average.  I would have given the food and server service an extra star, but the dining experience started off poorly when we checked in with the maitre'd. We arrived within the 15 min grace period for a reservation (7:28 for a 7:15 reso) and even called on our way. When checking in the maitre'd thanked us for calling and then said, but we will need you to vacate your table by 8:45 for another reservation.  Not a pleasant way to start your meal when you are actually on time within their grace period! \n\nWe started with the deviled eggs, which my husband and I thought were just ok. They just tasted too yolky and didn't have that great of a flavor. I passed on my \/bad one.  Fried green tomatoes were pretty good - good portion, fresh, grilled lemon was nice, bbq sauce on plate not necessary.  They were good, not great. \n\nThe octopus was the highlight of the meal - flavor bomb with the spicy octopus (make sure you like spicy bc it is), sweet pineapple, potatoes all over a tart yogurt.  We also had the steak and charred broccoli - hubby thought steak was over salted, I just thought it didn't have a ton of flavor, but if you ate it with all the other items on the plate, it was a tasty bite. Tons of very delicious broccoli on the plate - my other fav item was the broccoli. \n\nFinished with the goat cheese profiteroles with cranberry orange compote.  Good flavor, loved the cranberry compote.  We enjoyed this slightly savory dessert with coffee. \n\nOur server was also very good and pleasant.","4245":"This is my go to restaurant for every Santa Barbara trip. I have been there over 5 times in the past 6 months and if I lived closer, I would probably be there every weekend. The menu is always changing which is great and the wait staff is so knowledgable on the dishes.\nDon't be afraid to ask them for recommendations and tips on ordering.You will want to go with a group to fully take advantage of the family style dishes.\nGo out of your comfort zone here. I fully trust that everything will be delicious. Try something different! You will not be disappointed.\nThey have great cocktails too!","4246":"Ambience is fun and trendy! Bar area was nice and so was the bartender. Drinks were good too so would definitely return for more when I'm in the area!","4247":"All hype no game. Bland food (either acidic, spicy, or salty) so no balance of flavors. Extremely overpriced for what you get. I'm all for farm to table restaurants and fine dining, however they've missed the mark in my eyes. The ambiance is great but the food under delivers. If you're into going to a reputable spot just to say you went then this is the place for you, however if you want great food then go elsewhere.","4248":"We visited the Lark for our 15 Year wedding Anniversary. The experience was spectacular. Wonderfully prepared small dishes to share. We loved the sauteed brussel sprouts! Our server was fantastic and the hostess even surprised us with a glass of champagne to celebrate our evening with. We definitely recommend this spot...","4249":"Wonderful experience. Food was so artfully presented, and subtly seasoned to highlight the seasonal ingredients. The brussel sprouts and trout were or favorites. And the service & timing of dishes was perfect! We could not have asked for a better first dinner in SB.","4250":"The Lark is maybe my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. The chicken is the best thing I have ever tasted. I don't really love chicken, but this chicken I cannot even begin to explain, it is just amazing.  I personally love going to eat there with a few friends, the portions are on the larger side, family style, so you get a few items and share (my favorite way to dine).\n\nI have never had anything bad at the Lark. The food is unbelievable, the service is top notch. Everyone is so well educated and versed in all of the food and drinks, it is really a pleasure to dine there. \n\nI personally love that they start you off with popcorn, not only do I love when restaurants give you something to snack on (and hate it because I eat it), but popcorn is one of my favorite things to eat. So light and delicious. \n\nThe only difficult thing about the lark is that it can get loud, so if you are dining at prime time, you may want to try and sit outside, if you sit inside it is difficult to hear, then again you are so busy enjoying your food, it kind of does not matter.\n\nAlso, if you dont have a reservation, go  few minutes early and sit at the communal table (no you do not have to share food with others) or the bar, the services is usually good, it is relaxed and great people watching.\n\nIf you have not been to the Lark, go. If you have been, go back.","4251":"Quite possibly the best meal I have ever had! Absolutely not one negative thing to say\nCheese pimento toast blew my mind... spicy but paired greens and pickled peppers\nEggplant salad... couldn't understand why my wife ordered it.... AMAZING! Blew my mind.\nParpadelle (sp) pasta cant even remember the description but some of the vest flavors to hit my mouth!\nWe will come again to Santa Barbara just to eat at this restaurant!!","4252":"If you are in to sweet infused food this is the place to be.  I don't like being told how many dishes I should order or how I should eat. Seared scallops should be seared and translucent in the center not cold and masked in some sort black garlic sauce that was again sweet.  It reminded me of hoisin sauce out of a jar. That's what gave the scallops the seared effect--the tint of the sauce.  A cast iron skillet was not used or perhaps under used. The only thing I can say about the risotto was aborio rice was used but it was not creamy from the richness of the rice... it was lemony at least not sweet but not worth the calories. The little gem salad was served with glazed bacon again sweet. \nMy husband and I spent 132.00 dollars on a mediocre meal.","4253":"Hmm, I see other posts here that experienced what we experience. Food when it came..eventually.\n\nThe place was SO PACKED and it was a Tuesday. The waitress seemed more like a door to door salesman than someone who is waiting on you and trying to give you a great restaurant experience. Plus for being as expensive as it was, they should be asking you \"would you like a neck message with the grilled beef ribs?\"  I mean, they must make bank in tips. I swear I saw the busboy leave in a Range Rover. Anyway, in a nutshell, we placed our order and got this statement immediately \" ok everything might not come out all at once\"..HUH? Oh you mean the food...Oh I see, let's give ourselves some insurance that way when the kitchen backs up, then we have that statement to fall back on ;) SHeesh.. OK sure enough, when it came time  I got mine first, 5-7 minutes later another dish came out, then lastly 20 MINUTES later the last dish came. At during which time we complained and now the story changed to  \"well we serve family style\"  HUH? Oh OK, so I'm supposed to \"share my 6 (or was it 4?) small pieces of shrimp with slivers of radish and a 1\/4 cup of mashed potatoes from my 32.00 entr\u00e9e with the table? It's like a petites bouch\u00e9es for everyone..YEAH!..Not. One small addition - the menu called it \"carmelized shrimp\" and it was not in the slightest. Do what you want, but I think there's better places to eat for less money in SB","4254":"Great food and atmosphere! I would've given 5 stars if would have had a seat outside by the fire but we were tucked away in a corner. Had Brussels sprouts, burrata cheese salad, and lam shank.","4255":"WOW!!!!! This place is amazing , a must try place if in Santa Barbara, everything is so delicious!! We had the deviled eggs, with the crispy Brussel sprouts ,half dozen oysters that where from jus up north morro bay and followed with the grilled hanger steak and for dessert the goat cheese cake profiteroles! Everything was the right proportion where you weren't stuffed but full enough for dessert !! Highly recommended this place , maybe look over the menu and prices prior to going if your concerned with the price , that's the only thing I've heard when telling people to go there ! Other than that I will definitely be back !!!","4256":"Updated after finally trying the food!\n\nFirst - if you want to visit the Lark - Reservations are definitely necessary, until the management gains their senses and realizes that with a popular spot, they can sit people first come first served and turn their tables more efficiently  and make more $$ without reservations.\n\nThe Bar and the Community dining table fill up quickly, so come early to ensure a spot, or call ahead for a table. As of this writing, if you want a table outside, you'd better reserve.\n\nI actually didn't plan to eat here and had just stopped by the bar to enjoy a cocktail, but the food arriving for the couple next to me looked great (I resisted the urge to ask if I could have a spoonful of the cauliflower gratin, or a fork of the beet salad...) and since my dinner plans changed, I opted to order my own.\n\nI had been wanting to test out the Pastrami spiced Rib-Eye (I couldn't wrap my mind around it) and ordered the Cauliflower gratin.  Both were excellent, and well prepared.  The rib-eye was cooked slightly on the rare side for medium rare, which is just fine for me; and the \"pastrami sauce\" was delicious although a little strong.  The portion would be perfect to share among two people, and dining solo I took 1\/2 of it home with me.\n\nAll in all, friendly staff, great food, cool vibe;   I'll be back.","4257":"Outstanding!  Beautiful dishes that are innovative and delicious.  The lamb is hands down the best I've had. Order the full rack as its not a lot.  You will wish you had more.  Unbelievably good. Pork belly.... another winner. Short ribs are not what you would expect, but similar to a beef tenderloin. The chicken was very good. Brussels and Carrots are excellent.  \n\nMake a reservation well ahead. This place is packed!  Service is very good.  Great location with nice wineries to visit.   Excellent.","4258":"We were excited to try the new kid in town but the kid still has some growing up to do. Our server was friendly and really tried hard but the areas that let us down were the uneven pace of the food and the bar drinks. For $12 we expected more than a 2 ounce pour.  The wine was nice but a little bit of a strange wine list to me.  The highlight of the evening was the charcuterie plate ($14 for the half plate).  The roast chicken was good but for $27 for a half chicken it was a letdown. It was extremely crowded and noisy and we sat at the communal table and kept getting pushed into and elbowed by the bar crowd. The ladies room stunk (not appealing after a nice meal).  Overall..over-hyped, over priced and maybe after they work the kinks out it will be more enjoyable.","4259":"This is a must visit! Everytime I am in town I chow down at the lark , Brussel sprouts are to die for, popcorn is really cool and good and the wine list is bomb! Check it out, I have met some really nice folks at the \" common\" table in the bar area.","4260":"I've dined here several times, with girlfriends, with my husband, and with groups of friends. Staff is always super polite and happy. I love the new menu items. The wine list has reasonably priced choices that are pretty luscious (reds) and crisp (whites). Went this past Saturday and we were seated right away. Usually, we try to sit at the open table, but it's always packed. We had a great meal, great service, great wine, and positive vibes. Thank you!","4261":"Finally!!!!   A restaurant we can be proud of!!!  Being from San Francisco, a big foodie city, moving to Santa Barbara has been a tough transition.  The Lark hits the mark in every category and makes me feel at home again!  Service...stellar.  Food...fantastic, interesting, elegantly flavored, and on point!  Hopefully the beginning of a new era.","4262":"Both the food and cocktails were fantastic. Our server Danielle was very helpful when we chose our dishes and helped make for a great dining experience. Will definitely recommend this place.","4263":"The food here was great.  We chose four dishes off the Farm menu which is all vegetarian stuff and 3\/4 were incredibly good.  The tomato salad, the shishito peppers and the pasta dish, which was enough to make us go back.  We took our dog and the staff was very accommodating.  It's a cool looking place too.","4264":"This is my favorite place for a nice meal meal in Santa Barbara.  I've been here twice now for dinner and three times for their brunch. The flavor-style is very California: \"basic\" items made very gourmet and with super-fresh ingredients. Portions are designed to be shared, for two of us we usually get two (or three if we want to leave stuffed) of their smaller items and one of their entrees. It can be pricey if you get drinks and get a nice sampling off of their wonderful menu but its well worth it.","4265":"The Lark is a really fun place to eat eat dinner.  The decor is industrial chic.  The doors were open behind us so we could enjoy the night air.  We sat at a long, narrow table with a bunch of strangers.  That kind of seating can be aggravating but we ended up having a great time talking with all the people around us.  The place means for you to share dishes.  We had some starters (all great--the broccolini was a standout) and then ordered salmon, short ribs, branzino, and chicken.  All were really delicious with fresh ingredients and attractive presentation.  The service is friendly and attentive.  The prices are reasonable.  I'd go back to this place in a heartbeat.  It can be a bit noisy when it fills up.","4266":"Seriously one of the best meals we've ever had. Every dish was a discovery. Service was impeccable. Great cocktails too. \nAmbience is a bit loud but you can find your corner if you're looking for a romantic dinner.","4267":"Very rude place. I made reservation early in the day and then later in the day they said they couldnt find my name. How hard would it be to properly notify someone,huh? I will spare the chefs for poor management this time.","4268":"This restaurant has a great vibe and is located in a newly developed area off of State Street.  It uses a \"small plates\" format and is an excellent choice for vegetable dishes; we liked the brussels sprouts and beets.  Regrettably, the meat and fish selections were skimpy on the main item, and quite expensive.  The steak dish  includes four small slices surrounded by a pile of broccoli.  For our party of seven, it was enough for one bite per person.  The bite I had tasted very good.  Also, the scallop dish is delicious...it includes three scallops on surrounded by a lot of couscous a kale-type of vegetable.  I would have liked at least another scallop and a bit less of the other stuff.  I left the restaurant feeling ripped off.","4269":"Great food and service!  Popcorn as a munchie will you wait is wonderful.  Parking is a bit hard and the bill can easily get super high.  For a special event the Lark is great.","4270":"I was in S.B. on a mini vacation celebrating my bf's Birthday and we both enjoyed everything about The Lark.  I had the salmon and he had the chicken and it was delicious.  We visited other fancy restaurants while we were there and The Lark was definitely our favorite one.","4271":"4 Star food \n4.5 Star Service\n1 Star wine list, this was my biggest disappointment, just inland from Santa Barbara is a vibrant wine region and The Lark has crap wine from South America at high prices and too few CA choices. \nGet with it!","4272":"I got in to town with coworkers and needed a place for dinner. Our front desk person Christian recommended Mexican and the Lark. But told us we needed a reservation for the Lark. I was getting settled in my room and my work friend said she called and we couldn't get a reservation but we could sit at the bar. Cool to us! We had Brussels sprouts, pimento cheese and cocktails. All delicious and Andrew was amazing. The chicken was fabulous and even between the two of us we could finish it. Desiree was an awesome manager and even said goodnight to us on the way out to our uber! A very nice and welcoming end to our first night in Santa Barbara! Everyone we talked to in our industry tonight was jealous we went there! Good choice by far! Thank you Andrew and Desiree!","4273":"Amazing service and each dish was jam-packed with an assortment of flavors and ingredients we couldn't even pronounce. Definitely recommend the Duck Confit Wings and the Japanese Eggplant","4274":"Came here for our 10 year wedding anniversary and wow! What great ambience, food, service, and drinks. Being from San Diego we went off of Yelp reviews and we were not let down. We sat at the confession table and that was kinda neat. Thanks for making our experience great!","4275":"Must say so impressed by the staff here! Thank god San Fran came to the rescue and brought amazing staff with them. Our waiter mike was amazing and so knowledgeable about not only every wine but also every dish! I would love to meet the \"brand\" women from target who thought of this gem! (One of the owners) Great space, valet parking and a great menu for sharing food! \nWe started with 5 deviled eggs, yep u can order as many as u want. They were the best I have had and my personal ones are my fav. These had a kick of jalape\u00f1o and of course smoky paprika. Brussels sprouts great flavor, as well as broccolini, salads were fresh and beautiful especially my love for the Santa Barbara beets. The organic greens with the fresh crab was a shared treat with great taste. Sharing the salad was great so that we had room for the San Luis Obispo oysters which I would say were my favorite dish. Well that is next to the Branzino which was incredible! We all loved the almond romesco sauce with the the chick peas, fennel and fried onion on top. My only regret was seeing the neighbors plate next door with the 1\/2 chicken dish that looked amazing and they said it was! Next time....\nNot a dessert fan but they looked great and the table seemed happy... Overall a great dinner for 5. Make sure u call for a reservation for more than 4 especially if u want to sit outside. Open table only takes 4 tops even a week out... Unless u call : ) so why not call... Also check out the amazing wine bar in the back who also represents the wine for the Lark, amazing!!","4276":"Can't rave about this place enough. We came here on a last minute decision, over Bouchon's. Let me tell you something... WOW!\n\nWe came here because it was very close to our hotel and the reviews were stellar. we were celebrating our anniversary. We showed up with a bottle of nice champagne and proceeded to the front desk. The hostess told us that there was no tables available and they were booked for the evening. We were bummed but a manager came by and asked us if there was any issues. He had us sit outside for a few moments and wait.\n\nAfter waiting for about three minutes, we were seated at the communal tables. We enjoyed some of their finest foods. The cheese boards and meet boards are out of this world.\n\nWe enjoyed our anniversary dinner and had the time of our lives.next time we are in Santa Barbara, we are definitely going to return.this is a hotspot you don't want to miss. Make your reservations ahead of time. They book very fast. \n\nI can't wait to visit them next time SB is on our road trip venue!","4277":"I consider myself a foodie, and this is one of the best restaurants I've ever experienced. The dishes were inventive and delicious. Wonderful atmosphere as well. You will not be disappointed.","4278":"My new favorite restaurant in the the USA.  Great atmosphere, the best service and the food!  Very inventive and imaginative menu.  We had the best of Brussels Sprouts ever, beet salad was amazing, crudo was lovely.  Highly recommend.","4279":"this place quickly became our favorite restaurant yet... and we eat out a lot.\n\nwe made reservations for the latest time available on saturday night: 5:30. it was just my DH and i celebrating our babymoon. the menu looks a little exotic and might sound weird, but trust me, everything tastes good. the flavors will mesh.. they know what they're doing.\n\nthey started out with complimentary seasoned popcorn which was delicious. very well seasoned and a little spicy. we had the deviled eggs, the half chicken, and the lark burger (secret item not on the menu!). the half chicken was extremely moist with a nice crispy skin. we normally don't like grits, but we couldn't stop spooning this into our mouths. \n\nmy DH said the burger was the best burger he's ever had. that's quite a statement. they gave us a complimentary dark chocolate mousse for dessert. everything was so good and we cannot wait to come back. 4 thumbs up from us!","4280":"We came to The Lark for my Bachelorette dinner and it was one of the most memorable meals of my life. Unbeknownst to me, my maid of honor planned a 3 course menu with the restaurant. The charcuterie plate and cheese plate were insanely gorgeous, no one wanted to even eat them they were so pretty, but filling! The first course was their take on a wedge salad and we polished off every plate. Their Brussel sprouts were out of this world- tasty from whatever fat they cooked them in (duck, pork? who cares!) The lamb pappardelle was rich and well-balanced. But the OCTOPUS. I don't know that I've had better octopus in Greece or Italy, it was THAT GOOD. So light, no chew to it at all, over Israeli couscous that was in a bright tomato broth. Their Mary's Organic roast chicken was perfection; I could eat just the skin and be happy. Their bone marrow-crusted beef cheeks were as good the day after as they were the night of the dinner. Their pastry chef is brilliant, each of her 5 desserts were a hit from the sesame seed pot du creme, the peanut butter and chocolate explosion, meyer lemon tart (my favorite), vanilla bean ice cream sandwich, we ate it all! We had one member of our group who has a serious dietary restrictions and they couldn't have been nicer or more helpful in making sure her meal was just as good. \nThe drinks were just as well-balanced as the meal. \nBeyond the food, the service was exemplary. \nDo yourself a favor and check this place out. Their lovely patio has LOTS of heaters to keep you warm, and the communal seating inside adds to the ambiance. \nThank you, Lark!","4281":"Food was excellent - service equally as awesome. We had wedge, shishito and wagu beef and all were amazing and perfectly cooked. My wife loved the Paloma and I enjoyed a nice hazy IPA. Highly recommend.","4282":"Would definitely come back here again. Crispy Brussels were great, not soggy and good combo with the dates. Nice craft cocktail menu. Nice ambience","4283":"Expensive, but kind of worth it. The Lark brings a collection of foods I've experienced around SB into one restaurant. I feel like they copy other restaurants, however, they make the same food taste just as good.\n\nThe service is great. Our server(s) were very kind and conversational. The cocktails are superb and the family style portions are perfect for petite eats. Great lighting in the restaurant as well.\n\nMake it better: I'd like to see some originality in this company. The style of their food isn't one genre and can get complicated. I'm not sure which opened first: The Lark, or Sama Sama Kitchen. Either way, someone copied the other's brussel sprout dish.","4284":"The service did not offer an alternative to my friend when she ordered a strawberry daiquiri. \nThe door staff was very rude about us only wanting a drink.\nThe communal table was cool and the popcorn was delicious.\nOur waiter did not offer us the complimentary popcorn, our table mates had to give it to us.\nNot worth the terrible attitude!","4285":"One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara, not only is the food AMAZING but the service is excellent. They always ask if anyone has any food allergies and are very accommodating, if that is the case. \n\nThe brussels are out of this world, I always love whatever salads they have on the menu and my favorite drink is the mule. Let's not forget about the popcorn, they bring out instead of bread - it wins. \n\nIt's a busy place so I suggest making a reservation about a week before! It's such a fun restaurant in one of the best areas in town. It's a must-see or should I say eat in Santa Barbara!","4286":"Consistently busy, The Lark offers diners great people watching, with a menu offering a touch of everything. The prices are higher than most local restaurants, the quality of food and experience make it well worth it.  The wedge salad is one of my favorites, as were the muscles with an amazing thai inspired sauce. \n\nThe community table is a fun way to dine without reservation and also meet people from all over.","4287":"I previously wrote a review stating that Lark served very small drinks which gave an otherwise great experience a cheap veneer. They must have read the review and if so congratulations! I am here tonight with my husband and they have been serving very generous drinks... as a result we have ordered three rounds and are happy to pay a higher bill.  Thank you Lark for being \"long\" sighted, you have now earned a good share of stars.","4288":"Started us off with some free bubbly for our anniversary with a cute card. Nice touch! We started with the kale pear salad-yummy but could have used more pieces of Brie. My husband got the deviled eggs and I got the oysters. Yum. The pappardelle and risotto were good. Our only complaint was that the Figueroa Mountain Danish Red Lager that my husband got was $18 and we purchased one from the actual brewery next door for $7.50. That markup seems pretty extravagant.","4289":"We had a local cheese and charcutrie platter followed by a small portion of short ribs and it was scrumptious from start to end. Make a reservation as it's pretty popular.","4290":"Here for a banquet. Often a good restaurant serves a mediocre banquet but not this one. The food was simply amazing. A creative menu, well executed. Service was outstanding.","4291":"Delicious!! What more can I say the atmosphere was amazing, service was excellent. Drinks were awesome and delicious. Food outstanding! I would definite go back.","4292":"I can't rave enough about how great this place is! We started with the deviled eggs - so good! Even had a piece of bacon sticking out of them. Brussel sprouts were to die for - such a great flavor. Next came the heirloom tomato salad. Everything was so fresh! Finished off with the risotto. Fresh peas, grilled fennel. My only regret was not saving room for dessert!!","4293":"Vibrant and cool with tasty brussel sprouts. Two of the coolest people to come out of SB...Rico Reeves and Mary Marovic have been known to make cameos. They insist on sitting at the community table despite their SB star power. Their presences puts the Funk in the Zone.","4294":"Was visiting Santa Barbara for the first time for the weekend and after looking for restaurant recommendations, this place popped up on Zagat's 10 hottest restaurants in SB.  Made reservations ahead of time and we were promptly seated when we got there.  I didn't know about the outdoor seating when I made the reservation, and wish I had, it was beautiful outside.  We started off with two of their cocktails, the Red Hook and the Moscow mule, which were both delicious.  We ended up ordering the brussel sprouts, beet and burrata salad, pork belly, bone marrow, and crab gnocchi.  Our favorites were the brussel sprouts, beet and burrata salad and bone marrow.  This place would have gotten 5 stars but the pork belly and crab gnocchi fell short of our expectations.  The pork belly was too dry for my liking and the crab gnocchi did not compare to SF's Beretta's.  Service was great though!","4295":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in Santa Barbara, even topping Bouchon which is lovely but has less creative offerings. What's to love about the Lark? The FOOD, the ambiance and the experience. \n\nDetailed experience: You pull up to the lark and are offered free valet service. Even during busy times you are quickly attended to by the hostess. Went this past Sunday with my boyfriend without a reservation and we were quickly able to get a spot at the communal table. The waitress promptly came over and took out drink orders and gave us suggestions on how to order. They suggest you get 2-3 small plates and an entree for two people which we did. The plates come out in a rolling fashion so you're never left hungry or wondering where your food is. We ordered deviled eggs, brussel sprouts, baby broccoli and grilled octopus as our entree. All were extremely delicious though my favorite was definitely the brussel sprouts because of their flavor and crispness. The grilled octopus would be a runner up for taste but we only found 4 small pieces of octopus in the dish so that was a little disappointing.\n\nAll in all we had a lovely dining experience with delicious food and great service. Can't wait to go back!!","4296":"I came here with my girlfriends for a bachelorette party. We had to make reservations and create a set menu in advance because our party with too big. \n\nFood:\n\nWe started with the crispy brussel sprouts, deviled eggs, and little gem wedges as appetizers. The brussel sprouts were delicious- crispy on the outside with a hint of lime. I also liked the wedges which were tossed in smoked blue cheese and topped with spicy pecans, watermelon wedges and bacon. The deviled eggs was just ok.\n\nFor entrees, my girls decided on grilled octopus, duck liver mousse, marinated & grilled boneless short ribs, and whole roasted chicken. The only entree I loved with the boneless short ribs. The meat was very tender had the right amount of seasoning. The rest of the entrees did not impress me- everything was just ok. In addition, our roasted chicken was a bit dry.\n\nlocation:\n\nAlthough the their parking lot is a bit small, there is a lot of parking on the street. The Lark is also surrounded by quite a few bars and lounges. \n\nService:\n\nWe did have an issue with our order- we ordered 2 plates of marinated short ribs and 1  roasted chicken; however, we got 2 roasted chickens and 1 marinated short ribs. They did not fix the order but comped 2 of our alcoholic beverages. All in all, the service was super friendly.","4297":"We had Wyatt as our server. He was more than impeccable. We went of for our anniversary, and they provide free grape wine, so definitely mention it. Customer service was great as well. The ingredients were extremely fresh as they are known for using locally sourced products.\n\nThe Brussels sprout was our favorite. I really want to love this place, but we find that the flavors were too powerful for our taste. Of course, we like our things more natural so it may be good for others. I think if they try to tone down the flavor just a little bit, it definitely has a 5 star potential, and that is pretty high in my bar.","4298":"This is a must visit in Santa Barbara. The ambiance is great, the food is hands down amazing, and the drinks and service here is impeccable.\n\nCame here for dinner on a nice Saturday night - my friend had made reservations for 9 pm (called earlier in the week and that was the only slot available). We arrived around 8 to see if we could get in, and they happened to have a free table for us.\n\nWe were seated outside near a small fire pit next to the bar so on a cool southern california night it was perfect. This restaurant is great for groups because the menu is designed for sharing and you can try all the different flavors the Lark has to offer. \n\nAfter ordering drinks (I got the Smoke 'n' Roses - that had a great smoky mescale), we were served some of their signature popcorn - AMAZING. We even had seconds! \n\nFor our table of 4, we ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, the Pear and Red Kale Salad, Crispy Smoked Pork Belly, Pappardelle and Lamb, and Roasted Arctic Char. \n\nThe brussel sprouts are a MUST order - the most amazing I've ever had. The kale is nice and refreshing, and the Pork Belly is sweet and tender that it just melts in your mouth (a must order as well!) . The pappardelle is handmade and the lamb was tender and crispy. The Arctic Char had a great flavoring too. \n\nThe entire staff there is accommodating and attentive and my whole party was very pleased. Our waiter even mentioned how all the chefs begin preparing in the morning at 7 am so that all the food served is the most fresh! \n\nI will definitely be coming back!!","4299":"Yum yum.  So I'm a popcorn ADDICT so you get the picture - they have it and I love it.  Sitting at the communal table is awesome and the drinks are great.  The service is pretty good.  I really like the place.  The Funk Zone is the better for it.  Very chic.  Could it be better?  Maybe just a tad but they still do a great job.","4300":"That tasty popcorn starter by itself is a solid 5 stars \n\nFianc\u00e9 had the Old Aztec cocktail - while it was spot on, the friggin single ice cube takes up 95% of the glass so I don't feel like you're getting $11 worth of cocktail.  I had the mule, which was very refreshing and more generous with its pour.\n\nAs for food stuffs, we went with the broccolini, gnocchi and pork shank.  Yum-O!  All great flavors, but the odd man out was the cornbread that accompanied the pork shank - tasted like it was over cooked and too crispy for what you'd expect out of cornbread.\n\nNonetheless, a lovely atmosphere (sit outside if you can), solid service and delicious food...all make for a satisfying dining experience :)","4301":"Was a bit skeptical, however, the food was very nice and the drinks incredibly unique. Who uses garam masala in a cocktail? The Lark does!, and it was both beautifully dressed with a flower and quite tasty. The smoked duck? - Amazing with the duck mousse. The smoked salmon play on chips and dip? Sooo good. It's served with salt and vinegar chips (which I personally think are gag worthy), but Lark has changed my mind. Our waiter was amazing. He brought a sample of the chips for me to taste and they changed my mind immediately. I actually ordered MORE because I was eating them so fast. \n\nI was so satisfied with the quality of the food here. Looking forward to coming back. \n\nMy only suggestion is to take better care in wiping down the tables (mine could've been cleaner and was definitely sticky in places) and ensuring that the area from the bar to restroom is safe. I was in solid heels with rubber ends and almost smashed into the floor turning to come back from the bathroom. I wasn't even walking fast. That is a big safety hazard. Other than that, I had a great time.","4302":"We chose this place based off of other yelp reviews and were very pleased with the choice. Great food, ambience and great service and in a cute neighborhood. Interesting menu. My husband and I ordered 4 dishes to share. All were excellent (oysters to start, beet and mozzarella salad, steak, squid and pineapple). Beets salad was my favorite. We also ordered the hazelnut ice cream sandwich for dessert which was delicious.","4303":"Best meal I've ever had. Totally awesome atmosphere. Called at about 6 on a Tuesday night, and they couldn't seat a party of two until 9:15! So that tells you what an incredible place this is. Pimento Cheese Toast, Pepperdelle Pasta, Eggplant deliciousness!  We will come back to town and stay in a hotel JUST to come back to this restaurant!","4304":"the best Brussels sprouts that I have ever had! They are cooked to perfection and are just so tasty!\n\nOur waittress sandy was wonderful, she has the best service that I have ever gotten in Santa Barbara. Wonderful place!","4305":"The Deviled Eggs and Southern Pimento Cheese were phenomenal. I'm not normally a fan of either, but I'm glad that friends got me to try both. I only had these two appetizers, but the other options sounded adventuresome and beyond.  \n\nBased on the rave reviews, I'm sure I'd like most things on the menu, even though they didn't stand out to my non-foodie palate on first glace at the menu.\n\nGreat seating area on the patio, comfortable seats, heating lamps in the winter, trains going by and blowing their horns. All brings character outside. \n\np.s. Complimentary popcorn to start you off with very different and interesting flavors.","4306":"Oysters. Kale salad. Off menu burger with jalapenos and bacon. Goodnight Gracie. Place is consistently fantastic.","4307":"This was my first time at The Lark. The service was nice at first. I didn't understand why when I realized my Salmon was under cooked they just heated up the piece I had!! The waitress even admitted it was raw. When they brought the plate back to me with same piece of Salmon the waitress says sorry we have a new cook. They didn't even discount the meal or anything. Not really somewhere I would go back too!","4308":"Swanky and fun. I have eaten here a number of times. The cocktails and food are great.","4309":"Great service, food, drinks, everything was perfect. four of us tried the lamb, chicken, hanger steak, brussles and hedge salad and all was great.\nPrice of dinner was reasonable, I will be back soon.","4310":"We were just walking through the funk zone and stumbled upon this place. It was busy but the ambience was nice with the fireplaces and the dim lights. We got lucky to grab a seat at the bar and our bartender was on point. We ordered the Old Fashion and the Whisky Sour. Wow! Excellent drinks!! We had already had dinner so we didn't eat but the food I drooled over looked gooood!!!!!","4311":"We came here after a long evening in the funk zone. It always catches my eye when we are in SB but I always forget to make reservations. \n\nWe were able to get a table on a busy Saturday night but we did have to wait an hour. It might have been a shorter wait for the bar or communal table. The waitress must have said five times that it was family style restaurant and that her job was to make sure that we didn't order too much or too little. I've lived in So-Cal long enough to know that this just means they make dishes that are a just slightly too small to be a full entree but definitely the price of an entree. That way you are tempted to buying three plates for two people on average. I wasn't too hungry so I ended up getting the scallop dish which came with this amazing corn polenta. Note that they call it a \"platter\" and charge $34. It's not really a platter, more like three large scallops spread out artfully on a plate. Unfortunately they were out of the pretzel which seems super popular as the people at the two tables next to us also tried to order it. \n\nAnyways, the flavors, ambiance, and drinks were excellent. Definitely met my expectations and all the hype.","4312":"So much fun. Food is fun. Ambiance is fun! Crowd is fun! Great spot to start the night!","4313":"My girlfriend and I went to the Lark after a friend's recommendation.  It was a busy Saturday night, but we were able to get seats at the bar right away.  The food was great, the cocktails were fantastic, and the service was excellent. The bartender Ben was extremely knowledgable of cocktails and liquors, and made for an all-around perfect experience. I would highly recommend going here - we will definitely be back!","4314":"Have been there twice now and I just don't think I'll bother to go back unfortunately. The decor is totally awesome! They did such a good job with it but decor doesn't keep you coming back to eat. The first time I was there, I went with girlfriends shortly after it opened. We had great drinks, our appetizers and platter were very good but the service is just so snotty and unfriendly. Then I went back with my husband recently. We made a reservation and showed up on time. The hostess said she we needed to wait a bit. That is no problem with us but normally they tell you how long so you know whether you should go to the bar to get a drink and chill while you wait or whether it'll be fast so you should still around. In addition to waiting, they don't even tell you where to stand so you are just floating in the middle of everyone's way, dodging and weaving to let waiters and patrons past. After a bit we decided to ask her how long it would be. Again, we don't mind a wait and were there to have a good time together. We only wanted to know if we should hang at the bar for a bit. When my husband asked her, she said in a snotty tone that she is just waiting for the other hostess to arrive to take us. Again, that told us nothing about timeframe. The other hostess brought us to our table. I sat in the booth which is pretty high but it is a nice height. My husband sat in the chair across from me. The chairs are way too low. He is tall and he looked like the table was at his chest an that I was 3 ft taller than him. I have no idea who picked those chairs for those tables but bad idea! The food we ordered this time was 'okay'. I really wish they had more salad an appetizer options to choose from and that there were more vegetarian options. We eat meat but sometimes, when you go to a great restaurant that has a fantastic vegetarian meal, it is nice to choose that. What is up with most of the servers and people who bring the meals here having almost zero personality!","4315":"Great food ambiance and staff. Love this place. The popcorn they serve complementary is delicious, the Brussels are to outstanding.","4316":"Wow, this place was amazing.  Everything we had turned out to be the best version of that item we ever tried.  The deviled eggs, oysters, steak, they were all amazing.  The flavor of the hanger steak was amazing, and it was cooked perfectly.  The ice cream sandwich is worth trying as well so save space for dessert.  We had to wait 3 hours for a table (our fault for not making reservations) but I'm glad we waited, totally worth it!","4317":"I am visiting Santa Barbara, and was happy to find such a gem of a restaurant. The ambiance is lovely, just as if you make you are walking into an old industrial railroad station. The service was excellent. And such a great area to go early to check out the urban wine trials and fun local breweries. The only thing I found frustrating about lark is it makes it difficult to dine as a vegetarian. They have great snacks and salad, but do not offer any substance if you are hungry. Also It can be difficult to get a reservation so call ahead.","4318":"We made the fortunate mistake of going here for our first dinner on our 4 night vacation to Santa Barbara. It was SO GOOD that it's set an impossibly high bar for the rest of the trip. The flavors in each dish hit all of the notes. The wine pairings were fantastic. The ambiance is quintessential for the \"Funk Zone.\" The staff (and especially our server, Wyatt) were absolutely 5 star on their own. If there weren't so many great places to eat in this city, we'd be tempted to take all of our meals here, and possibly brush our teeth with some of these amazing dishes. So good. Even the brussel sprouts (usually not my favorite) were mouth-watering. If you try one place in the Funk Zone, this should be it.","4319":"Good food. Great atmosphere. Perfect for groups.","4320":"Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday at The Lark this year and no regrets!  We indulged quite a bit since it was a special occasion =D \nGreat beers to choose from and creative cocktails were accompanied by a wonderful popcorn snack while we decided on what we'd have to eat.  We got pork belly, crab gnocchi, and pork shank.  Of all these, I'd recommend the crab gnocchi the most, it was out of this world.\nWith as much as we spent, I do think the dessert should have been comped for his birthday, but oh well.","4321":"Went out for dinner at The Lark and it was so delicious!  Great ambiance, too!  I do recommend making reservations as the line was out the door and wait time was several hours.","4322":"Was planning to have dinner here but ended up meeting up some friends who were in Santa Barbara at the same time and grabbing a bite. We ended up mainly having some drinks and dessert here. The location is nice and the patio is very inviting. I will say the they make a mean old fashioned. Also, the free popcorn is pretty damn good. We kept asking for more. We did have the oysters which were fresh and tasty and for dessert we had the Roasted Banana Pudding. This was killer and worth going to just for this dish alone. I cannot recommend it enough. I look forward to going back there soon for a proper dinner.","4323":"I'm somewhere between Yay! and A-Okay. The service and atmosphere were excellent. I enjoy the urban funk and Santa Barbara has been lacking a place like this. The drinks ranged from okay to good, the beer list was excellent and the server even knew the beers.  The wine list was also good but in SB that is less of a surprise. The produce in the food was excellent but for a shared plates restaurant, the plates were not very intense. They were good but there were no standouts. It is a good night out with friends or date-night restaurant.","4324":"One of the my most favorite places to visit when I'm in town. My husband and I discovered it on a suggestion from a valet a beautiful hotel we stayed at a few years ago. So glad that he recommended it, it was and still is a special place for us. The food is magnificent and the locale is beautiful. My only complaint would be two things, the service isn't always consistent. We've been received extremely well and other times have been ignored badly. I wish there was more consistency. And lastly, the mixed drinks are not my favorite. They just don't do it for me, so I prefer to stick with their wine selections. Prepare for Top Chef status and pretentiousness, but memories to last for a Santa Barbara lifetime.","4325":"I've only been here once, but the meal was superb! If you want to go, you might need a reservation.","4326":"Delicious food....chicken was so juicy and tasty...they even made spinach taste good! Negative one star for the obnoxious drunk lady two tables over we had to put up with unfortunately....","4327":"Great service, food was impeccable. The Deviled Eggs were the best Ive ever had I think...","4328":"Although crowded and loud, the food is fabulous, the servers know their stuff, and the selections are unique. A younger crowd, but we boomers as well. Patio will take your dog!","4329":"Had the great pleasure to dine at Lark this evening.  The food is off the charts good, my wife and son had the ribs and I had the chicken.  The service was top notch.  They make sure that you are prepared for the staggered servings which makes the entire experience that much more enjoyable.  The staff lets you know up front generally how long things take to prepare.  The salads were phenomenal and the appetizers were all you hoped they would be.  Looking around the restaurant and seeing how many people were laughing and enjoying their meals tells me we were not the only lucky ones to be dining their tonight.  I highly recommend the Lark.","4330":"Absolutely loved the new beet salad with pluots and burrata we had last night. Cheese plate always yummy. Glass of Grenache from Kermit Lynch. All good to go. Everything is incredible, but one of the best reasons to go is Skylar. Seeing his smiling face as a constant will start your night off with a bang.","4331":"The hostess staff are horrible - they're snobby, late with reservations, and do NOT come find you at the bar 5 feet away from their station. I would recommend that the management provides better training for them. \n\nAside from that, the drinks and food are lovely.","4332":"Truly exceptional food, service, ambience and location. We are foodies from Portland and had an amazing meal here. Our server was fantastic, really knowledgeable, sit outside by one of the beautiful fire pits under the lights. Really great value as well, we will be back.","4333":"I was in Santa Barbara with friends over the weekend and we were looking for a place to grab dinner. My friend has great Yelptuition (the ability to sift through local options and find the perfect spot) and she decided on The Lark. I will never doubt her (not that I ever did). I loved everything about our dinner. We started with the deviled eggs and the fall pear & red kale salad. Both amazing. The dressing was perfectly acidic, the pears were caramelized beautifully, the eggs were lovely, all amazing. The next course blew my mind. \n\nHAND ROLLED PAPPARDELLE & CRISPY BRAISED LAMB\nacorn squash, grilled radicchio, goat gouda, soft poached egg, rosemary\n\nSeriously, I would consider organizing a religion around the worship of this dish. It was perfection in a bowl. The soft-poached egg pulled everything together in a creamy, comforty goodness. The lamb was braised and then flash-fried, giving it a satisfying crunch. I can't stop thinking about it. I wish I could marry it and have its babies.\n\nThe next dish is the only reason for the missing star:\nGRILLED SPANISH OCTOPUS\nisraeli couscous, guajillo chile, preserved blood orange, avocado, charred scallion, spiced peanuts\n\nIt was incongruous with the rest of our meal, in that it just wasn't that great. It was good, but the octopus was slightly overcooked, and I've still never had an Israeli cous cous that I can get on board with. It wasn't bad, just not as stellar as the rest of the offerings. \n\nFinally was the roasted chicken:\n\nMARY'S ROASTED CHICKEN\nbrown-butter\u200b smashed yukons, smoked onions, bacon, pea tendrils, texas bbq jus\n\nIt made me want to smack my momma. This is what Sunday dinners should've been THIS WHOLE TIME! It was juicy, bacony, buttery, and perfect. \n\nOn top of all this deliciousness, the cocktails were nothing to sneeze at and our server was warm, personable and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this spot if you're a local and I know I'll be back.","4334":"Many locals and out-of-owners had recommended this place to us so we had to give it a try.  \n\nLoved the lively atmosphere and the rustic interior.  \n\nFor starters, we had the Deviled Eggs which was delicious!  It had crispy pancetta, jalape\u00f1o, paprika, and chive.  It was almost good as the Park Tavern ones in SF.  I had ordered a Club Car Collins to drink, but it took about 15 minutes to come out which was annoying.  Drinks should come out first!  At least, it was a tasty refreshing cocktail.\n\nNext was the Roasted Beets & Burrata.  First thing I thought when the plate came out was....WOW, what a huge portion!  That's when we realized we had probably ordered too much food.  It came with various colored beets which were fresh and sweet, but I got sick of it after awhile.  \n\nThen we had the Pineapple & Habanero Glazed Spanish Octopus.  Again, another big dish.  This was definitely entree size in my books.  Came with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, pickled carrots, and a coriander-lime yogurt.  I liked that the octopus was not chewy, but it was too soft, almost a mushy texture.  Not sure why.  Fingerling potatoes were good, but you can only eat so much potatoes.  After this dish, I was full and didn't want to eat anymore.\n\nWe almost wanted to cancel the Farro Risotto, but our server advised that the kitchen most likely started cooking it already so we told them to hold off on bringing it out for a bit.\n\nWhen the risotto finally came out, it was almost unappealing to me because I was so full and didn't really want to eat any.  It was so unfortunate that I felt this way and couldn't enjoy it.  Risotto was cooked well and had fresh English peas (my fave!) with olive, and feta cheese.  It was good, but I wish I could have enjoyed it more.  Didn't care for the big chunk of grilled fennel though.\n\nWe ended up sharing some risotto with the couple next to us because we didn't want the food to go to waste especially since we couldn't take it with us.  Funny that it turns out the couple lives in SJ as well and was visiting so we chatted with them for a bit.\n\nOverall, food was good.  Service was okay.\n\nOur server explained to us that food here was family style and that she'll stop us if we order too much, but clearly she didn't.  She was friendly and chatty, but hard to get a hold of when we needed something.  She also didn't bring out the complimentary popcorn until we asked for it when other tables around us were getting them.\n\nOverall, I wish they would make the portions a little smaller as for 2 people, you can easily get sick of the food.  The amount is actually quite overwhelming at least for us from the Bay Area.","4335":"While we were in Ojai vacationing, a few locals mentioned that we should definitely visit \"The Funk Zone\" of Santa Barbara.  The Lark was right next to Les Marchands Wine Bar, which we visited on the first night and we noticed it was really a happening place.  We read the reviews on Yelp and our aesthician at the spa also recommended it.\n\nThe place was very packed on a Friday night around 6:30pm.  The wait for 2 would take until 9:15pm!  However, the hostess kindly explained that the bar and \"communal tables\" (huge tables open to all, first come first serve) were available and she even helped let us know who might be leaving soon since they had paid their bill.  I didn't get her name, but she didn't have to do that.  The place was obviously packed and they really didn't need our patronage.  So that was points on the customer service.\n\nWe found a spot at the bar, and Bri was our server\/bartender.  She made wonderful recs for our drinks:  the Red Hook is a smooth whiskey, and my friend had The Mule which was very refreshing.  We ordered the Branzino (also rec by Bri) and it was well cooked, flavorful and just a fun dish.  It looks deceivingly small, but was a perfect dish for two. They start you off with a popcorn flavored with a bunch of stuff.  Different, but I liked how there was a zest of flavors involved.\n\nI personally like the ambience, but it may be a little loud for some folks.  For me, it had a nice cozy feel but there was plenty of \"white noise\" from all the conversations going around.  If you don't like sitting close to people you don't know, not the place for you.  The wait staff are very attentive considering how busy the place is and other people checked on us even though they weren't waiting on us.  Thanks again to Bri for making really great recs","4336":"Dined at the Lark this past Sunday with my husband and our friends who were visiting.  We were seated on the outside patio which I thought would be too cold but ended up being really nice with the heat lamps.  It was pretty packed for our 6pm reservation.  Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. For drinks I ordered the Milano and my friend ordered the Red Hook. For food we ordered the brussel sprouts, Santa Ynez salad, the New York steak and the Salmon special.  For desert we had the ice cream sandwich and pot de creme.  Everything tasted delicious.   \nNow why not 5 stars?  Our waitress was very nice in saying in the beginning that if there were any food allergies to please let them know and they would make sure that the dishes were prepared as needed by the chefs.  My husband happens to be allergic  to nuts and avocados.  Which we noticed were in the Santa Ynez salad so he knew not to eat it.  However,  when we ordered the salmon special we did not see any indication that there were Almonds in the dish.  When the dish came and was described to our surprise there was a mention of almonds.  When we asked to have it remade without the almonds our waitress had a little attitude and said \"That's why I ask you to mention food allergies in the beginning\".  I didn't agree with that,  if the menu doesn't mention nuts in the dish how are we supposed to know that there \"might\" be nuts in the dish?  I thought that was bad customer service and it made my husband feel self conscious about his allergies.  I think that the Lark should be very specific about their ingredients on their menu.  My husband does not like to announce his food allergies unless there is a specific need to.  As dinner went on it seemed as if the waitress was trying to make up for the comment which is why I will consider going back to give Lark another chance.  Everything was excellent aside from that occurrence.","4337":"We had to argue to get a table when there were at least a half dozen open, simply because we came by for drinks and dessert. So sorry to bother you with our business!","4338":"The service at this Funk Zone restaurant is fantastic. The atmosphere is great; it's cozy and a bit loud but for a restaurant the serves family style being cozy with more opportunities to talk to neighboring diners or at least eavesdrop on them unhindered is part of the fun. \n\nThe food itself is where it begins to unravel for me. At a dinner of brussel sprouts, bone marrow and biscuits and whole branzino the individual elements of each dish were well executed but failed to come together in a way that made me want to come visit again.\n\nTake the marrow dish; as a lifetime member of the marrow addicts club I can appreciate the generous helping served up. But pairing the fatty marrow with an equally buttery biscuit was a bit too heavy handed for me. The accompanying blood orange marmalade was appreciated as a way to cut through all that fat but was difficult to pair with the biscuit--buttery biscuits disintegrate too easily--and seemed a poor fit with the marrow itself when tasted together. Or take the branzino; a delicate fish prepared in a lovely style with a good fry in the skin then paired with some fried items on top--fried on fried was again a bit heavy handed. The accompanying sauce was delicious but was a bit thick in texture and and muddled in flavor to pair with such a delicate fish.\n\nThe brussel sprouts...ok, they were epic. But the meal can't stand on the one dish alone. \n\nI like the free popcorn served at the beginning though; a very playful start to the evening.","4339":"We were expecting a fabulous dining experience on our last evening in Santa Barbara since the restaurant was recommended by a local we met.  We were very disappointed! We read many positive reviews but we were not impressed.  We read service was impeccable.  We were warmly greeted and given an outdoor table as we requested.  After that our waiter service was ho-hum. The crispy brussel sprouts were good but way too many on the plate!  The house made pimento cheese was excellent.  The duck liver mousse had too many competing flavors and we could not taste the duck liver.  Crispy smoked pork belly only fair.  Crab gnocchi was mushy with uncomplimentary flavors.  Chef does not need to recreate the wheel.  Overall too many competing flavors.","4340":"Decided to eat here based on the high star rating on yelp.  This place did not disappoint.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  The atmosphere was pretty cool as well.  Had great service too.  The only complaint that I would have is that their alcohol was quite pricey.  My husband ordered a single Macallan 12, and it was $22!  But overall...the food was amazing, that's why I gave it 5 stars.","4341":"My husband and I are always on the hunt for some good foodie fun.  Before visiting Santa Barbara we did our \"research\" to find the top places to try out, and the Lark clearly made the list, and for good reason.  We were particularly excited to try it out as we heard so many of the locals raving about it; a good sign of an outstanding restaurant. \n\nComing from San Francisco where foodie restaurants are litered amongst pretty much every street at all price ranges, it's sometimes hard to find restaurants that offer the high quality, freshness, and unique flavors that we've come to love of our local eatery finds. \n\nThe Lark was right up our alley - seasonal ingredients\/menu with interesting flavors that showcase the seasonal flavors, along with beautiful presentation.  And the price point is great; definitely affordably priced for the quality you receive.  And HUGE portion sizes compared to those we are used to in SF!  We were happy with everything we tried:\n\nPopcorn (4.5 stars) - delicious little snack to keep you happy as you await your food items to arrive (we actually asked for a second dish)\n\nGreen Fried Tomatoes (3 stars) - This was a new menu item, so the waitress said they were still trying to perfect this dish.  We were going to go with the brussel sprouts as those looked and smelled amazing; however, we thought the fried green tomatoes went well with all the other items we were looking to order.  The consistency of the tomatoes and the crispness of the fried batter was excellent.  I think it just lacked the punch of flavor we were looking for - somewhat bland and under-seasoned.\n\nBeets, Strawberries, and Burrata Plate (4 stars) - If you're a beet lover this dish is great (and this plate is huge!). My husband only had a few bites, as he's not quite a fan of roasted beets - but he still appreciated this dish.  The burrata, strawberries, and nuts all paired nicely with the beets, particularly the yellow beets.\n\nYellowtail Hamachi Crudo (4 stars) - Very fresh and light; the flavors of this dish (Navel orange aioli, marinated cucumber, pickled fennel, chili flake) all were so interesting and fresh.  Great dish for spring\/summer.\n\nMarinated & Grilled Hanger Steak (4.5 stars) - This was the clear winner in our book.  So full of flavor; loved the addition of mint and crispy onions.  We thought it looked a bit light on the meat (less than the 5-6 ounces we were told it would be); however, we were satisfied with the amount of food we ate overall.\n\nThe service was okay - the wait time between each dish was definitely long.  But the kitchen seems super slammed, as the restaurant was packed.  The wait didn't bother us, though.  The atmosphere provides a fun place to chill, and we were content sipping on our well-made cocktails and snacking on the free popcorn.\n\nAll in all, we were happy with this place and would definitely recommend.  We also really liked Finch & Fork.  Both are great restaurants.  Just depends on what kind of food you're looking for and the atmosphere you want to dine in (the Lark is more our preferred atmosphere (fun casual vibe), but a \"nicer\/fancier\" locale that the Finch & Fork offers is also appreciated).  Would  go back to either!","4342":"Everything you've already read. Fun atmosphere (prefer the patio) and excellent food and drinks. Had a great dinner here.","4343":"After 5 years we still love going to the Lark - truly spectacular dining in Santa Barbara.   The vibe is also awesome and the whole Funk Zone around it is the place to be now.   Our only regret is how fantastically popular this place has become - reservations are a must or prepare for hovering over someone at the communal table to leave!","4344":"Omg the Brussels sprouts are the best I have ever had!! This place is extremely busy and very nice crowd ! Food is fancy but very tasty. We got a burger that's not on the menu but it was good :) came for my bday and got a birthday card, a little dessert would have been a nice touch but overall it was a nice experience.","4345":"We went at 5:30 with no reservation and they sat us right away with the condition that we gave the table up for a 7:00 RSVP. 1 1\/2 hrs was plenty of time! Brussel sprouts and gnocchi are a must order. Staff was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu with great recommendations and advice based on our food mood :) love love love","4346":"One of the Best restaurant's in town, hands down.  The beef cheeks are out of this world and it is almost impossible to get in without a reservation (the mark of creative culinary genius).  Have a nice glass of wine on the gorgeous outdoor patio next door while you wait and enjoy a romantic, relaxing evening.  But be warned!  Without a reservation, you'll be waiting all night!  The Community Table and bar seating is also a fun (albeit loud) option as well.  MASTERFUL is how I would best describe it in one word.  :)","4347":"The Lark is The bomb! Pricey but worth it! Every bite we took created an amazing happy sensation! \nA true party in your mouth!! \n\nStrongly recommend the crispy Brussels Sprouts and the Southern Pimento Cheese! \n\nThe Goat cheese cheesecake Profiteroles -- amazing!!! Very flavorful! The Carrot and Creamsicle cake is great if you love Carrot cake. Hazelnut (alcoholic)  latte will warm up your body and soul!\n\nSuperb experience! Friendly staff! Decor is warm and classy! Delicious drinks too! They surprised me with two drinks based on some ingredients I like... Winner!!","4348":"Hosted a team dinner in the private room.  The venue was perfect.  Staff was top notch and the food was exceptional.  I booked this venue from word of mouth and was definitely not let down.  Will definitely be going back the next time I am in Santa Barbara.","4349":"Our dinner was delicious!!! The five of us split the chicken, short rib, branzino, kale salad, arugula salad, pappardelle, and ceviche. It was amazing (and very filling ). We sat outside and the atmosphere was beautiful. Our waitress Mary was very nice and accommodating. We had a great experience!","4350":"Tasty tapas.  Our favorite was the brussel sprouts.  Dates provided an interesting slightly sweet flavor.  It was a fun meal and everything we had was good.  The hanger steak was served over grilled broccoli that was cooked perfectly.  Most people overcook broccoli and it was great to have it bright green and with its flavor and texture.  .","4351":"Maybe my expectations were a little high going in but we were really disappointed with the food and service at The Lark :(  It seems the kitchen is trying to make very interesting dishes (the menu does look great), but the execution isn't there. The dishes are too busy and drown out the flavor of the food. For example, we had local Seabass which was covered in a salt and pepper sauce so you could not even taste the fish. Even the veggies were smothered in the sauce. Very, very salty and the fish was also really dry and crunchy. We also had the oysters which sound amazing on the menu and they were drowned in a sweet sauce so you could barely taste the oysters themselves. Even the Brussel sprouts were drowned in a sweet vinaigrette. Finally, we had the Porchetta and Burrata which is supposed to be a dish they are known for according to the waitress and about 80% of the Porchetta was tasteless fat. The non-fatty parts were also very tasteless and mushy. The drinks were also overly sweet, overly spicy and overly salty. I normally love well seasoned food but maybe this place is for those who love saucey foods...\n\nAlso, our waitress forgot a bunch of things and never even asked us if we enjoyed anything so that was also disappointing. I told another waiter about the Porchetta being fatty because for me, I just couldn't bear eating it, and he said, yea, it depends on the cut of the meat and that was that. So maybe our expectations of the dishes were off. \n\nWe loved the ambiance (it's a little loud and busy but a very fun place) and the menu seemed great but overall, the execution wasn't there for us. If this place was in a bigger city, I don't think it would survive. Maybe we'll give it another try since the reviews are so good but I think if you're a true foodie or farm to table fan, this place will be disappointing. I think farm to table means that the food is celebrated and you can actually taste it rather than the food being all about the sauce, salt and sugar.","4352":"Every bite we took was a revelation. Thank you for making our 25th anniversary so special. \n\nOne star off because the chairs on the patio are miserably uncomfortable for those of us carrying a wider load. They dig into your hips and since the fabulous food is meant to be enjoyed at a nice slow pace, by the end of the meal, I was squirming in my seat, shifting from side to side, and in pain from my hips being in a vice grip throughout dinner. Next time I will request one of the few bench seats I saw outside, although I don't know if you can request them. \n\nWhen I mentioned this to a girlfriend who also has a larger frame, she said she only sits inside because of the uncomfortable, pinching chairs on the patio. I'm posting this in hopes that when it comes time to replace the patio chairs, management will use more inclusive chairs. \n\nSo, for most folks, Lark is a solid 5 stars. For heavier folks or Kim K, beware the patio chairs.","4353":"Awesome dinner! We had the best table possible, outside by the fire pit. It is a popular restaurant so make sure to make a reservation.  Danielle was our server, she was amazing! Explained the menu, gave us a great wine recommendation and checked on us regularly. The food was equally amazing, you can certainly taste the locally source product. The Wagyu Short Rib was the highlight","4354":"My wife and I heard mixed reviews on The Lark and thought we would give it a try on Saturday night.  The decor and ambiance is fun and fitting for the funk zone.  The wait staff were on it.  This had the beginnings of a great experience and hopefully a new favorite place. \n\nI ordered a medium-rare rib-eye and my wife order the 1\/2 roasted chicken. (Two staples that any good restaurant should be able to do well).  My wife's food came about 10 minutes before mine.  Her chicken came with polenta, which was terrible.  It was like they melted 4 sticks of butter into it.  We could not get the taste out of our mouths until I took a bite of my rib-eye.  The cut of meat was poor and it was so over salted that I thought I was eating a salt lick. To make matters worse, the vegetables were swimming in the steak's au jus, which was a salt bath.  I generally never complain about food but I told our server that the steak was inedible.  She apologized and told me she would let the chef know.  Later a manager came over to apologize (a little too much - which made us even more uncomfortable) and offered us a complimentary dessert.  We declined, as we just wanted to get out of there and I was starting to feel very ill from the salt. \n\nBy the time I got home, I was physically ill from the dinner.  Did I mention that the steak was $34?  They still charged us for the steak even though I had not eaten most of it and had told them it was inedible.","4355":"Where do I start?!?\nThe staff was super friendly and helpful.  From the moment we walked up the hostess was sweet and kind.   (Were off to a good start)\nOnce seated our waiter came over and walked us through options and suggestions.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts to start and oh my!  The best!  Even if you don't like brussel sprouts...order them.  They are that good. \nWe followed that up with the Crab risotto & wagyu beef.  Crab risotto was good but that wagyu was excellent!!!\nAnd yes, we had dessert. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and as with the rest  the meal...it didn't disappoint.","4356":"My friends and I came here for our \"nice dinner\" of our girls trip. We did not realize everything was family-style but it worked out! One of our girls is pregnant and our server did a great job answering questions about what dishes she could eat or avoid. We had the trout, which was amazing and the pasta dish. We also had an amazing salad- cannot remember the name but it is first on the menu. We definitely enjoyed our meal and experience!","4357":"My favorite spot in town, hands down. Portions are huge and the service is really good. Recommend going with a large group since it's family style and it's best to get several different things and share.","4358":"I can not say enough about this restaurant!  While I may question how early this place has their hostess stand open, what a fake out, I wouldn't question a single other thing about this culinary gem.  The waitstaff was plentiful, beyond attentive, and so smartly versed in each dish.  We shared 5 dishes and two desserts.  Every bite shined, the layers of flavors and the execution are those of Michelin Star holders I've visited. I wish I knew the name of our server to celebrate him, but it was a team effort.  There is only one thing that will disappoint me about this restaurant: that I live in Arizona and won't be able to visit again and again.","4359":"The food here is good: rich flavors, nothing too adventurous. The ambience is warm. The wine list was a little scattered when I ate here, but whatever. This is the kind of comfortable spot where you could hammer out some key details of an amicable divorce, like who gets the Saarinen table from the pool house.","4360":"Unfortunately fame doesnt make a good cook.  But we tried to see what the name brings, with all the history behind it. \nA salad (where were the fruits ?) too large to eat. Not a exciting tasting of what the menu said, Gouda cheese a mouse couldn't find.  And dinner served when trying to eat that damn salad. \nThe pasta was over cooked and too salty. It was smothered in a lot of sauce like it needed that extra bath to mask the pasta. \n\nI guess a name should do it. But there are options to eat elsewhere for that kind of money. ......\nBusy for the bar and wines. But food wise maybe not.","4361":"We were in town from LA and have heard so many incredible things about Lark, and it lived up to all of it! The food was absolutely beautiful and delicious. Our server Tim was beyond wonderful and his service was impeccable! He really made our dining experience special and memorable. We will definitely be back!! Thank you!!","4362":"Wish I could give it more stars! This place is amazing! We sat at the bar because they were packed but the food and drinks were incredible. The decor is awesome and loved the atmosphere! Definitely recommend!","4363":"Thank you for making our anniversary so special. Food is five stars and the atmosphere thriving.","4364":"This is my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara for a nice dinner. They don't have a lot of vegetarian items on the menu but were able to customize a pasta dish for us that was unbelievable, melt in your mouth, buttery pasta; they probably make it on-site. They also have very good wine, appetizers, and desserts.","4365":"We enjoyed our first visit at the Lark, but it went downhill this time~ what a shame :-(  \n\nOur waiter suggested a glass of $16 pinot noir that was poured in a small chardonnay glass instead of a bigger pinot noir glass!  The scallops dish was presented with chunks of fat pork belly that ruined the beautiful taste of the diver scallops.  \n\nPerhaps their famous sommeliers and chefs were on vacation??","4366":"You know that Flawless song by Beyonc\u00e9 where she goes \"God damn, God damn\", that was my exact reaction to every dish I had at The Lark. From the complimentary popcorn (cinnamon + Sage --are you kidding me? Best flavor combo) to the Grilled Spanish Octopus dish, everything we ordered that night was amazing right after the other. So many unique flavors yet they somehow all work. This place specializes in family style dining which is great if you have a group of friends celebrating a special occasion & want to try everything on the menu. \n\nService was impeccable. Migs (our server) came through that night with all the best suggestions for our first time having dinner at the Lark. He never steered us wrong bc we loved all the dishes. Everyone who works there was so nice and helpful! The Lark definitely knows how to treat their customers & make sure they have an enjoyable experience. From the tiny details like having a birthday postcard for us to  having fleece blankets if you need them while sitting outside. \n\nLove the ambience, love the interior & exterior of the restaurant, the staff, open kitchen, and of course  the free validation on parking. One of the best dinners I've had in awhile where everything went right. Thank you Lark! \n\nHere are the dishes we ordered that night if you're interested knowing. Heads up, they do have seasonal menus so it might not be there when you go.\n\nWest Coast oysters\nHanger steak tartare--comes with a Budweiser which is so extra but I love it\nBrussel sprouts\nJuniper smoked duck breast--comes with a croissant \nGrilled Spanish octopus--MY FAVORITE DISH from the night! Stellar! One of the best octopus meal I've had in my life--so tender and flavorful!","4367":"Lark isn't terrible, but they're also not accomplishing what they've set out to do, which is a shame because it's not cheap. The first thing to know, which is not apparent from their menu, but almost rudely insisted upon by your server, is that all of the dishes are meant to be shared whether you want to or not. This menu structure dictates the main problem with their service: They don't know when to bring anything. Food shows up randomly paired, and then there will be periods of time when nothing at all happens. \n\nWe started with the \"wedge\" salad which was pretty good, but heavy on the bacon and, for some reason, a clump of blue cheese that wasn't integrated into the dish at all. It was a salad, fine, whatever. Our party of four had intended to split two salads, but they insisted upon serving the salads one after the other, which meant we spent a lot of time eating salad. One member of our party just wanted to have some salad and the roasted chicken as an entree, but this was, apparently, not allowed. I've eaten at restaurants like Michael Voltaggio's Ink where they've mastered the succession of dishes so that the meal flows seamlessly and logically from start to finish. The Lark doesn't have this down yet, but they've committed to it anyway. \n\nNext, we received the crispy duck wings and scallops which both suffered from the same problem: Overseasoning. Don't get me wrong, food should be properly and liberally seasoned, but both of these dishes seemed to be composed of random spices and ingredients which were overpowering and unnecessary. A perfectly cooked scallop became a vehicle for a cloying tomato jam on a bed of undercook risotto. The duck wings were slammed with vadouvan to the point where you couldn't even taste the duck. The beef ribs were well cooked, but ultimately suffered from the same seasoning issue. \n\nWondering where the chicken was? Well, so was the member of our party who wanted that as an entree. They forgot to make it. We were told at the outset by our somewhat defensive server, Mel, that the chicken took twenty-five minutes to cook. Fine, whatever. But we are now about ninety minutes into dinner and no chicken. When asked where it was, Mel told us it was being plated. We then waited another twenty minutes while they, presumably, hastily cooked the chicken. By the time it was finely served we were ready to go so they boxed it up and took it off the bill. \n\nIn conclusion, the space is very beautiful and comfortable, but the food is mostly heavy handed and just ok. The service is where they really need a lot of work. Either figure out the sharing plate system or go back to a regular menu, because what they're doing now doesn't work.","4368":"The hot spot in the Funk Zone.  Great quality and presentation and while pricey it is a great vibe.  We shared everything and enjoyed the hipster crowd.  Only drawback is I left my $300 jacket and they did not try very hard to help me locate it the next day.  Had to call several times since they're only open for dinner and did not answer the phone until five.  They are so Busy they didn't seem to care","4369":"Meh. I've had four meals at The Lark. The first three were outstanding. The most recent one was very average. The menu was adventurous bordering on just weird for the sake of being different and the food was no where near as good as it has been in the past. Both the hostess and server had no interpersonal skills. Disappointed. Used to be great. This is a pretty pricy restaurant for this kind of experience.","4370":"Loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. It is very hip and both the interior and exterior areas are beautiful. I really enjoyed sitting outside - the weather was warm and they had heaters. Our server was nice (a little spacey) and the food was good. \n\nWe got the brussels sprouts since all the reviews raved about them. Yep, they were brussels sprouts. Very good, but not anything phenomenal. We shared the scallops with squid ink couscous as well as the bone marrow crusted beef cheeks. Both were delicious - the scallops were well-cooked and the couscous had a great flavor. The beef cheeks were melt-in-your-mouth delicious and absolutely wonderful. It was a shame that the accompaniment (under cooked parsnips) found their way onto the plate. First of all, parsnips are a winter root vegetable - why are they even serving this at the end of May? Second, parsnips are not good when only partially cooked.\n\nDessert was okay - at our servers suggestion, we tried the hazelnut ice cream sandwich with the salted caramel brownie. Not a fan of this - the brownie was overly salty and the ice cream wasn't great. We barely ate it and our server just took it away without asking why.\n\nOverall, we had a very good dinner and I would go back.","4371":"Holy moly! Amazing!! Delicious +  the atmosphere was fabulous. I really \"judge\" a place on atmosphere and The Lark delivered. We got to sit by the fire place outside and the service + music where lovely. \n\nWe had the sun-chocks (WTF?! Amazing)... kale and butternut squash salad (holy moly!) and pork belly w\/cornbread (Bury me in this dish please). \n\nWhat I loved even more than the service and food quality was ..... the fact that they do not rush you out the door! Each dish came individually- not all at once. I felt no pressure for The Lark to move me out of the restaurant ASAP to turn over the table.  This method of \"feeding someone\" made me feel important! No pressure to get out and having the patron enjoy their meal is valued here. It's the little things!! \n\nLovely dinner! The Lark was my suggestion so it made me look good! Hence- I'll be back!!\n\nFarm fresh food \nValet parking + street parking \nMusic\nAtmosphere\nAmazing food\nGreat for a birthday\/special dinner too","4372":"Wow, I had read reviews but didn't expect everything to be as good as it was!! \n\nAppetizer: seared scallops\nMains: pappardelle and rib eye for 2 \n\nDelicious! We are still dreaming of that pappardelle.  The mushrooms and asparagus went perfectly with the creamy sauce (which I wanted to drink it was that damn good!) \nThe rib eye for two was also simply delicious. It too came with a sauce and some amazing grilled corn, wowza! This dish has BBQ at its finest with the baked beans on the side. It truest is a dish for two as we couldn't finish it but it made for great leftovers. \nThe scallop appetizer can be a dish on its own but a good shared app for two. This dish was very refreshing with all the veggies and herbs. Highly suggest this as it helped open our appetite for more!\n\nService was great, cocktails were awesome! Can't wait to go back!","4373":"What fun mix of flavors!\nThey switch up the menu frequently so it's refreshing to always have something new to try. The plates are meant to share, which we love! The mixed\/craft drinks are always in point and the wine list is robust. \nThe outdoor patio has a ton of heaters so you'll always be nice and cozy on a cold night.","4374":"The Lark's name is so fitting. Truly a flight of fancy. The playful food presentations, which are as sumptuous as they are beautiful, beg to be shared in this social, lively atmosphere. The food is arguably some of the best in town, marked by creativity and fine notes of freshness. Flit from communal bench seating to the bar to make new friends and watch people as you dine, or catch a seat outside for a more subdued experience. The atmosphere is sophisticated without being stuffy, striking a balance between just alluring enough, just exciting enough, and just social enough for your Friday or Saturday night go-to hot spot.","4375":"The Emperor has no clothes!  -- This is my second visit to The Lark.  The first was so unsatisfactory that I withheld judgment until a return trip.  Last night's visit confirmed to me that this venue is overpriced, overrated, and just plain bad.  And oh so pretentious. Portions are small and, in some cases, completely inedible.  Case in point:  My companion and I actually sent the charcuterie platter back.  It consisted of a jar of spam, a basket of burnt bread and three fatty slabs of (who knows what), and a bunch of gristle. Despite this mess, the wait staff -- with the straight face -- described it all with enthusiasm in an effort to cover-up the fact that it is what it is:  Disguisting.  As for the balance of the meal - devilled eggs, strawberry and beet salad, shrimp, and deconstructed desserts -- you gotta be kidding me.  Yet, people are lining up for this stuff?  Criticism may seem  petty, but nowhere worth the price.  Bottomline:  The dictionary defines a \"lark\" as a prankish sort of mischief.  That describes this place perfectly, only the joke is on all of us.  People are destined to figure it out soon.  If this place is in business at this time next year, I'll be amazed.","4376":"Everything about this place is excellent. Food was delicious and refreshingly different.  Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. Would deserve 5 stars if the portions were larger. Pricey for what was delivered. There were 8 of us, bill was large, but no one left full. With that being said, it is definitely worth a visit.","4377":"I've visited the Lark several times this year, and the ever revolving seasonal menu is definitely a highlight, but my favorite dishes end up being the appetizers.\n\nWe started off with the West Coast Oysters on the Half Shell. You would never expect granny smith apple granita on oysters.. but they work! The acidity from the granny smith really cut through, and the caviar brought back that salty ocean flavor. Really delicious.\n\nNext up was the Southern Pimento Cheese Toast. What. Is. This. Cheese. Toast. The smoked gouda and aged provolone coupled with the sourdough just brought the word savory to another level. Flavor was incredibly rich and voluptuous. The pickled serrano chilies could have brought even more out of this dish, but there wasn't enough, and the flavor got washed over by the savoriness of the rest of the dish. Still great as it came right after the oysters, but I don't think I could have enjoyed this as much if it came after another dish with rich flavors.\n\nOur server hooked us with trying out the Roasted Beet Carpaccio. I had no idea this was even a thing, but clearly it is, and it's delicious. I don't even normally like beets, and this was good. You'd be amazed at what kind of flavors the sweet marinated asian pear brings out of the beets. The buttermilk-thyme panna cotta brought a great creaminess, and the dish was just beautiful to look at. I do wish there was more pear and puffed barley crisp on the dish. The barley crisp was absolutely crucial for texture, and three pieces was just not enough.\n\nNext up was our meat dish, and we got the Slow Roasted Niman Ranch Ribs. Ribs were honestly my least liked dish out of the 5 that we had. Ribs weren't quite dry... but was definitely not as juicy as I wished they were. Flavors were on point, but the doneness of the meat was a bit of a letdown.\n\nWe finished off our night with the Caramelized East Coast Diver Scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly, tender and just melted away in your mouth. The rest of the dish and the garnish, unfortunately didn't bring anything special. I wish there was more pop to the dish, but it seemed like they held back on the flavors a little too much to avoid overshadowing the scallops. I wish there was more of the fresno chile sambal to bring in some more life.\n\nStaff is welcoming and friendly each time, and I love the creativity and the seasonality in the menu, but definitely wish there were improvements in execution. All five dishes and a couple beers came out to around $150 which isn't extravagant, but I think the execution left something to be desired for the price.","4378":"We have dinner at The Lark whenever we have friends visiting from town, it is such a wonderful ambiance and we love the food. We had dinner there yesterday and as usual it was amazing. We only wished they had spaced the dishes out a little bit, we felt very rushed to the point of being annoyed. We could not really  savor and enjoy the food, without the waitress coming with the next dish and trying to take the previous plate away before we had finished it!  We told them that we felt rushed and asked them to slow it down a bit. Really too bad,  but I am still giving  4 stars because I love the food and the place so much! The only dish that was not unbelievably amazing was the chickpea tagine, which seemed overspiced and otherwise a little boring. The brussel sprouts are killer, the new red squash dish really really good and the chicken was amazing! Wished we had had more time to savor everything.","4379":"This restaurant is fantastic.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts are a must-try.\n\nWe ordered 4 entrees to split amongst a group; everyone loved every single item served.\n\nThe drinks are very nicely mixed. Great cocktail list.\n\nWould absolutely go back.","4380":"Had a wonderful anniversary dinner. Started with the brussels sprouts, which may have been the best I've ever had. Scallops were tasty, and came with a delicious polenta. Last was the steak, and it too was cooked perfectly. Definitely make a reservation. I can't wait to go back.","4381":"Sweet restaurant in the wine crawl district of Santa Barbara. Like most of Santa barbara, the parking is awful so they already get bonus points for providing free valet parking.\n\nBest visited on a warm evening when you can sit at the outdoor tables, by the fires. \n\nThere are a number of tables inside as well as a communal table if you don't have a reservation.\n\nThe first thing we had was a waitress who asked if it was our first time at the restaurant, which we affirmed. \n\nThen she proceeded to explain that one side of the menu had food and the other had drink. And waited to see if we understood.\n\nWTF? Maybe she thought this was the first time we'd been to A restaurant. A couple of other interesting incidents; the explanation that the smoked salmon would be thinly sliced not like a steak, and when asking for a glass of Vouvray (rarely offered but much appreciated), was given a glass of Vouvray champagne, which is only offered by the bottle. I do appreciate that they would break a bottle for me, on request, but what a waste.\n\nIt's a fun looking menu with some interesting hits and some adventurous misses and mostly based on assembly as opposed to alchemy. It goes from smaler to larger dishes, according to the waitress and, lo, she was right.\n\nInstead of bread, we were given a 14 spice laden popcorn which tasted like chili popcorn. Nothing as complicated as advertised but nice.\n\nStarted with the beets and burrata which ended up tasting like beets. And burrata. The most intersting there was the use of hibiscus vinaigrette as a little side sauce.\n\nThe pork belly which came with well chosen peaches and a backstory (cooked for 30 hours in a nun's smoker or some other such tripe) was a more enjoyable course.\n\nWe then had the pastrami cured salmon with apples and a wonderful brioche. The octopus with peanuts and couscous was also lovely, but there is  feeling that the chef is trying all sorts of weird combinations so he can be \"the one\" who finds a patented dish.\n\n You may have heard of the snails and porridge \"invented\" by Blumenthal. I've tried it and it's about as essential to eat as cardboard. The bone marrow with buttermilk biscuits and marmalade is an obvious attempt at this. If googling it, you can find no other reference to this anywhere. \n\nEnded with a clean pavlova which was one of the more classic based dishes.\n\nThe service here was some of the best ever. Servers who have been fed everything on the menu, gives informed advice to one's choosing. They also work as a team, with waiters really helping each other out beautifully.\n\nA good, interesting venue. And the best thing? Free valet parking.","4382":"Where to begin. There are so many problems with this restaurant. Despite the high reviews, RUN from this place. \n\nGood: valet was quick and courteous.\n\nBad: server never to be found after taking our order. Requested bread from 3 other servers, never came until the 3rd request. Prices very high for quality and portion. Food was undercooked despite asking for medium dropped off by a runner frank rare, with no opportunity to comment. Sending back for my pregnant wife took forever, and then plate was simply put in broiler. No apology by server until check delivered. Demi glace tasted like flour, dish undersalted and no salt on table. Ambiance extremely loud, in no small part to the group of fast new drinking buddies two people down. Of note the server was quick to bring them more drinks more than once.","4383":"I've been to the Lark before and had a great time when it was with friends. I work on Anacapa street at one of the tasting rooms and recommended it regularly until two weeks ago when I went for a date night with my husband. It was a Sunday night and very slow. There were 4 tables available that were 4 tops and they refused to seat us at our own table since we only had a party of 2. We were forced to sit at the communal table where we had no privacy and another couple kept making small talk with us. It was extremely annoying to see that the tables were NEVER sat the entire meal. I can understand upholding this policy on a busy night but this was straight terrible customer service! I'll never recommend this restaurant to any wine club members or tourists again.","4384":"enjoyable atmosphere, good service from the hostess to the valet.  Food was good, but not amazing.  the drinks were really good.  two of the dishes were ok, one very good (roast chicken).  Gnocchi was really over salted.  Crudo, vegetables were cut really large and didn't seem like other crudos I've had.  A bit expensive for the food.  Would be nice if there was a place to sit or before they call your reservation.  The bar was totally full so had to stand in the walkway until our table was ready.","4385":"Great ambiance, our server was great. I had the the pomegranate mocktail which was bomb! My hubby and I ordered the cheese plate and the burrata salad to start us off. The cheese plate was pretty good but the salad was a little too bitter for both our taste. As for our main, he ordered the scallops which were delicious and I got the 1\/2 chicken which is bigger than expected and I definitely recommend it. For dessert we got the seasonal pumpkin balls (don't remember the name) but it was decent. Overall, cool experience and great food.","4386":"Fine dining without the stuffiness! Portions were actually relatively small, especially if you're big eaters like my husband and I. But you can't beat the flavors and presentation. We ordered 3 plates for two and were very satisfied. All 3 dishes offered something unique.\nOur service was excellent and the overall experience was awesome. Totally recommend!","4387":"Disclaimer, only had 2 appetizers and 3 cocktails at the bar. Ordered the cheese board and salmon rillette. Cheese board came out with only one type of cheese. We had to ask what kind of cheese it was and after the bartender went to ask (I'd expect him to know), we were told it was Manchego. Definitely not Manchego. Found it odd that the bartender would make it up. Rillette was great and smoky. Old fashioned was like any other that I'd had before. Popcorn was overly sweet and would have been better as a desert. Could have been my pallet after some wine but overall we were not impressed.","4388":"I have eaten here 3 times. First time Woohoo, second time ''Yay'', third time A-OK. Just depends on what you order and who is paying.   It is fun to share a bunch of dishes if your friends don't order  Pork Belly or Octopus.","4389":"I loved restaurant atmosphere and layout of dining area. They have plenty selections of wines and food but their food wasn't for me...\n\nThe price point is pretty high, I don't mind to spend bit more when I'm on vacation but honestly It wasn't worth to spend $180 for two people.\n\nService was okay, food was good but overpriced (for me), so guess they deserve three stars","4390":"Came here for drinks and appetizers before our dinner reservation and absolutely loved it! Drinks we ordered were the Red Hook and Old Aztec and both were fantastic if you're a bourbon drinker. \n\nFor apps, we ordered the olives and pimento cheese. Both were great, but I have to say the pimento cheese is a must order! Loved this place so much, we almost cancelled our dinner reservation to stay here-- definitely coming back to SB just for this place!","4391":"came her for New Year's and I can say it was nothing special. Especially considering how outrageous the prices were for the meals offered. Maybe other nights differ but I wasn't too satisfied.","4392":"Had a wonderful meal here last night -- what an awesome addition to the SB food scene & Funk Zone. We started with the cheese platter, which was yummy, and they happily brought out some extra crostini when we ran out. I had two glasses of an awesome local Cab (Notary Public in Santa Ynez) that I am now obsessed about. We also had a burrata & beets salad (delicious & fresh), the pork belly & the hangar steak. Everything was creative & delicious with great presentation. Service was nice as well & I'm excited to return!","4393":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! From the moment we walked in, the place had an upbeat vibe. The service was wonderful. The food was some of the best I've had!! They start you off with popcorn that's made with green onions, bbq seasonings, and garlic-- so tasty! The dishes are all designed to share and are flavorful, inventive, creative, and damn good! The actual presentation of the food is stunning as well. Plan to be here for awhile do that you can enjoy the entire experience! The brussel sprout starter, shirt rib dish, and honey chicken platter were all amazing. We had way too much food for two people. The portions are huge!! Overall this was an amazing experience and we hope to return in the future!","4394":"For the price, it was the best gourmet  meal I've ever had! I came here for my birthday and it was just delicious. The beets and butternut squash dish was my favorite of all the dishes I had. Everything was presented in a neat way and was visually stunning. The habanero trout was a bit too spicy, but I still enjoyed it. \n\nThe waiter made a great point, which was to stick to the dishes you can't make at home. This was great advice.","4395":"Delicious food\nGreat service \nAwesome ambiance \nConvenient location... close to state street","4396":"Highly recommend!! Delicious food and very knowledgable waiters. The Brussels sprouts are to die for! I haven't tried anything I don't like from the Lark. The popcorn they bring to the table when you arrive is scrumptious-I wanted to take some home but unfortunately they don't sell it & they don't give it away. YOU NEED TO SELL THE POPCORN LARK! The ambience is quite stunning-this is by far my favorite special occasion restaurant in SB! The only draw back was the hostess the last time I took a friend for her birthday. She was rude and acted as if she owned the place. Strange that they would have someone like that at the front greeting the guests. Everyone else was exceptional!!","4397":"The Brussels and sun chokes were very oily and not very tasty. Our branzino came out cold and we waited quite a while. The table, who arrived after us, that was behind us was served a steaming hot branzino.","4398":"Upon arriving, the restaurant is huge! Really cute decor.\n\nFood = Bomb. Food is really good here. Prices are high, much like LA restaurants. I was disappointed in their service though, so I'm going to knock off a star. I tried to make reservations, they said they were full. When we arrived we decided to just sit at the bar. BUT I saw at least two tables that were empty the entire time we were there... \n\nMy Paloma was good but it was also $14. I think that is the most expensive Paloma I have ever had. We started off with 1\/2 cheese board. It was excellent, had brie, blue cheese, and goat cheese. Really enjoyed all of that. Then I had the secret burger because I was craving a burger. My boyfriend got the lamb belly. All of our dishes were delicious. Excellent dining choice if you're in Santa Barbara.","4399":"Stopped in after a day of wine tasting in Santa Ynez.   I was looking forward to continuing our wine adventure with other local wines from the area.  For a restaurant claiming to focus on local food and wine their wine list was quite disappointing.  Not a very good selection of wines from Santa Barbara or Central Coast which both have amazing wines.  Also the beer selection was from all over the place with very little local (Firestone\/Fig Mountain?).  Food was also ordinary, overpriced and mediocre. \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it is cool looking and a nice addition to the Funk Zone.  I don't understand all the high reviews.  Maybe SB was dying for something new and fresh and the The Lark was the best they got.  I know they are trying to be fine dining but any of the hundreds of Gastropubs in LA are far better (Westside Tavern, Father's Office, Public School, Library Bar) at far better prices and beer and wine selections.","4400":"We were recommended this place by a local Uber driver. We made the reservation.... Food is too salty and overcooked. We ordered lamb dish and brussel sprouts, both of this dishes were supper salty and burned. Very mediocre food. I do not recommend this place. In addition, my friend just said, this place is overpriced and not worst the money","4401":"The best restaurant in SB!  The food and drinks are creative, and the service is on point. It's hard to compare it with the other restaurants in town because it's more like a cool restaurant in NYC or London.","4402":"I wish there was an option for ZERO stars. First of all, I have never written a Yelp review in my life but I would feel terrible to not warn people about this place. If you want to feel like a second class citizen or a peasant come to The Lark! Greeted kindly by the hostess, then we sat at the bar and was greeted coldly with a snooty bar staff. When we couldn't decide what we wanted Ben the stuck up bartender asked us in a rude manner to scoot down to make more room for others! Then he went and whispered something to the bar back and other bartenders and the all began to laugh like a bunch of high school children. It made us so uncomfortable that my party began to walk out one by one! I felt so embarrassed and never treated like this ANYWHERE in my life! It ruined my last day in Santa Barbara. The manager ran out to apologize and offered a round of cocktails on the house. This was a kind gesture, but I will say I will never go back to The Lark even if someone paid me to. Save your money and time and go somewhere else, Anywhere else! I have experienced better customer service at Taco Bell, sad to say.","4403":"So delish!  I did not have one bad dish here -- even ordered a kale dish and my parents, who normally hate kale, loved it.  The oysters were great, the burrata was great, I really don't think anything sucks here.  And the drinks were amazing too.  I think my favorite was the El Jefe.  \n\nEverything here was so inventive, down to the homemade seasoned popcorn they give you in place of bread.  That stuff was addictive.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation.  We were there on a Sunday and the place was PACKED by 8 pm.","4404":"I felt like a lark singing a fine tune while eating my meal. Each course was delicious. The herbs, spices and sauces\n were out of the ordinary and sumptuous. We had the chicken , steak , and branzino. Each one was simply delicious.  And the best of all were the Brussels sprouts. The desserts were totally unique and tasty","4405":"Had a really poor experience - we had called about 2 hours in advance to ask if we could push back our reservation by about 45 mins. The hostess said that would be fine as long as we left the table by a certain time. When we arrived, the hostess on site was gruff and said that our table was no longer available and that we would have to wait for another 45 mins. There was no acknowledgment that they messed up or any effort to apologize or even some graciousness to ask us to grab a drink while we wait for the next available table. Am sure the food is amazing but the service just ruined it.","4406":"A group of 10 girls came for a bachelorette dinner and it couldn't have been more amazing! They made place cards with our menu on it for each of us. A perfect touch which the bride loved! Everything we ordered was amazing but the brussel sprouts won us all over. We had 3 orders because they were THAT GOOD! Such a beautiful restaurant with great service. A night we will never forget!","4407":"Everything are good\uff01food is delicious and servers are always friendly. Duck Breast is a bit heavy\uff0cothers are perfect\uff01Fried Oyster and sprouts are so\n Yummy!","4408":"Idk about this place. For the price it was okay. Made a reservation and had no problem changing it. Turns out it wasn't busy at all on a Saturday night. I guess we went late (8pm)? Anyways the food was a little disappointing. Ordered the hamachi crudo, Australian wagyu bavette, and the cauliflower. My favorite was the cauliflower it basically tastes like well roasted cauliflower with A1 sauce. \nThe hamachi crudo was pretty disappointing. The hamachi was pretty fresh but the melon and the daikon was overpowering the hamachi. The avocado sauce was ok. Nothing special and pretty bland. \nThe Australian wagyu was good but I would never order that again for that price. \nGot the blueberry crumble but it was a bit too tart for us. Not enough crumble or crust. Ended up with lots of blueberry. \nIn their defense I think my expectations were too high. Every time the food was served the person who brought just the food keep saying, \"soooooo good sooooo good you're going to love it\" \nThe tea was very good. (rishi never disappoints)\nServer was kind but hard to get a hold of.\nThe seats were a bit weird in the sense that the wall side (bench side?) was much higher than the chair side. \nAmbiance is pretty nice. Good place for girls to get together and talk but I wouldn't come back with my boyfriend. It's nice and romantic but the food is meh. \nOmg they had some kind of free lemon poppy popcorn. Best I've had 2 stars for that. Seriously so good but I heard it changes.","4409":"Had a great dinner here. Reservations for larger group (over 4) are a little hard to get, as in not possible. Plan ahead. In the end I just made a reservation for 4 (which was abundant) and showed up with 5. They were great and accommodated us. I don't say this a \"tip\" but more to point out the one and only con of the whole experience. Food was good, careful and creative. Vegetarians were accommodated with grace. Our service was top notch. We closed the place down but never felt rushed. The good reviews were spot on. I didn't encounter the weaknesses of the bad reviewers. Probably the trendiest restaurant in the Funk Zone. Fun scene at night.","4410":"Amazing service and amazing food. Great atmosphere with beautiful patio seating. Had the burger from the bar. One of the best I've had. Must visit.","4411":"My mouth waters writing this. It is so unbelieveably creative and delicious. The waiters know what they are doing, they know the food and they seem to know what you want, instantly. We four adults cannot wait to go there again. It was a fabulous experience. Linda","4412":"My husband and I had early dinner reservations here on Saturday night and overall we enjoyed it.  It's a cool space with quirky, artsy decor and a surprisingly large number of tables both inside and out.  The service was attentive and well-paced.\n\nHere's what we liked--roasted broccolini, grilled branzino, stone fruit pavlova.  All were delicious and had unique twists.  We'd definitely order those dishes again.\n\nWe also ordered the herb crusted bone marrow.  For me, something about the biscuits it came with was bitter and off-putting so it kind of ruined the dish for me.  I also thought the combo of the bone marrow with the biscuit was too rich.  My husband liked it though.\n\nThe Lark dishes sometimes suffer from putting too much on the plate.  Unfortunately, there were parts of each dish that just weren't necessary and even detracted from the dish at times.  For example, the branzino was perfectly cooked, the sauce was delicious, and the crispy meyer lemon was a revelation.  But the chickpeas, artichokes, and fennel didn't add anything to the dish.  The artichokes were actually kind of tasteless and while I like fennel I didn't enjoy it in this dish. \n\nBut that being said, overall we had a nice dinner and we would come here again.","4413":"I have loved the Lark, having enjoyed several wonderful evenings there.  Last night the only thing good was the popcorn.  We ordered a few appetizers that were just ok, except for the brussel sprouts.  The 2nd course just ok the platter of lamb ribs...awful, cold and over thought, the meat was overwhelmed with all the stuff on it.  The red wine was warm, the servers were drone-like, except for the friendly waitress. We took an out of town friend who is a billy goat, he'll eat anything and we were embarrassed after the way we talked it up.  Has something changed???  The atmosphere is so nice and we want to go back, just want to give some constructive feedback.  Sorry!","4414":"The Lark was an excellent experience. The ambience of the restaurant was very warm and inviting. We sat outside and had dinner by one of fire pits. The weather was on the cool side but with the heaters and fire pit, it made it very nice and cozy. We had the ribs which were amazing. They do have a little kick to them so if you like spicy food this is a great dish. Also had the Brussel sprouts and scallops.  I forgot our servers name but she knew the menu very well and describe the food in detail. She was very nice and you could tell she loved her job and what she did. Great employees like this make for a great experience. Thank you. I would definitely come back.","4415":"A true highlight of our trip to Santa Barbara. The clams and Wagyu were fantastic. Burrata was outstanding. Would not recommend the pork rillette or chocolate cake though. Great wine selection for those looking to drink local and a bit beyond. Charming setting- efficient service. A lovely evening here.","4416":"Over sold the food by the servers.   It was ok, more tapas to share type place.   Not so generous portions.   Servers are trained to sell and they go way over the top to do so.   Almost fake.","4417":"The good:\nAwesome location. Beautiful venue. Great wines and cocktails. Good meat options!\n\nThe bad:\nIf you're a vegetarian there is virtually nothing on the menu you can eat. Vegan? FORGET ABOUT IT. They made me a special dish and it was honestly one of the worst meals I've ever tried. I asked them instead to bring me just a place of sauteed veggies - which they did - and they were far more acceptable than the original attempt at a veg entree. However, with 1\/5 of us Californians being vegetarian you think they'd offer something a bit better, especially for those of us who have carnivorous significant others\/friends who want to dine at the Lark...","4418":"Their brussell sprouts are out of this world.   Delicately crisped, then drizzled with light sauce full of umami, and accented with slices of small cherries.  This restaurant has a way of transforming dishes ubiquitous to this area (uni, pork belly, octopus) and transforming them in to something marvelous.  Highly recommend dining here.","4419":"The Lark is a beautiful restaurant that has a cool vibe. It is located in the art scene of SB known as the \"funk zone\" near the wharf. But if you are vegan forget it. They have nothing on the menu for you and no vegetarian main dishes. It is a sharing menu and if you eat meat or fish it's AMAZING. But if you don't you may go away a little hungry or have to order too many small dishes which add up $$$. It's kinda shocking given that it's a farm to table restaurant in Cali. The food was terrific though. We ate several fish dishes and two \"snacks\" without meat. It was terrific food. And the drinks were awesome. Service was exceptional.","4420":"We went for my bday and it was amazing. The staff and food were great! Highly recommend!","4421":"The area around The Lark is very walkable and fun. We made reservations and our table was immediately available. Our waiter, Jane, was very efficient and accurate - but she was covering too many tables. She pulled it off, but I don't know how. We received one wrong dish which she removed with a numerous phrase and all was well again. The food overall was good (not as good as the other reviews). The Texas redfish was possibly\/probably true gulf red drum but not a very good portion and smothered in 100x too much spice. I would not order that again. \n\nOur table was too close to our neighbor. Thankfully we were on the end of a row so no one was on our other side. That would have made it like a high school cafeteria. And like a cafeteria, the noise level made it impossible to talk\/hear without shouting like everyone else. This was a Tuesday night. I would look elsewhere unless you have young ears, nothing personal to say out loud, and a strong stomach.","4422":"Saw that this place had good reviews so decided to check it out during our weekend trip to Santa Barbara. The ambiance was great, I loved the decor. It was only two of us dining but it looked like it would be a great place for big groups. They gave us a sage\/brown sugar popcorn to start which was delicious. We ordered the Brussel sprouts, scallops and tagliatelle as our main. The food was delicious. Portions are a bit small, but we didn't leave feeling hungry. I would definitely eat here again!","4423":"A good place to go with your good friends or family for chat, drinking, eating.","4424":"My son had a blast there on his 14th birthday, he loves their devil eggs and crispy Brussels sprouts, and his dessert was complimentary from the manager.","4425":"Mouth watering deliciousness!!!!  Amazing food.  This place is extremely unique - cool decorations, cool building.  Our favs - the cheese board, THE MARINATED & GRILLED HANGER STEAK!  Wow!!!!!  Keep it going!  We would have licked the plate but it's not considered polite table manners.  Gnocchi was very tasty as well, unique spicy flavors.  Yum yum good!  This restaurant is a must try, definitely he Hanger Steak!  service was great, friendly and helpful!","4426":"Oh my God what a great place \nNot sure we're to start \nReally smart, eclectic, and rustic decor \nStaff in top shape with attention to detail \nService is swift and very pleasant \nWine list is a hit - don't be afraid to be creative \nWhat else?\nOh the food \nThe best!!!!!\nFresh, interesting, creative \nSmall plates and big plates \nShare and enjoy as many items as you can \nWow what a great place","4427":"Love the atmosphere, great customer service. We had the crispy brussel sprouts but wasn't really crispy. The complimentary popcorn was awesome.","4428":"We wanted to dine at someplace really special to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and again The Lark provided the perfect setting for us...and this time our son Joseph drove up from L.A. to share the experience with us.  Chef Jason offered an almost entirely new menu this time, and the new dishes were wonderful.  We started off with Pisco Sours at the bar (closest we have found to the taste in Peru).  Then a series of exceptional taste and flavor combinations that no other Chef puts together in the same way.  We call this place \"foodie heaven\".  Great service matched the great food.  Check out the photos to see the dishes we tried.  As with every previous visit of ours, Chef Jason even took a few moments from his wildly busy open kitchen to come out to say \"hi\", take a photo with us, and to sincerely ask us for feedback.  If you're a foodie driving past Santa Barbara one way or the other, plan a meal at The Lark...you won't be disappointed!","4429":"Service was okay. They call their service family style when they just put your order in the middle of the table one after the other. The selection of wine was fine. Free popcorn while waiting for our table by the bar. My first time to pair wine with popcorn. Menu for May wasn't that bad or good. Had a platter of cheese. Serving portions is quite small to be called a platter. Scallops with pur\u00e9ed greens was too salty for my palette. The lamb was cooked a bit too much resulting a burnt and bitter taste of the saffron. The hamachi was okay. Some food pairing in their menu is out of the ordinary.","4430":"Ok I just read reviews (should've read before like we usually do but went here on friend's recommendation) and really can't be bothered to ask if we want bread?  I guess I'm still annoyed with the service. It took a while for our server to take our order but our drinks and first two dishes came out pretty quickly. Arugula pear salad (very good) and the salmon rillette (the chips were good texture but a tad too salty and I personally didn't like it with the salmon, the hubs thought it was ok). But then after waiting over 30 mins for our last dish (branzino) and we had to get going soon, we flagged our server and she said it'll be a couple of minutes. A bus person actually came by to take our plates because he thought we were done! (We told him we still had a dish coming...). Another 10 min and we asked if we can cancel that dish. Another 10 min they do (no apology or explanation for the delay of last course) but then the branzino is done!  So they packed it up to go for us. So the stars are for the branzino that was actually pretty good, they still gave it to us after taking it off the bill, and they are super dog friendly.","4431":"Completely overrated. I read all these reviews and had a great expectations but was disappointed with each course. Ordered the ribs which sounded good. Asked the waitress how many they came with and was told it was a half rack. Food comes out and it was 4 ribs for over $30?? Not worth it. Wine pour was exceptionally small. Will not be back.","4432":"Would have been 5 stars if the chef hadn't added cayenne pepper to the crab risotto. Diner beware!","4433":"Hands down, the worst dining experience that we have ever encountered. And to think, in the heart of Santa Barbara. Don't let the ratings fool you, service here was worst. We came 15 minutes early and got seated at the communal counter and was told we would get a dinner menu and would be seated at 5pm.  As heavily staffed as they were on the front of the house, they seemed too busy talking to each other and we ended up getting left out of the picture.  Of course, we never got a dinner menu and we never got seated for dinner.  And when the food started coming out,  everything was bland.  You would think that you were at a dietary restaurant.  The only thing that my daughter liked was the popcorn. I could've went to a movie theater, if that was the case. Follow up by the manager on duty was even worse.  He seemed clueless how to handle situations where service fails.  Quite sad to see this kind of service in the heart of Santa Barbara.   Service is everything!  Even if the food is spot on, bad service can ruin everything.  Avoid this place.","4434":"Best food I've had in a really long time. Order the bone marrow with the orange zest spread. Yummy!!!","4435":"I very interesting menu in an eclectic location. Make sure you call to get a reservation or you won't get in. Appetizers are worth a try.","4436":"Great atmosphere, we sat outside and while it got chilly, we were very comfortable. Service is excellent, attentive and friendly. We were celebrating an anniversary and they brought us complementary sparkling Ros\u00e9'. \n\nTry the pimento sliders, the okra is a fun touch. I had the branzino, it was perfectly prepared, crispy skin and delicate meat. \n\nFoodies will enjoy the unique flavor combinations. The less adventurous eaters may struggle to find an entree they are comfortable ordering.","4437":"It is a great place where deserves a 3.5 star (4\/4\/2015), not a four star because: its okay service, the layout of the restaurant which makes it hard for staff to look over and understand which tables need immediate attention and\/or service, and run out of some dishes despite of their non-wide menu. After all, we ordered charcuterie board, oysters, porchetta, and roasted chicken. The roasted chicken was gorgeous, crispy outside and moist inside, yet the mashed potato was too much. Over all, it is not as impressive as how people describe about them, but they definitely serve good food.","4438":"Great atmosphere, good service, really unique dishes with unusual ingredients. Unfortunately I didn't like the taste of any of the dishes we ordered.  The ribs were absolutely foul. In hindsight the waiter tried to subtly warn me off of them. Couldn't even eat a bite they were so weird. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough for the menu.","4439":"My family came to the Lark for Mother's Day Breakfast and all were looking forward to having a delicious meal. Unfortunately, the experience left much to be desired...\n\nSpecifically, our waitress did everything she could to avoid eye contact with anybody that needed something in our area. For example, if you wanted to get her attention that you were ready to order, she would see that you needed something from her and immediately avert her eyes.\n\nI watched this happen to several other diners too and eventually saw that folks were getting up to walk over to her to ask for their check and to place their orders.\n \nWhat a disappointing way to spend a holiday breakfast, following the waitress around on foot in order to get a refill, to place an order, and to get the bill. The food was good, but honestly not worth all the walking and the experience was overshadowed by their staff's buffoonery. \nWhat a disappointment.","4440":"The lark had very imaginative cuisine (but very small portions) and decent service. I was not thrilled with the concept that we were supposed to share everything. When I looked at the menu online I did not look close enough to see this or I probably would not have booked us there for dinner. There were six of us total, two were vegetarians, and very slim pickings for vegans, though they had a couple dishes I liked. The server said they could veganize the dishes for us which was nice, but as a vegan I prefer to eat a dish that was actually designed to be vegan, there is a big difference as ingredients that are intended to go in the dish were left out. Still, I thought the flavor of each dish was good. The concept of sharing means that they can bring out a dish when it is ready and not have to be concerned with timing dishes for each guest. It's really very clever from their point of view, but I didn't really like that idea much. It was pretty noisy and crowded which is to be expected at a trendy spot. I could not imagine that someone would consider it romantic with the level of noise... unless maybe sitting outside on the patio is quieter. We were inside.  I don't think I would go back there, and my other friends thought the same thing. But maybe it's just not our kind of place. If you want to drink and share plates it's fine.","4441":"Holy moly, I love the family style servings here! The duck wings were very unique, tender, and sweet  Also, I definitely recommend the Japanese eggplant because you get a blast of sweet flavors. We also got the pappardelle, which I don't recommend. The sauce was creamy and rich, but the noodles had a poor texture.","4442":"Used to be a 5 star but this place has changed. Our server, Desiree, was pushing us to leave from the get go. We felt the minute we sat they were ready for us to leave. \"Hurry up and order because the kitchen will take a while, order the bone marrow, what do you want to order.\" \nUh no, we'd like to look at the menu, order appetizers and decide on our main dish. \nThe short ribs came out and weren't short ribs at all. We had ordered them before and knew what they looked like. Desiree explained that they change the menu frequently but it clearly wasn't what we ordered and no explanation or consideration was made. Definitely NOT worth the $400+ bill.","4443":"The Lark was absolutely amazing.  We had our reception dinner here after our wedding at the SB courthouse.  We had some very intense critics in our group - frenchmen that were previous chefs and have an eye for great food and ambiance. \n\nEveryone (including the frenchmen) loved the meal.  The lark made it extra special with pre printed menus that they matched with our colors.  They were seamless to work with.  Vienna and Sienna were amazing at coordinating the event.  The wait staff were impressive.  They constantly had our drinks filled and they were attentive to everyone. \n\nI couldn't have asked for a better wedding reception.  We were in the private Pullman room and we were able to have the most intimate wedding thanks to the Lark.  Thank you for the class A service and the exceptional food!","4444":"Simply amazing and so delicious. Everything we tried was great. The environment was lovely and our server was superb. Can't wait to go back. It's worth the 1.5hr drive from Los Angeles :)","4445":"One of the best meals ever. Fabulous setting, we were with our toddler and they catered to our special evening out while visiting Santa Barbara. Highly recommend.","4446":"I love this place! Food is amazing and staff is friendly. Hubby and I got the brussel sprouts appetizer, pear salad, and chicken platter. Brussel sprouts were sooo delicious! Pear salad was fresh and chicken was very flavorful.  Taste buds enjoy themselves every time I'm here :)","4447":"So this place made top 10 must eats in Santa Barbara. I believe that list should be revised. I'll start with the positives; knowledgeable and friendly staff, fresh local ingredients, generous appetizers, and good drinks.\n\nAlas, the negatives outweigh positives. Salt and sweetness are being overused. It's the first time I had brussel sprouts smothered in sweet sauce which just totally killed the flavor for me. Leave them savory, sometimes Simplicity works much better. We could not finish the plate and had to rely on free popcorn to cleanse the palate; perhaps that's the reason they serve it. In addition, leaving them in the trunk for an hour gave birth to the most horrible smell I have yet experienced. I really thought I would need detailing afterwards and had flashback of that Seinfeld episode. \n\nI did enjoy the salads and was curious enough to try the $50 prime rib dish. Although the dish was good and creative I can't say it was shareable unless you fill up an appetizers prior. It just left me feeling underwhelmed and prices are not worth the attempt at creativity and the quality of the meal. \n\nThe Lark may serve better as I happy hour with shareable appetizers among a large group. But this is not a dining experience.","4448":"I really wanted to love this place after all the great reviews we read. We would definitely give the ambience a 5 star. I ordered the green goddess cocktail, which I enjoyed. The reason for the 3 stars is the food. We started with the cheese board - for $16-$18 cheese board, I would have expected to have two or three different cheeses, instead we only got one with kiwis. The pork belly was extremely salty so we were glad that we ordered the risotto to try to balance out the salt. Risotto was just OK and the chicken fried oysters sounded amazing, but again, overly salty.","4449":"Wowwwww just went here again last night for a private event and the food was TO DIE FOR. \nPinot noir: Grade A\nHamachi: A\nGoat cheese with strawberries and black sesame granola: A\nWild arugula and peaches: A\nGrilled CA asparagus w\/ burrata: A+ \nSpring orecchiette pasta: A. Unique and tasty!\nRoasted Ocean Trout: A+ WOWOWOWOW\nI don't eat meat, but had the brown butter cornbread that came with the lamb and the black pepper grits that came with the short rib and they were fantastic!!!\nFor dessert, even though I was stuffed, I had a few bites of the Valrhona chocolate cake and Meyer lemon mousse- not surprisingly they were both incredible tasting and unique!\nWould come again and hopefully ASAP!","4450":"They only care about your money. The second they are close you are just an accessory that needs to be put away. I'm warning you now! If it's later than 8pm you'll get screwed over","4451":"Visited The Lark while in Santa Barbara. Was recommended by several local people. The dishes are all meant to share. Some small and some entree size. We all picked a few and nothing disappointed!  Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Comfortable dining that could be special occasion or like us a meal after a walk around town. I'll be back on my next visit for sure.","4452":"We visited for a networking event and the staff were extremely friendly! We had a sampling of everything on the menu by far the best was the chicken and grits. The food was quick and tasted amazing. I also suffer from a Gluten allergy and they did an overall good job making sure that my food was gluten free. I was extremely impressed and will return.","4453":"Cool place , layout is nice , good vibe.\nPoorly managed kitchen , food took way to long , two hours plus ! Food was good when we got it.\nNo pacing , floor manager was lost  , didn't see unhappy customers at several tables.\nIts new and is having start up pains , if they don't fix it quickly they will die.","4454":"I went to The Lark Sat night for the second time this year and was very impressed.. From the moment we sat down our server Cassandra was so lovely and knowledgeable, she guided us in our order expertly and seemed to really enjoy her job.. Kinda rare! \nThe food is  great! We started with the  Panzanella salad, had the whole chicken ( there were 3 of us) the roasted carrots .\nThe entire experience was perfect","4455":"Basically my favorite restaurant in SoCal. I am totally obsessed with the popcorn and their cocktails","4456":"Sad to write this review as The Lark has been our favorite spot for date nights and celebrations. Husband and I went there tonight for our 20 year anniversary and it was a disappointment. Food was very average and server was disinterested bordering on surly. I'd have been happy to share feedback with him had he bothered to ask us how our meal was even once. We ordered the Brussel sprout appetizer which has been amazing in the past and it was over cooked and bland. The oysters were disappointing and tough and the meatballs with polenta was the best thing we ordered but the bar was set low. Not sure what changed. New chef? We will be finding a new favorite place to celebrate.","4457":"Love, love, love!\n\nWe started with the brussel sprouts, which are to die for. They come with some lime wedges on the side- USE THEM. \n\nNext came the octopus, which was a little scary sounding but tasted absolutely fantastic, as were the vegetables that came with it. Not a big fan of the pickled pineapple, but those were easily avoidable once we discovered them. \n\nBy far my favorite part of the meal were the bone marrow crusted beef cheeks. Literally melt in your mouth delicious. \n\nWe couldn't not get dessert, so we decided on the cheesecake profiteroles. What a perfect little delightful bite!\n\nThe drinks throughout dinner were great, and our waitress was friendly, patient and attentive. \n\nWe'll be back soon!","4458":"We went to Lark last night. We were very pleasantly suprised at the quick and friendly service. The food was excellent. We had the deviled eggs, with cripy prosciutto, the beet salad and the pork shank. Everything was great! The pork shank was tender and juicy and it came with corn bread, sauteed greens and a yummy blackberry jus. The Pork dish was definitely enough for two and lucky it is, because it is a little on the pricey side at $31, but well worth it. We sat at the bar and we were able to have a drink and eat in under an hour. We will be coming back to try the Cauliflower Au Gratin, as it looks amazing!","4459":"My wife and I had dinner at The Lark last night and could not have asked for a better evening. They have transformed the old Bay Cafe into an inviting, warm space. Our server, Tessa, was knowledgable and charming. One consistent problem with a new restaurant is staffing but The Lark seems to have avoided that. Each staff member we interacted with was friendly and efficient. \n\nNow to the food, it was fabulous!!! From the fried olives, deviled eggs, duck mousse, to the huge pork shank, every dish was delicious and meant to be shared. The bar serves many interesting signature drinks and we tried several.\n\nWe will be going back soon!!!!!","4460":"PHENOMENAL!!!! You won't forget it! From the popcorn (yummy), to the salads, to the entrees, your taste buds will thank you! It was so good that I had to buy the cook book!","4461":"Fun place, great food, fantastic people watching, COOL BIBE, great valet parking! Down sides are that the acoustics are challenging if you want to hear your friends talk, the portions are on the small side for what you pay and it's really hard to get a nice table on busy hours, long wait!","4462":"We went with a large group of family and our toddler and sat outside. \n\nThe service was excellent and the food was great. The ambiance outside was really special.","4463":"We tried this place for dinner and tried three dishes. I have mixed opinions about this place as the experience was not a bad one but there was also nothing that really stood out to me and slightly pricey for what you get. We tried three dishes to share. We had a pasta dish, scallops and a spicy cauliflower dish. All three were not bad but I found the pasta dish and the scallop dishes overly sweet and the cauliflower dish overly spicy, it was hard to taste much else. This may be a matter of opinion as i have heard so many good things about this place and I know people who do like it alot. So this may have been a case of just making the wrong choices of dish for me. They start you off with some free popcorn when you sit down which was nice and the decor is light and airy but also elegant at the same time, they also offer outdoor seating which is heated for the colder days. Our server was also very efficient and service was quick. Definitely make a reservation as this place fills up fast ! I wouldnt discourage anyone from coming here , I think I maybe just did not choose the right dishes for me that night.","4464":"What an amazing dinner! We sat the bar and had the most wonderful bartender and server, Kyle. The popcorn is to die for!!! If anything else go for the popcorn. We had Brussels sprouts, heirloom tomato panzanella salad, and crab risotto all of which I would recommend. 10\/10 for atmosphere, service, and food! Thank you for the amazing experience Kyle!","4465":"My boyfriend and I went here last night to celebrate our one year anniversary and it was great! First off, the free valet parking is a nice perk because it's always hard to find parking in the funk zone. The place was larger than I expected and had a nice outdoor space with beautiful plants. The indoor seating was cozy and family style, but we didn't feel like we were encroaching on the table next to us. Our waiter Ben was really friendly and helpful in taking us through the menu, which is ordered in size of dish. He had great drink recommendations and helped us figure out how we wanted our courses to come out. We ordered a \"snack\" first as an appetizer and then a \"from the farm\" dish and finished off with a \"platter\". I didn't think it was going to be enough to share but we were both full by the end of the platter (they are pretty big portion sizes). We couldn't skip dessert so we went with the wildflower honey cremeux. Amazing. Overall, great atmosphere, very homey but with a classy twist.","4466":"Honestly one of the best dining experience's I've had in a long time.  Our server Cody was fantastic, super knowledgeable friendly and made great recommendations.  Food was top notch and cocktails were unique and memorable.  Have to get the Brussel sprouts and the crab risotto was ridiculously good.","4467":"Amazing cocktails and food. It was great sharing family style so we got to try more things. Not your typical food combinations and was left wanting more after each plate was finished. We had a super friendly and attentive waiting staff too!\n\nWould highly recommend sitting on the patio. It is heated so I never got cold and when the sun started to set the ambiance was so nice with all the outdoor twinkle lighting.","4468":"Had a great time and meal at the Lark. Service started out slow at the communal table then a server that waited on me a year ago recognized me and then came by and said hello then sent over a complimentary appetizer. I was shocked, happy and immediately felt like I was given a warm hug from a friend. Thank you so much. I will definitely be back. Our current server even turned on the charm and she was so nice and friendly.","4469":"Besides great food and a cool atmosphere, their customer services is top notch!  We didn't know who our waiter was and were a little confused when a waiter asked the table next to us if they needed anything and then walked right past our table without saying anything, but someone came over immediately (not a waiter, possibly the manager) and took our order.  Then she brought out a complementary cheese plate because of the wait\/confusion.  Now that's classy!  :)","4470":"Really cool place, amazing food (a tad pricey-but worth it), fun energy, great people watching, has a cool hip vibe! Be prepared for a significant wait- I always suggest to my friends to put their name in and walk around a little bit in the Funk zone totally worth the wait!","4471":"We were riding up on the Amtrak and in search of a celebratory dining option and called in for reservations.  They called back and offered a 5:45 or 9:15 seating option.  We chose the geriatric time of 5:45 since we had a big race the next day.  When we arrived, this place was vibrant and full off the high tax bracket locals getting their weekend started.  The bar was filled with elbow to elbow patrons with prohibition style crafted cocktails and huge planks of shared wooden platters of charcuterie and cheese.  There were 4 valet parkers waiting on the street as we pedaled in and locked up our bikes on the side.  We were dressed in our California Casual bike friendly attire with helmet hair.  On our next venture, we will make more of a fashion effort as the crowd is 40 shades grayer than the State Street twenty somethings.  \n\nOur hostess seated us promptly in a booth which almost made me want to genuflect as it looks like recycled church pews.  The chandeliers are dramatic and the end of the restaurant has paned glass windows with the open view of the army of kitchen staff plating, chopping, and cooking.  If you can sit at the communal table, it would be dinner and a show.  \n\nWe started off with brussel sprouts with the right amount of tenderness, citrus, and smokiness.  The sweetness of the Medjool dates added a layer of flavors which were perfect with a big bold glass of red.  The Spicy Root Vegetable Chips are served with creamy goat cheese which is so light and creamy in texture, we ordered a second batch as we inhaled and scraped every bit from the jar.  Roasted beets and burrata tastes as beautiful as it is plated.  Our main dish of the Bone Marrow Crusted Beef Cheeks was sever on a big plank with rustic vegetables and evokes a feeling of tasting gourmet comfort food.  The meat was so tender and flavorful that after looking at my friends as they tried the dish, we were all in equal meat ecstasy.  Melt in your mouth ecstasy ! it is the stand alone superstar memorable dish of the night. I think it could convert the strictest of vegetarians to being bone marrow lovers. \n\nJane our superstar server was attentive, engaging, and so knowledgeable about every aspect of the food.  She asked if anyone had allergies, followed up to pour our wine, and was delightful the entire night.  Jane alone made our experience 5 star.  The fact that we returned again the next night to go to Les Marchands was testament to the quality of the dining experience.","4472":"Just bumper this down form a 2 start to 1 after I checked my bill and saw the waitress upped her tip. That's just straight stealing! \n\nWow this place is over rated! If it was service alone it would be 1 star. The food is crazy over priced for the quality of preparation. There isn't much more to say... oh wait the service is horrible.","4473":"We held a corporate function in The Lark's private dining room and couldn't be more pleased with the service, environment, and dinner.  The family style shared plates were incredible (especially the branzino).","4474":"The food in this place was everything I expect from a high end gastropub. The duck confit wings were super crispy and flavorful. The scallops were cooked absolutely perfect. The pimento cheese was homemade and spicy and awesome. The cocktails were a let down. They weren't nearly as good as the food. Also this place was $$$$. I guess that's SB for ya.","4475":"We came here on a Tuesday night before the tourist season hit and the place was full.  That was a good sign. Up front, while waiting for our reservation, I tried to get the bartender to make something a little different, but she was too busy to consider what she could make based on my preferences (we have had very lovely cocktails at other places with the same basic instructions. It was a little off putting, but the rest of the night more than made up for it.\n\nFor dinner, we had the deviled eggs, Brussels sprouts, beets and lamb ribs, and of course we started with the popcorn.  Everything was the bomb. The yolks for the deviled eggs were whipped very light and nicely flavored. The Brussels sprouts were nice and crisp on the outside without being heavily fried. I can't call it healthy, but it was healthy-ish.  The beets were a pretty decent sized portion, with strawberries and goat cheese. They used a mix of golden and purple, and the flavor was well done.\n\nThe lamb ribs were the bomb.  More substantial than lamb chops, the full rack was 8 ribs with meat that was nearly falling off the bone. The dry rub spice accentuated the lamb flavor, and it had an excellent mix of fat and lean.  Since I let them know my birthday was upcoming when I made the reservation, the restaurant brought out a free dessert, profiteroles with goat cream cheese filling. Yum.  Cocktails were good, and the wine by the glass was reasonable.","4476":"Can't wait to go back!!! Luv that I took a local there for the first time too!\nBest meal of entire trip and owe to the girls we met while wine tasting in the funk district","4477":"Was really excited about The Lark considering it made so many \"top restaurant\" lists was unimpressed. It was good but for what we paid, not really worth it. $200 total which is pretty insane for two people for basic food. \n\nService was fine. The woman was kind of snobby but she was attentive which was great. And my girlfriend and I agree we would rather have a rudish person take care of you than someone who just disappears. \n\nFood was just ok. Nothing really bowled me over. Typical farm to table but I prefer Farmer's Bottega here in Mission Hills. It literally tasted like it had just come from the farm, with no thought in the cuisine or taste. Not inventive. The brussels were pretty good - probably the best I've had in a while, and we had just had them at Blush the night prior. The Hangar steak was good and rare. Tender, which is great. But the vegetables were mediocre, however, there was a tasty potato(?) sauce that I dipped them in to give them more flavor. If that sauce hadn't been there then it would have been like chewing on a boring green bean - like a cow chews on its cud. The oysters were ok, again, really wanted to love it but it was simply ok. And they were sitting on a bunch of green lettuce which felt like a waste. The fried green tomatoes were actually very, very good. A bit spicy but one of my favorite dishes. \n\nThe main thing that The Lark has is definitely ambiance and decor. Also, it's in the Funk District which is a fun part of town. Other than that, surprisingly I left thinking that San Diego actually knows more about food and cooking than I originally realized. Really appreciating where I live and the food is pretty excellent for the price you pay. All in all, if I could go back in a time machine, I think I would have picked Opal which was originally on my list.","4478":"The Lark and Thomas the manager are a MUST visit in Santa Barbara!! After I made a reservation at the wrong restaurant, Thomas worked his magic and made our first visit to The Lark amazing. The food, service and atmosphere scores at the top of my list. Thank you!","4479":"Wonderful ambience and good food. Service is on point and the food presentation is great. Brussel sprouts are the signature dish but I would say they aren't the best. Highly recommend the lamb.","4480":"On the first visit to the Lark, the food was brilliant, but just a few weeks ago, the food and wine quality declined considerably.\n\nThe previously esteemed diver scallops were served with an incongruous pork belly.  So you have soft spongy textured food together that don't match up.\n\nThe flank steak was unexceptional -- just a bit of chipotle to spice it up.  \n\nAnd the pinot was served in a chardonnay glass to give a sense of greater, false volume.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance is still great.","4481":"I have had mixed reviews about the Lark, as it is pricey and has an interesting menu that does not serve everyone. \nI decided to try it for a Friday night dinner and was very impressed. The service was impeccable, to match the lovely ambiance and vibe of the outdoor area. The fleece blankets and heaters were a nice welcoming touch. \nThe Brie was delicious, and so were the Brussels sprouts. We LOVED the octopus, which was served with farro that was too die for. The goat cheese cheesecake was amazing and I would go back just for that dessert!! Yum!","4482":"My new favorite restaurant! It was my first overnight stay in SB, and we blindly wandered into Lark hoping for some good food. It did not disappoint! The dishes were creative and unique (worried a picky eater like me a bit- not going to lie) but we ordered the pasta and hoped for the best. It was SO GOOD. I cannot wait to come back.","4483":"What pushes this from 4 to 5 stars for me is the customer service.\n\nA large group of us booked The Lark for my friend's 40th birthday this summer.  The Lark really went above and beyond to make this birthday special.\n\nFirst, they hand printed menus wishing my friend a happy 40th along with a special menu of selected items just for us.  What makes the Lark so great is that it is a 'farm to table' type of an establishment and the Central Coast of California is rich with an abundance of delicious items to pick from and put together.   This is why their menu is sectioned by The Ocean, The Ranch, The Farm and Platters.  We had amazing cheese boards and charcuterie boards, pulled pork, oysters, salads, roasted duck with jam sauce, and a heavenly roasted chicken that came with brown-butter smashed yukons, smoked onions, bacon, pea tendrils, and bbq juice.\n\nThe wine list features local and regional wine, something else that is in abundance in this area.  Cocktails are hand crafted.  \n\nWhen we first arrived for our reservation (reservations strongly recommended as this place is always packed) the table before us that was in our reserved spot was lingering...and kept lingering.  Even though this wasn't The Lark's fault they made sure to bring us fresh cocktails and waters and by the time our table was ready they made sure to give some appetizers on the house.  Customer service here is really spot on.\n\nThe environment is very early 20th century and all re-purposed items, with exposed white tiles, dangle lights and shared tables that open to an open air patio complete with flickering fire pits.  Doug Washington of San Francisco's Town Hall and Salt House restaurants is the one who put together the design of this place and it is really soft and lovely.  This inviting environment combined with the customer service being a priority here really makes The Lark feel like home.\n\nYou are also in the Funk Zone of SB with this location so plenty of other cool surf stores, art stores and the Urban Wine Trail nearby.","4484":"Ugh. So ridiculously incredibly delicious.\n\nWent here even though we didn't have reservations and were fortunate enough to be there at a time when the only table for walkins became available.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts were good, as were the goat cheese stuffed fried olives. But the star of the night, hands down, was the housemade gnocchi with slow roasted lamb with pea tendrils and fava beans. I still can't believe how good it was.\n\nEasily the best meal to be had in Santa Barbara. Great ambience and even better food.","4485":"After hearing all the buzz, I was very excited to visit Lark. \n\nWe went on a Wednesday night, and the three of us sat outside on the patio. We brought a couple bottles of wine (corkage is $20\/bottle). The food is reportedly served family style. We started with the fried, goat cheese-stuffed Castelvetrano olives, and moved on to Caramelized Cauliflower Gratin, Little Gems 'Wedge' salad, Pork Belly Sliders, and Whole Grilled Branzino. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Pot Du Creme and the Meyer Lemon Tart. \n\nThe food was generally OK. The Cauliflower Gratin and Pork Belly Sliders were the best of the dishes we ordered. The portions were fairly small, especially for a family-style approach. I don't think it really is family-style, but that's what they're telling people.\n\nThere was something not right about the Lemon Tart. It tasted like liver pate. All three of us tasted this. We pointed it out to our waiter and he said something like \"let me check that out\" and basically never returned. We were charged for the tart nonetheless. \n\nI think The Lark has potential, but they're going to have to make some adjustments in order to truly succeed.","4486":"Came for a corporate event late and grumpy. Acquiesced to staying and was calmed by the manager and the excellent service from Mel and Chelsea who went out of their way to bring me some extra food (which was delicious) and great service! Thank you!","4487":"Good food and a nice atmosphere. Clearly pretty popular so make a reservation. However, the portions are large so don't give in when they try to upsell you. Also the food comes out at an insanely fast pace so don't plan on relaxing between courses. \n\nFave dish: grilled peaches\nLeast fave: porcetta and burrata","4488":"Napa quality without the drive. Would absolutely recommend reservations. We had a 9:30pm reservation. Even though the Restraunt was full the wait was minimal. If you don't like loud atmospheres ask to sit on the patio on the side. If you do the large family style table by the bar is great. Always someone quietly meeting your every need without ever asking 20 questions when your mouth is full. The food... wow the food! Was an experience for the eyes as well as the palate. No fear of giving you foods you may have never thought of eating and making you want to try them again and again. Amazing staff never complained when we didn't realize we were the last ones in the Restraunt.  PS- everyone who brought a dish to the table was knowledgeable, explained each dish. If you can only pick one place in Santa Barbara to go, The Lark should be it.","4489":"I know this restaurant gets wonderful reviews. It's attractive, great atmosphere, the Waitstaff are very attentive. But 5 of us went there tonight for dinner and we all hated our  food. One person sent the mushroom risotto back for being too salty. I love wedge salad, but the salad dressing was too sour. We all left very disappointed.","4490":"So good! Great spot for date night and or girls night. The drinks are great, the wine list is awesome and the food is the kinda' food that you'll crave! That Chicken & grits dish is fabulous. Please don't remove that from the menu. I've been twice and have had great service both times. Try it out!","4491":"Ok. The place is well lit, open inside and out. \nMenus is a little precious, bartenders hard working, service,  they do their very best to accommodate everyone. \nFree valet parking....great bar....appetizers....etc.","4492":"The food and wine was amazing. Try their Brussel sprouts and Hamachi. \nThe ambiance was lovely too. A great place to try out unique flavors with great out door seating.","4493":"The Lark is a new and phenomenal establishment right in the heart of the Funk Zone. From the unique and refreshing drinks to the amazing appetizers, entrees and desserts, this place definitely knows what they're doing! The servers and bartenders are the friendliest and give the best service and experience anywhere in SB. The decor is really unique and gives the whole restaurant & bar a really cool vibe. I highly recommend the Jack Rabbit and The Mule drinks, the beet salad, pork belly sliders, and butterscotch blondie vanilla ice cream sandwich to finish, yum!! And the complimentary popcorn they bring out instead of bread is out of this world! I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. It changes frequently with seasonal ingredients but I can assure you everything on their menu is outstanding and has the most interesting flavors. Make sure to make reservations way in advance if you want to get a table at this amazing place!","4494":"Delicious little spot for dinner. Super crowded, so would definitely make reservations.\n\nFood breakdown:\n-The popcorn: A fun little treat but I actually was not as obsessed as everyone else on here seems to be\n-Brussels: SO good. Was my husbands favorite dish of the night\n-Heirloom tomato panzanella: The various flavors of this dish blended so well together. An abundance of tomatoes, I just wish there had been a bit more burrata\n-Pastrami Beef Tounge on Rye: Was recommended by our waitress or else we never would have gotten this, but I am glad she did! Was really good\n-SB Wild Catch (was a halibut this day) : Cooked really well & I loved the corn succotash that came with this- I just wish there had been more of the succotash! \n-PB Chocolate Granache- Too rich for my tastes but I also am not a dessert fan\n\nOverall, a great dining experience, would definitely recommend to others & would come back!","4495":"Amazing food and staff! What a stroke of luck to find as we were exploring the Funk Zone. Sat at the open table with many other people, cool concept. Loved our meal! Yum! We will be back!","4496":"Came here tonight with a party of 4 and enjoyed several items off the menu. The drinks were exceptional- the industry sour was a favorite of the group. \n\nStand outs were also the pimento cheese, duck liver mousse, manhatten drink, hanger steak, Brussel sprouts, chicken was great and largest portion of all dishes. \n\n1 beef with this place: the charcuterie tray didn't have any cheese! What's up with that?? Beyond that all good!","4497":"Okay - I'm taking a star away. Not sure if that's fair - it's really more 4 1\/2 stars, and here's why: I can't eat much. Is that their fault? Not really, I suppose. I will eat anything from the sea - truly - anything at all. But when they're out of Branzino, then my choices become limited. And that's the story of Sunday night at 9:30.\n\nI ended up eating brussels sprouts and cauliflower (sans bacon breadcrumbs) for dinner. Not the most substantial meal. There are other seafood selections on the menu - either you need to strip them of their pork belly and whatnot, or they are not as satisfying. I had the mussels last time and found there to be not enough mussels so of course wanted to try other options. There's oysters....but again, had them last time and they were actually the weakest menu item because they were huge and not great. Also had the salmon last time....it's the chef's version of a lox and bagel and I'd have preferred an actual piece of salmon....filet, steak, kabob, I don't know....something heartier. So you see my conundrum? And finally, please see my updated review for Blue Tavern giving them kudos for making all the handcrafted cocktails on their list available as non-alcohol options. The teen doesn't really want to have to order coke to go with her mussels and deviled eggs. They do offer one virgin specialty mojito - but you have to know to ask for it.\n\nOkay - that all being said, I have to absolutely, positively show my appreciation for our server. Phenomenal. As he listened to how we were ordering, he was the one who made sure I realized how the salmon was prepared (I had forgotten it was a lox & bagel type preparation), AND when daughter ordered the deviled eggs, he wanted to be sure we were okay with the pancetta that came on top. Dude was tuned in. The Lark does service absolutely, positively spot on. And that, I appreciate.","4498":"Every dish was either too salty, too sour, or covered in sweet sauce.  It was so overpowering that no characteristics of the lamb, vegetables, or steak came forward.\n\nTheir gastronomy was on the same level as Panda Express.","4499":"I went to the Lark this Thursday night. They seated us outside, which was pleasantly warm under outdoor heaters. Our servers were knowledgeable and perhaps a bit too attentive.\n\nWe ordered the charcuterie half plate (comfortably serves two), which I found a bit underwhelming where the meat was concerned. However, the pickled vegetables were deliciously spicy, especially the cauliflower and carrots.\n\nFor the main course w ordered two entrees, the citrus cured salmon with creme fraiche and the pastrami crusted New York steak. The salmon was a small portion, but lovely and fresh (it is raw), and the steak was a bit underdone in that it was quite chewy in parts, but the crust and overall taste were fantastic. The steak portion is comfortably shared with two.\n\nFor drinks, I had the Old Aztec, and was pleasantly surprised at its subtlety. We had the Tahitian vanilla ice cream sandwich, a completely not boring take that included lovely fresh fruit. \n\nAll in all, a great date spot to take your favorite foody somewhere nice, if a bit expensive.","4500":"Good food, good wine, but poor service. From the beginning with the hostess to the end with the server it needed improvement. I definitely will be back but hipster servers need to care about guests more. Food was bomb though","4501":"I was in town having a girl's weekend with a couple of close girlfriends, we wanted to have a nice dinner in a lovely ambiance and decided upon The Lark. Our first impression of the decor and vibe was positive. The restaurant was buzzing with a good mix of patrons. We arrived a few minutes early and checked in for our reservation. I'd say we were greeted ok, nonetheless; indifferently. At one point, I tapped the shoulder of one of the hostesses to ask her a question, she didn't have an answer so she abruptly turned her back to us, and asked the other hostess to assist us, which she did, but they just didn't seem warm or friendly. And a bit preoccupied with the computer screen. I understand it was a busy Saturday night, however, giving attention to the live patron in front of your face should be a priority. We were seated outside on the patio, which was beautifully lit, however, there was a wedding happening next door and the DJ music was loud and echoed through the patio. (not something they can control, but was a slight damper. We almost wedding crashed because the music seemed more lively than what the restaurant was playing!).\n\nThe saving grace of our \"meh\" experience was one thing, our server\nB-R-O-O-K-L-Y-N !!!!!!!!!!! She single-handedly flipped the script on our evening. She was sweet and greeted us so warmly. The first thing she did was apologize for being slightly delayed getting to our table. (We had told the bus person that we were ready to order when she brough over the water.) Brooklyn, not only took our order but made suggested we look into ordering an appetizer being that our entrees may take up to 45 minutes to prepare! We really appreciated that although we opted not to get an appetizer since we weren't starving. That being said, the GEM of a server, came back to the table with three glasses of complimentary Ros\u00e9 from her, since we would have to wait on our entree. We were blown away by her considerate gesture, and praised her generosity! At one point, the evening became brisk, I flagged down Brooklyn to turn on the heating lamp, not only did she do that, SHE BROUGHT US BLANKETS! Did this girl just fall from the sky?! Angel! \n\nLastly, our food came out, we got the roasted chicken and the pasta dish (Chichetti?). The Pasta was delicious! The chicken was tasty, made for yummy leftovers too. In closing, (because this is a novel of a review) there's the breakdown, overall it was a three-star for us. But Brooklyn's service was definitely 5 STARS! That being said, we'll average out our experience at 4 stars, THANKS to Brooklyn. Maybe she could train the other staff????","4502":"This place is awesome. Menu changes by the season and draws inspiration from whatever is local.  The service is pretty good and prompt which may sound like not a big deal but is actually a differentiator in Santa Barbara:) \n\nIt's hard to talk about an entree since they switch every season but in general, I've had the best luck with the fish and vegetable dishes. For the appetizers, the brussel sprouts and burrata are standouts. Their cocktails are pretty great as well -- just as a warning, if the waiter\/waitress says it's going to be spicy, believe them.","4503":"Our first visit to the Lark, food was very good, our waitress was excellent but the hostess was very rude and condescending. We had three contacts with the main hostess on this Friday night and each time her smug rude behavior left me shaking my head. I recommend the food, avoid the hostess at all cost.","4504":"Lamb was over spiced. But roast chicken was good. Wedge salad had too many flavors competing. Brussel sprouts are best food item on menu.","4505":"The Lark met all my expectations! Great service! Even better food, we shared a few plates, the southern pimento cheese, the grilled octopus(table favorite) and a duck dish. Finished the night with a very nice latte! Service was great.","4506":"What a interesting restaurant with so many different flavors. We went here for New Years Eve. Every table was booked but we still got great service and food. Can't wait to go back!","4507":"The most AMAZING service and food, the beautiful outdoor seating added to the extra feeling of being away, felt like Europe. The greatest Brussels sprouts ever with the dates, cheese and fruit is the greatest flavor for your mouth. Top it off with the best sweet corn ice cream and peach cobbler. See you soon","4508":"A must do when in SB. Went there for a bday dinner and everything was outstanding. Great menu with diverse choices, excellent wait staff and great outdoor seating. Cool, funky place in the funk zone. If you are looking for a great brunch try the place right behind it.","4509":"This is my new favorite place in SB.  Great menu, ambience and some nice twists on trendy menu items.  We've dined here twice in one month and can't wait to go back!  The crab gnocchi is out of this world...and the short ribs were deliciously different than any other version I've had.\nEqually good salads and amazing brussel sprouts!  So so good......","4510":"In Santa Barbara tonight my wife and I decided to try The Lark and it did not disappoint. We shared community style the cheese toast, broccolini, and the hangar steak all of which were presented incredibly well. We were also given free Brussels sprouts due to our food taking awhile. They were arguably the best sprouts I've ever had. My one complaint is that the presentation sometimes was overboard and included interesting add ins that didn't necessarily add to the flavor complexity of our food and were unnecessary (ie radish on the hangar steak). Overall though great local spot with a great atmosphere!","4511":"This place smacks of arrogant pretension. It is an obvious hang out for the Montecito set to go slumming. The food was a clumsy presentation, a sauce drenched mess of small portion. It was lacking in soul almost as much as it was lacking in generosity. I spent well over $100 for my wife and I and we walked away hungry and disappointed.","4512":"Great atmosphere inside and out. Dog friendly so wish we had our fur baby with us. A must order is the Southern Picnic, wow what a delicious surprise. The wedge salad had big chunks of bacon and was easily enough for 3-4 people. The branzino was good but wasn't crazy about all the grilled cauliflower surrounding it. Outdoor bleacher seat table was fun and we loved the view of the fireplace, peeps and dogs.  Great energy and vibe located in the funk zone.","4513":"I was SO excited to visit The Lark again after such a wonderful experience in the past. I was passing through SB on a road trip and eating here was all I could think about! I tell everyone how delicious this place is, and have sent many people in. It was Friday night after Thanksgiving and I was one of the first people to walk in the door at 5pm and sit at the bar. \n\nLots of people were waiting out front, excited to dine. Sadly, that's where my excitement turned to irritation. Strangely, I felt ignored at the bar. When I sat down, 2 other groups of people sat around me. Everyone else got greeted and helped first as I sat patiently waiting for someone to warmly greet me and ask if I had questions. That never happened. Someone put menus down, and I felt invisible for 5 minutes. Hmmmm. Ok? After other people got their drinks, I finally got some eye contact. No, greeting or anything so I was pretty annoyed. I ordered the Sticky Fingers and it was delicious. \n\nI tried the Little Gem Wedge and the Brussels Sprouts and of course the food was so tasty. I love the food here! When my food arrived, my drink was empty and I was never asked if I wanted water. As I sat there and ate my food, I kept trying to catch eye contact of the bartenders as they kept walking right past me ignoring my empty drink. I was very bothered by this, and finally I had to flag them down which I hate to have to do! I needed another drink and water. It's really not that hard! One bartender was friendlier than the other and a guy was back there training to barback (it appeared). Either way, I did not feel welcomed and I have a bad taste in my mouth from the service. I sat for 10 minutes until I finally had to ask to have my food wrapped. Nobody asked if I wanted dessert or anything else, so I just put my card down and wanted to go elsewhere.","4514":"My boyfriend set up a dinner with a special menu as a surprise for me. The staff was absolutely amazing in setting everything up, being accommodating of allergies, adjusting the heat lamps, and staying open late because our group hadn't finished our meal. The food was amazing, the cauliflower and pomegranate chicken was a favorite of mine. We ate so much and still had leftovers. The drinks are also really great and a bit spicy. The lighting and decor of the place is beautiful and romantic. I loved my experience. They also have valet parking that gets validated if you eat there!","4515":"I cannot tell you how happy I am to have finally visited The Lark. Came here with the boyfriend and the boyfriend's mom. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nFood: Incredible. What I liked so much was each dish has such unique flavors but they all seemed to compliment one another, without being too rich or \"trying to hard gourmet.\"\n\nBrussels sprouts- WOW! Crisp, flavorful. Slightly sweet, with a hint of Asian influence. My boyfriend licked the bowl clean. \n\nWedge Salad- Good, but not phenomenal. Bacon was too hard, needed more blue cheese. Watermelon radishes were a lovely addition though. \n\nYellowtail- SO good! Fresh and light. The fish was perfect and the accompaniments- the cucumbers and peppers were incredible. Perfectly pickled. \n\nHanger Steak- Nice. The steak was a bit too chewy for my liking, but the highlight of this dish was (believe it or not) the broccoli! Slightly spicy, but not overwhelming and very flavorful. Almost has a charcoal\/grill flavor, which I love. \n\nRisotto- Wonderful. I could have eaten this all day. The combination of flavors from the english peas and goat cheese were delicious. I loved this dish. I would definitely order this one again. \n\nProfiteroles: light, delicious, not too sweet, and not too filling. These were excellent.\n\nChocolate pot de creme: Good, but very strong orange flavor. I preferred the profiteroles over this and I'm usually a choco-holic. \n\n*Cutler's gin and tonic- this was okay, I'm usually a Hendrick's girl, but I wanted to be a good local and try Cutlers. I had gone to their tasting room recently and loved the gin straight. I was curious to see how it performed in a g&t. I was pretty disappointed. I had to send my drink back twice because the tonic was flat. The gin also didn't hold a candle to Hendrick's in a g&t. \n\nAtmosphere: Cool, trendy, and comfortable. We sat inside, but I took a peak outside and the atmosphere looked lovely and more romantic.\n\nService: So professional, warm, and attentive. Our service was amazing. \n\nPrices: So reasonable considering the quality and portion size of the dishes. \n\nOverall, this place is great. I will be back!","4516":"WOW amazing ambiance and tasty fare!\nI've heard of this place so when I was in town I jumped at the opportunity to come. Reservations were easy online, and we lucked out with a table outside by one of the fires. :-) \nPer Yelp recos, we ordered the brussies, the wedge salad, and the scallops. We added the cheeseboard (it was okay but the cheese was kind of sparse. Amazing homemade baguette though!). THE SCALLOPS WERE MY FAV!!!!! Has a small kick and the roasted parsnips and fried tendrils were so delicious =P\nAfter dinner we had a Off the Alpes drink and enjoyed it by the fire.\nNext time I want to try to get a table in the booths inside! \nHighly recommend!","4517":"I would give the food 4-5 stars, but the service caused me to downgrade to a 3. Our very friendly waitress encouraged the four of us to order all of our dishes and cocktails at once (small plates to be shared), and she would pace them out so that everything didn't come all at once. We specifically asked that they bring only two dishes  at a time. Nonetheless, before our cocktails even came, the dishes started coming, so quickly that there wasn't room on the table for everything. We actually had to insist that they take stuff back and wait until we finished the two on our table. And the cocktails didn't come until we were well into our first round of food. When we asked about those cocktails, they said the bar is very busy. Well, of course!  It was 6:00 on a Saturday night-- you'd think they would plan for that!\nIf we go back, we will order our drinks and wait to order just a couple dishes at a time. The food is terrific, imaginative, and beautifully presented. Too bad the rushed service dampened our enjoyment of the experience.","4518":"Amazing meal and great value with a phenomenal atmosphere on the patio. Will be back any time we visit SB. Thanks to the whole staff and Brian from Les Marchands for everything!","4519":"I loved it here!! What a joy to be able to give a 5 star review. The food was exquisite, the atmosphere was so cool and the service was solid. We got the panzanella was is a must-get - the dressing was so delish and the ingredients were wonderful. We also had the fried olives which were flavor explosions; the crab gnocchio was delicious and the bronzino fish was incredible. I just love this place and had to force myself to keep exploring Santa Barbara instead of just going back another time. And sitting at the community table was good too.","4520":"I had the most incredible Pork Shank. The meat fell of the bone and melted in my mouth. The atmosphere and service were stellar... A much needed addition to Santa Barbara. I will definitely be going back.","4521":"Service: 5\/5 to the hosts, 3\/5 for our server\nFood: 5\/5\nAmbiance: 4\/5\n\nWe were ending our central coast trip in Santa Barbara and were looking for a dinner place during Memorial Day weekend. One of the busiest weekends of the year.\n\nThe Lark mainly only takes reservations on busy days like a holiday weekend but the hostess managed to seat us right away due to a reservation cancelation. Lucky us!\n\nThe food was seriously amazing! From the appetizer to the meal. The flavors were precise and elevated each dish. \n\nOur server was a little aloof and took a while to take our orders. Other than that we enjoyed a very lovely meal.\n\nThe Lark is pretty trendy and good for either a date or a night out with friends.","4522":"Ambiance:  great place to hang out with friends or go for a nice date night, but definitely have to make reservations. \n\nService:  our waitress was very nice and helpful,  but her knowledge on the food didn't seem genuine.. As if she never tried the food herself and just went with the reputation.  \n\nWine:  we had a really great Syrah that didn't leave a hole in the check books\n\nFood:  the brussel sprouts were amazing, definitely my favorite part of the meal.  The Himachi had too many flavors going on,  as if the chef was trying to cover something up. Foie gras was good,  but the bread that came with it definitely stole the show for that dish.  The pork belly was all but satisfying. Again there were too many flavors that didn't match.  Lastly, their \"cheesecake\" was glorified cream puffs.  The presentation of the food was beautiful,  however the food itself was trying too hard.  \n\nAccording to my friend, the lark used to be delicious,  but after the hype set in,  the quality of the food diminished.  \n\nI would not go here again if you want really good food, but only if you want mediocre food with a good ambiance.","4523":"Went to celebrate a birthday. Heard great thing about the restaurant. All we enjoyed was the dessert. The squash and quinoa was bland with no flavor. The bone marrow had a huge dollop of thyme. All I tasted was thyme. Horrible! Couldn't see or taste the bone marrow. Only the thyme! After we complained about the bone marrow the waitress pretended like she cared and was pretending to write notes on her pad. When the bill came you would think that would be taken care of but instead she waived the birthday dessert that came which restaurants don't charge for anyway. Very disappointing!","4524":"The Lark is s creative New American restaurant in the center of downtown Santa Barbara. The dishes focus on locally sourced fresh produce. All dishes tend to be a bit spicy and there is clearly a nod to Southern cooking with pimento cheese, cornbread and hush puppies on a number of menu items. The service is warm and friendly. The vibe is great. Cocktails are creative as well. Great wine list as you would expect.","4525":"It's great to see all these new places popping up in the Funk Zone! The dishes here are well combined, well portioned and artfully presented. Considering the price, the food was very good, but not amazing.\n\nThe Lark's staff was warm and the service was absolutely impeccable. I love the ambiance, lots of creatively used repurposed materials with a clean industrial feel. I also like the communal table idea, a fun spot to meet new people over drinks.\n\nThere was a unique popcorn appetizer that was a neat idea as an alternative to bread. The interesting concoction of spices might have been enjoyable if the popcorn wasn't cold and stale. \n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience. I will definitely be back.","4526":"Visited The Lark with my boyfriend for a special date night. The vibes of this place are great and romantic! Drinks were seasonal, refreshing, and delicious. We shared a few small plates and were pleased with the fish dish and bread. However, I found the oysters to taste a bit too fishy. Other than that, I highly recommend The Lark!","4527":"I ate two nights in a row at The Lark with different parties wanting to try the \"new place in the Funk Zone.\"  The d\u00e9cor is fun and well done; inside is crowded and noisy on weekends.  The staff tries hard, but having to listen to a long list of plate sharing ideas and overly-descriptive preparations is a bit much.  The menu is very trendy - every new eatery now has kale, beets and Brussels sprouts on the menu, but herb-crusted bone marrow - really?!  The food was good, not great, and a little pricey.  I can pass on a third visit.","4528":"Tonight was our first visit to The Lark. My mother and I came to dine before going to the symphony. When we were offered a four top outside, we asked to eat inside as we were both wearing thin dresses. The waitress told us to speak with the hostess who we had to stand in line to see again. When we finally spoke with her, she refused to seat us at a four top indoors as she had to reserve it for three or more guests. Meanwhile, both booths next to the table were occupied by couples. We were stuck in a two top behind the host stand where every waiter leaned over us to serve the nearby table. Honestly, the table should not have even been available to any diners. \n\nOur waitress was attentive and eager. We ordered a carafe of red wine ($96) after the $52 carafe was corked. The quail and steak tartare were good. \n\nI understand why a hostess needs to hold four tops, but it was difficult to swallow when we were offered a four top on the patio with no heating. I found it fascinating that all patio dining consisted of women dining together-- and I wondered if the hostesses would have been more amenable if a man asked to be seated elsewhere because his date was cold. Our request, as friendly as it was, seemed to aggravate. The kicker in this is that the booth and the two beside it were vacant when we left. No one had been seated all evening..\n\nHospitality goes a long way in the restaurant business. That's all I'm going to say.","4529":"Vibe - awesome! Very fun place. Good wine and beer selection. My only complaint is food portion sizes for *some of the items. I had a skirt steak and broccoli dish - it was good but the amount of steak served was barely a toddlers portion, so that was disappointing! I've also had a pasta dish though (with pepperdel?)  and that was plenty of food - and yummy. My dad ordered the half chicken - it was a lot of food and seriously delicious! So I would steer away from the small plates (because they are too small for the price) and stick with the full entrees. I've been here a few times and enjoy it.","4530":"Fancy upscale hipster new age vibe\n\nThey have a fabulous 'Goat cheese' cheesecake (shown in pics below)\n\nNice late night drink spot, but gets crowded quickly so I prefer last call\n\n- Valet parking available -","4531":"The Lark is hands down the BEST RESTRAUNT I have EVER eaten at. The people are nice, the food is absolutely phenomenal, and the restraunt setting itself provides a cozy and beautiful atmosphere. You haven't lived until you've eaten here.","4532":"Great appetizers, great outdoor seating area, quality cocktails, great service. No weaknesses at all.","4533":"Had a lovely dinner at The Lark with a large group of friends. Our server RJ was not only a stud muffin but was also an excellent waiter. Everything was prompt and he really cared how we enjoyed our food. His friendliness and fineness really made our night. Food was good too.","4534":"Beautiful ambiance, knowledgeable servers, and incredible menu. Each flavor feels intentionally selected. Beautiful presentation as well. Standouts for me (I'm vegetarian) included the complimentary lemon poppyseed popcorn (so creative!), marinated burrata & pixie tangerines, and maitake mushroom risotto. My family members enjoyed the hamachi crudo and roasted California chicken. Overall, a great place to go to celebrate my sister's graduation. What a treat!","4535":"Fantastic Food! Well priced for the quality of the food you get. We brought our own bottle of wine and with the purchase of another bottle from the wine list they waved our corkage fee, which was a very nice surprise. The only complain I have are the hostesses. Although they are nice they come off as arrogant. The wait stuff was fantastic, friendly, very knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. Will be back soon.","4536":"My wife and I were visiting SB and were given a recommendation from a friend to eat the Lark.  \nWords cannot describe the meal and experience we had there.  \nStarting with the food:   We had the carrots with whipped feta to start.  Who expects carrots to be a highlight?!  They were!!! Unbelievably good. \nNext course:  the hamachi crudo with hearts of Palm.  So amazing.   Last courses for us:   Pappardelle and the blue fin tuna special.   Literally every bite of every course was more amazing than than the previous.   My wife and I walked away and said, perhaps, this was the best meal we've ever eaten.  Anywhere. \n\nCannot forget to mention our server:  Oscar.  Gave us the perfect amount of attention and recommendations.  Also a shout out to the hostess Hannah who seated us perfectly and was so charming.  We cannot wait to return to this special restaurant next time in SB","4537":"Great food and wonderful service. The parking is valet right in front and convenient. It's hard to get reservations so plan ahead and book early. \n\nEach time we come here we order family style and share the portions amongst us. Sometimes the portions are small but surprisingly we are satisfied at the end.","4538":"Features:\n-I had the deviled eggs with crispy pancetta, jalapeno, smoked paprika, and chive.  This is probably one of my two favorites from this place.  It was made especially exquisite with an unforgettable taste.\n-My second favorite dish was the brussels sprouts with medjool date, garum, sasame, and lime.  It was very crispy and flavorful with the dates and lime.  I recommend ordering this!\n-We also tried the roasted beets and burrata with pluots, roasted pistachios, hibiscus vinaigrette, mache, and watercress.  This dish was a little bland for me.  \n-The herb roasted diver scallops had a very interesting yet plain taste even though it came with grapefruit and manila clams.  \n-Lastly, we had the hand rolled pappardelle and crispy braised lamb with acorn squash, grilled radicchio, goat gouda, soft poached egg and rosemary.  The dishes were made to share and by the time this dish came out, I was already full.  The pappardelle was acceptable but not extraordinary.  \n-The heat lamps kept us warm and the environment was very cute and romantic-perfect for a date!\n-Valet parking.\n-The service was superb--A++!.  No complaints.\n\nImprovement:\n-Overall, the main dishes were okay.  I liked their appetizers a whole lot more.\n\nTip:\n-Make sure to tell them if you are celebrating something special, they gave us a postcard and wished us a happy anniversary along with champagne.  Love their service!","4539":"The food and atmosphere here are amazing! All the tables are outside by the fire and they have heat lamps to keep you warm. The waiters are really nice and always check up on you. This was our second time here and it was better than the first time. \n\nWe started off with the Charcuterie board which was really good and had a great spread of meats. It's definitely a must have. The southern pimento cheese came next. It had a nice kick and great flavor. The octopus was also amazing. It was marinated really well  and didn't taste chewy like octopus usually does. It also comes with a yogurt sauce that is to die for. Finally we had the marinated hanger steak which was prepared medium rare. The steak tasted like a normal steak but it came with grilled broccoli that was really good. And for dessert we got the Honey Cremeux which was really light and a great end to night!","4540":"This place is AMAZING! I went with a group & we tried tons of dishes. The Brussel sprout dish & the new pasta dish were my  favorites but everything we got was fantastic. The presentation was perfect & decor is fun also. Try this gem of a restaurant!!!","4541":"Amazing! Food, service, ambiance, all perfect and worth every penny! The popcorn they give you to snack on is super yummy, and is free!! Everything on the menu was amazing. Hands down wonderful experience!","4542":"I asked friends for recs on where to go in Santa Barbara and so many of them mentioned the Lark! from the word 'go', every drink and dish surpassed expectations. 3 cocktails and 5 dishes - not a single dud in the mix! my husband and I said it would even be worth driving 90 minutes to get here. love!","4543":"If i had to sum this place up in one word it would be...AMAZING! From the location, the atmosphere, the service and even the other patrons are all on point! I love food and trying different things and places. The Lark was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. The food was so good, it was hard to decide what to get and even harder to stop eating, I had to unbutton my pants before we left!","4544":"Very delicious, but very expensive and the waiters are very particular about the way you order. (Have to order all at once even if you kind of just want to pace it out yourself.)","4545":"No. Just no. This place is ridiculous. \nWe went with friends who were celebrating their wedding anniversary. They made reservations a week in advance. They planned this weekend and this evening 6 months in advance. We drove up from Los Angeles, one friend drove down from Bakersfield. We were seated at table, though in a lovely outside location in the corner,  was TINY, like all the tables there. They call this a \"family style- sharing restaurant.\" This concept was explained to us repeatedly during our evening. On first approach, our waiter seemed incredibly unhappy to be at work, and incredibly impatient with us, so much so that all five of us noticed it. Having been a server myself in the past, I assumed he was busy or having a rough night, we all made excuses for his rude behavior, and assumed he would soften up once he took our full order. We were wrong. We ordered a bottle of chardonnay and the brussels sprouts to start, which came quickly and were good. We then proceeded to order another bottle of wine and place our main order. After again having the menu explained to us....\"these are sharing dishes\".....the platters are LARGE. Ok, we are all hungry and each wants their own dish. We each ordered a main (platter) dish. After giving the waiter our order, I repeated the order: ok, so 3 of the diver scallops, one pasta, and one hanger steak, medium well. Yes, thank you. First came the pasta. My friend who ordered the pasta patiently waited for the rest of us to get our food before starting hers. She waited, and waited. 10-15 minutes later 2 of the scallop dishes came out. In between other servers tried to bring us other peoples food and drinks. \"You did not order this?\" No. Finally my steak came, and the person delivering it (not our waiter) said, steak rare...I said \"no, I ordered it medium well, and my husband's ordered scallops like the other two people at the table, but he has not received his yet, are you out?\" The waiter came over and said \"you only ordered two scallops. if you want another i can put it in, but you will have to wait at least 30 minutes for it because you only ordered two.\" Um, no, I said, We went over this, remember? Him: \"No. You ONLY ORDERED TWO. (he stated adamantly) My husband: \"No, we ordered 3, my wife went over it with you.\" Waiter: \"NO. YOU ORDERED TWO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER??????\" My husband: \"What I would like is the food that I ordered.\" Waiter: \"YOU DID NOT ORDER IT.\" My husband: \"Can I please speak with the manager?\" Manager comes over. Again, she explains to us, as though it is a hard concept to grasp: \"We are a sharing restaurant.....you only ordered enough to share.\" Um no!!!! We ordered a dish for each person! (Beware future diners: diver scallops to share, considered a LARGE platter, are 3 scallops with a drop of risotto at $34. Not shareable unless you are a bird.) We explained to the manager that we ordered the dishes, we reviewed the dishes with the waiter before the order went in, and what came out was a pasta dish 20 min before four of the other dishes and one dish not ordered at all. She offered to pay for my husband and my meal, but we said we didn't want to stay and eat, it had already been an hour at this point and we were quite frankly sick of the attitude and the place. After much discussion, we paid the entire bill less our two dishes and left with our friends. This place is ridiculous. If you want to have fancy, expensive food, then you should have fancy, expensive service. We did our part. We made a reservation, bought two expensive bottles of wine, appetizers and TRIED to eat a TINY dinner at a TINY table with an angry waiter. Food came staggered and not at all, then we were told we never ordered it. Sorry, we will take our $300 elsewhere next time.","4546":"On the pricier side...I'm actually surprised this place averages 4.5 star. I think its more of a 3.5 (the ambiance is nice) but I guess for Santa Barbara, this is a cute place with a nice outdoor area. If this restaurant was in LA, they would need to improve the service. \n\nOur server was \"nice\". But she definitely didn't go above and beyond by any mean.  She told us that they were more of a tapas style restaurant where we'd be sharing and the # of dishes she told us to order was outrageous. On top of that, my one friend told her she liked very sweet, fruity drinks and the drink she recommended was far from sweet. When we told the waitress that it wasn't sweet enough, she didn't offer a new drink. About 10 minutes later, I decided to complain on my friend behalf, she said she will bring out simple syrup. Even after that simple syrup, my friend wasn't happy with her drink so she drank maybe half. The waitress didn't seem to care or notice, I gave up at that point.\n\nThe food was not bad. I think I eat out waaaaay too much and my standards are super high these days. Though some of the dishes were good, I do take into account the price which I didn't think was worth it for the portion we got. For instance, their deviled egg was 3 halves for $5.  I think I make better deviled eggs. Their brussels sprout was very good. I didn't care for their crab gnocchi but the others in my party seemed to love it.  My favorite thing was the free popcorn they gave us...haha. \n\nI don't know what it is but my Santa Barbara dining experience this time around wasn't great overall. We ate at 3 restaurants and I was unhappy with them all. Next time I think I will choose all the restaurants - I didn't have a say on this trip!","4547":"When this place opened it seemed to elevate the overall dining scene in SB. Now some other competitors (not to mention area hotels) have caught up and maybe The Lark has lost just a smidge of its allure. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great restaurant. The food and service are excellent, there's just more options now. Anyway, I've only been a few times myself and still look forward to returning. In fact, I'll come back in the spring when maybe the menu will be fresh and new to me.","4548":"I'm a foodie. I don't always review places but this place was sorely disappointing. The food is more like Sink to Table. There's a general lack of taste in all of their dishes and the chef mixes the wrong elements of taste together. This isn't working for them. The ambiance is lively and cute. But don't waste your time and money here. There are far better places.","4549":"Pretty disappointed, according to many websites we visited, The Lark is the place to eat so we decided to give it a try. \nFirst of all, when we made the reservation we asked for an outside table, we ended up sitting In a corner of the restaurant Inside (close to a door) sitting in a confessional which is really pretty, I have to admit, but really uncomfortable :-( \nWe ordered 2 cocktails, we had to return one of them(the hummingbird) it didn't taste like anything. Then I ordered a glass of white Sauvignon, nothing crazy either, it tastes like a cheap wine (14$ a glass)\nThe deviled eggs! Let's talk about them, according to many reviews it was the \"must try\", it was just a regular deviled eggs with a pancetta chips. Nothing to get excited about. \nThen we ordered the scallops, 3 scallops for 32$, served with couscous, it could have been interesting but all the ingredients didn't go good with each other, scallops were good but the rest of the dish didn't really have any taste. It didn't look pretty in the plate, really disappointed about this. If it s not really tasty, at least try to make it pretty! \nThe second dish was the goat confit, we liked this one, not really pretty in the bowl but at least it was good. Pretty tasty, interested flavor except the fig, they were not really good and no idea why they were here for, it didn't add any value to the dish. \nOverall, we were disappointed, maybe our expectation were too high (like your prices) ! \nAt least we got a good laugh!","4550":"Always a good experience at The Lark! The servers are always attentive and helpful!  My favorite cocktail in Santa Barbara is the Jp's Paloma from The Lark but they always have fun new drinks on the menu- very creative! The food is fun, inventive and full of flavor!  Brussels and the wedge are always a must and I love that the menu changes often, there is always something new to experience!","4551":"Read the negative reviews and believe them.  If you are visiting Santa Barbara go elsewhere where you will experience the true kindness of Santa Barbara.  Many many fabulous places in Santa Barbara... just NOT the Lark. \n\nThe place was empty at 5 when we arrived.  Sat us under a speaker at first so we asked to be moved.  Then they sat us right on top of another couple.  We asked to talk to the manager because the hostess was rude.  I don't know why.  She seemed determined to sit us in the worst possible places... Maybe because we asked to put our name in 5 minutes before they opened??  Manager came out and started quoting labor laws about breaks??  What??  Again, empty restaurant!!!  Crazy experience.  Rude, insane staff.  So we walked out.  We didn't need a lecture about labor laws.  We just wanted a decent table in a empty restaurant.  Never again.....  \nWe are locals. Many fabulous places in Santa Barbara.  Stupid stupid mistake on their part.  We eat out 4 times a week in Santa Barbara and we won't waste our time with this place again.... We will definitely tell our friends about our experience.  \n\nMenu seemed iffy and pricey but we were going to give it a try even though most seating involves uncomfortable metal chairs in patios with loud music.","4552":"The chef here is absolutely creative, and the restaurant clearly has such tremendous potential.  But in spite of this, our experience was less than satisfying.  Judging from the average rating, it was probably just one of those every-so-often times when things just don't go right.  \nThese were my specific gripes:\n1.  My wine glass was dirty.  I showed the waitress that it had a dirt coating on the inside of the glass.  The second glass our waitress brought was equally dirty.  When she brought the third glass -- which was clean -- she said that it can happen that a piece of cork can end up in the glass, as though that had been the problem.  I believe people should own up to their screw ups.\n2.  The heirloom tomato panzanelle salad was ridiculously unevenly salted.  In particular, some of the bread pieces were too salty to eat, while others were fine.\n3.  The grilled octopus with cauliflower in squid ink was delicious, but the portion of octopus in the dish was meager.\n4.  The 72 hour marinated short rib was tough.  Forget the fact that we were given rounded fish knives and would probably have fared better with butter knives, but even after asking for and getting steak knives, the meat was still tough. \n5.  The tables for 2 are so close together.  \nI don't mean to discourage anyone from trying the restaurant.  Like I said, it's got a creative flair that you won't find in most other places.  It just didn't work out well for us that night.","4553":"BOOM! This place changed my life. Okay, maybe not my whole life, but certainly my level of expectation when I eat. They may have ruined me for restaurants in general. The service was phenomenal, even down to a hand written congratulations on our 5 year anniversary. The staff was knowledgeable about every course, and every wine. The food was prepared perfectly, each course arriving at the perfect time so we never felt rushed and we're never kept waiting. I would highly recommend you take your favorite person here, just make sure you call ahead!","4554":"Intense flavors! All dishes had a very complex composition. It started with a Masala flavored complimentary popcorn with crispy fried basil leafs, surprisingly good. We ordered Hamachi Carpaccio & Oysters for appetizer. Not your usual carpaccio. It came with a beautiful coconut citrus sauce, herbs & nuts, beautiful flavors. The oysters were a complete let down, small, tasteless and over priced. Roasted Brussels Sprouts also had complex flavors covered with dates, sesame seeds & apple cider vinaigrette. Different & delicious. One of our main dishes was the handmade pappardelle with black truffle sauce, mushrooms, roasted squash & hazelnuts. The butter sauce was really good and had a wonderful truffle nose to it. But the pasta itself was a bit too hard\/undercooked, not al-denti. Also could have used more mushrooms instead of squash. Then came the lamb ribs. One of the most unique & delicious dishes, and very complex & tense! It had a beautiful sauce with a kick. The spice rub on the lamb was crusted & delicious. The meat melted it your mouth. Corn bread was one of the best I've ever had! Had to finish all that yumminess with a dessert, bread pudding. Came with a beautiful sauce & well-balanced. That wraps up our meal. The restaurant itself had a really nice lighting & ambience and the staff were really nice & helpful with the menu. Recommend checking out this restaurant & the fun bar in the back of visiting Santa Barbara.","4555":"Had an awesome and delicious dinner here. Our waiter was fantastic with food knowledge and was very attentive. I really loved the marinated and grilled hanger steak. We also had a complimentary dessert for my birthday so thanks to all of the staff. I recommend coming back to this place.","4556":"Housed in the former Santa Barbara Fish Market, this Santa Barbara hot spot exudes local charm, historical significance and modern style. The space is warm and inviting with vestiges of the Lark's industrial past seen all around. The staff are personable, fun and attentive. Entrees range from $17-$42 but many can be shared family-style.  Enjoy an alfresco garden party on the lovely patio trimmed with delicate lights or cozy up under a heat lamp with a fleece blanket on one of those chilly Santa Barbara evenings. \n\nMy friend and I shared several appetizers. The Rosemary & Brown Butter Cornbread served with a child honey butter was the perfect opener. You get a very nice herbal punch from the rosemary but it's very subtle and refreshing. My friend and I loved the wonderful marriage of rosemary and sweet brown butter. \n\nThe Crispy Brussel Sprouts come garnished with medjool dates and sesame seeds and drizzled lime. They are crispy and crunchy with a touch of sweet from the dates. Our server warned us that the brussel sprouts are a good sized --they can almost double as an entree--appetizer so we swapped one of our entrees we were going to order for a salad. \n\nThe Yellowtail Hamachi Crudo highlights some of the fresh summer seasonal ingredients bringing together compressed watermelon, shishito peppers, summer gazpacho, candied coriander along with some fresh lemon and basil. The enticing flavors are very well balanced.   \n\nWe shared the Little \"Gems\" Wedge salad featuring house smoked blue cheese, warm glazed bacon, spicy pecans all tossed in a refreshing herb vinaigrette. This beautifully oversized salad is dressed with so much fresh Santa Barbara bounty and is just so beautiful to behold. We really enjoyed this salad especially on a warm Santa Barbara summer evening paired with some wine. My friend picked up a nice Tempranillo from one of his wine tasting stops so we shared a bottle over dinner. There is a $25 corkage fee. \n\nThe Hand Cut Pappardelle was excellent. So rich, robust and infinitely creamy. It's accentuated with piedmont white truffles, shaved parmesan, English snap peas and pine nuts. It looks small but it is so filling (2 of us didn't even finish it) especially when paired with one of their salads and an app or two. I would definitely order this one again. \n\nWe shared a wonderful dinner at the Lark. This place is very popular so be sure to book your reservation. Valet parking is available as the parking fills up quick. It's a short jaunt to the beach so you can enjoy a nice post-meal evening beach stroll.","4557":"Came here after work for a group dinner and the food was excellent. We tried a variety of dishes and I can't really pick a favorite. Everything was good. I do think one of my favorites was the melt in your mouth delicious gnocchi with lobster, definitely on the richer side than the other dishes, but an outstanding flavor. Kind of crowded. A little on the hip\/cool side of things, and since I'm not really the sort or of the age to fully appreciate or care about hip or cool decor and mismatched silverware, it's probably not a place I'd regularly go unless I lived super close or was into the more trendy side of the Santa Barbara scene in general. But despite my preferring low key, they did do a great job conceptually (if you're the sort who requires a concept to accompany a good meal). It's casual, a little trendy, but also obvious that actual thought goes into the dishes. And it's also served family style. This was both a plus and a minus, but gave everyone an opportunity to try a little of everything. Self parking is a little tough, but they do have valet if you're into it.","4558":"My boyfriend and I found out about this place from a google search for restaurants in the funk zone of Santa Barbara.  The article we read said lark is a 5 Star dining experience, so we decided to give it a try.  5 stars is a lot to live up to, so we had high expectations.\n\nWe made reservations for 9:00 PM and checked in with the hostess exactly at 9:02 PM.  The hostess said, \"Give us a few minutes and your table will be ready.\"  10 minutes later I checked back.  The same hostess looked over her shoulder to the left and turned back at me, \"They're setting you up now.  I'll come get you at the bar when it's ready.\"  Another 10 minutes goes by.  This time my boyfriend goes to the hostess and she told him a few more parties are before us, so we still have to wait.  We didn't appreciated being lied to, and at this point it's 9:23 PM.  Our patience was waning, but we were finally seated at 9:27 PM.\n\nOur experience turned around for the better after we were seated.  Everything we ordered tasted great.  The free popcorn starter was a pleasant surprise, and we couldn't get enough of it.  Our waiter was very helpful with suggestions, and knowledgeable with all the ingredients, and answered all our questions.\n\nIt seems the menu is seasonal, and changes all the time.  There were some Asian influences in our dishes, which we both enjoyed and appreciated.  We really liked the ambiance, and atmosphere of the restaurant.  I'd give this place another try considering the issues with our table.","4559":"I have eaten at The Lark numerous times but recently have been so disappointed. While the food is consistently good, the last few times I felt very rushed. They insist that you order all at once (so the chef can time and pair the offerings) and it all came out so quickly! Some dishes were cold by the time we got to eating them. And this happened a couple of different nights. When I go to a shared plate restaurant I want to take my time and order as I go, not be rushed to order everything and then made to feel like the table is needed. \n\nMy last straw though was that two times in a row I have tried to make reservations for a larger group, once for 6 guests and once for 8. Both times I was told that the only available times were 5:30pm and 8pm. I was making both reservations 5-7 weeks in advance! I tried to explain that those times were not an option and they refused to be flexible. It seems to me that a well run establishment can cater to all sizes of parties at any time! The lack of flexibility out weighs the food and ambiance. They may have gotten too big for their britches too quickly. They have annoyed one local who will stick to the local owners who understand the way Santa Barbara works. Boo on The Lark.","4560":"Everything is family style here and they change your plates as often as the Chinese seafood restaurants so that's a good thing! Overall, the food is just okay for my palate. I originally picked this place because I heard the duck was so good it leaves you weeping but it didn't. IF you've had sam woo bbq's duck, then you'd be crying because that's the best way to eat duck IMO. Also, I thought it was weird and slightly rude that the hostess told us we can sit outside but needed to leave in 2 hours at 8pm because there was a reservation coming. We left close to 8pm and the tables around us were empty. -__-\n\nBBQ Chipotle Popcorn: This is complimentary. It's okay. \nBrussels Sprouts: A must-get!! This was the best dish of the meal. My party of 3 voted and this one won. \nLittle Gem Salad: Good. The bacon bits made it better. \nOctopus: A bit soft and tasted weird when eaten by itself but if you mixed all the stuff that's on the plate together, it taste SO MUCH BETTER!\nDuck: The homemade biscuit was delicious. The duck was just okay for me and my friends. \nBone marrow: Weirdest thing ever. Our first time and it was like eating fat..expensive fat. The pretzel bread was SO GOOD!\nPineapple upside down cake: This one was really good and came in second as our favorite dish of the night. \n\nPARKING: Their parking lot is valet only but there's street parking. We are not from the area and so were surprised to find how close the adult district is to this location. We parked in front of spearmint rhino so I guess for real fun, you and your friends and go there afterwards haha.","4561":"2.5 stars - \nValet & Decor - 5 stars; Food and timing of food - 2 stars; Service - 3 stars\n\nAs an East Coast visitor, I came with my significant other and their family on a Saturday night for a reunion dinner. After leaving our car to the valet, we were seated, met by the beautiful display of what might feel like a modern take on an old-fashioned whiskey cocktail. With cool yellow lighting and a decent volume of ambient noise, we were seated at our table. \n\nWhile the service - both food and valet were good touches, the food was simply one-note, which unfortunately is a disappointment, especially for a sharing dish type establishment.\n\nFood: \n-The starter popcorn - a nice kick of heat to start the meal off\n-The cheese board - tiny pieces of cheese with a nicely toasted bread, but I think the quantity was on the low side for $16, there were tons of pistacchios on the board.\n-Brussels sprouts - a blackened exterior, a bit on the soggier side, rather sweet and had quite a punch of spice that was rather repetitive\n-Cauliflower - honestly this tasted the exact same as the Brussels sprouts, a charcoaled blackened texture with similar splashes of sweet and spice, sprinkled with a handful of cashews.\n-The rabbit and pork belly rilletes were actually quite the one redeeming feature of this meal, with a light tender piece of meat, but again with nuts and berries. This was accompanied by a lavender-scented bread that was almost overpoweringly-fragrant. The bread itself was nicely toasted, but I think the aroma itself was heavy-handed and could have been edited down.\n-Lastly, the supposed finale course of the roasted chicken. Our waiter initially suggested a half chicken, but we opted for the whole in case we would take the leftovers home. It came in a large skillet, but the size was so small, especially for a chicken of $42. While the skin was crisp, golden, the meat inside was unevenly textured, bland, over and undercooked in different aspects, and dry. The potatoes and other fixin's were fine, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe family has had many meals here before and were unfortunately quite disappointed with their dining experience this weekend. \n\nTips\/Takeaways:\n-The roasted chicken for $42, whole - I could've gotten a better deal with a $6 chicken from Sam's Club, Costco, Giant, etc. \n-I could also have taken a spoonful of sugar, some spice and a handful of nuts to recreate just about the same flavor profile for all of our dishes (minus the rabbit\/pork belly).\n-Based on my experience, I would not recommend return. However, I would say if you are here, the redeeming dish of the meal would be the rabbit\/pork belly rillete.","4562":"My sister & I were in town with the two teenage nephews.  We left them at the hotel tonight to have some adult time to ourselves and boy did we choose right.  The brussel sprouts & everything else we had was amazing, however the service is really what put it over the top.  Michelle on the outdoor patio offered outstanding service!","4563":"Its upsetting to not give this better stars because the service is good and the ambience is lovely but the food just isn't good.... this was my fourth visit.... so clearly I've given them many tries.  The food is so heavy and way over seasoned and over done. They do have a nice wine list though, and really lovely people working there.  Easy valet parking and dog friendly.  They need to update their menu though - they rave about their Brussels sprouts and honestly - they aren't good and we always order them.....","4564":"The food was all fantastic. I was worried that it would have been overhyped, but it stood up to all of the rave reviews I had heard. \nWe went last night and tried the Brussels sprouts, sunchokes, short ribs, whole chicken, and risotto. I think that the only dish we didn't really care for was the risotto, but not because it was bad. It was just not nearly as good as everything else. The Brussels sprouts and short rib were the favorites in our group, but the chicken and sunchokes were also very delicious. \nNothing to complain about with service. Very attentive, but not overbearing. \nAtmosphere was cozy and warm. Could have maybe used a bit more heat on the patio, but it wasn't terribly cold. \nLooking forward to visiting again.","4565":"Came here for a conference meeting and I must say, the customer service, the time of waiting and everything above was incredible. From the food which by the way was amazing, man the deserts are to get hooked on. I must say you pay for what you g et and its worth it.","4566":"Visited about a month back and found it to be an instant favorite.\n\nThings that stand out include:\n\nFree valet parking\nGreat ambience. The restaurant is beautiful and offers indoor \/ outdoor seating.\nService. We sat at the bar which wound up being a perk because the tender was a total pro.\nThe drinks were interesting and hit the spot, both cocktails and wine.\nOur food included the brussels sprouts, short ribs and oysters. All interesting in both presentation and taste. The short ribs were some of the best I've ever had.\n\nWill be returning for sure.","4567":"We went here at 6pm and the hostess told us the waiting time is 3 hours, next seating is at 9pm.., Are you kidding me!!!? There is many restaurants around here so no ThAnk You.","4568":"Loved this place. The pork belly was amazing, and the pappardelle pasta was so fresh and tasty. Will return whenever we're in Santa Barbara. Five stars.","4569":"Spot on fun atmosphere, good service and excellent food. Family style dining with delicious combinations of flavors. A couple items ran a drop sweet for my taste, but were still excellent. Brocollini with goat cheese, fried chicken and pork chops were amongst our groups favorites. Excellent apple cobbler finishes the meal right.","4570":"I guess we were lost in the  vortex. \nI took my daughter for dinner on her birthday. We had a reservation and arrived on time. After a 10 minute wait were seated on the patio next to the entrance of the dining room. We were greeted and given water and waited and waited for someone to come back. We asked (after 10 minutes )if  bus person could ask if we had a waitress? Finally someone arrived and took out drink order. This order did not arrive until after our dinner arrived. We ordered chicken and a fish entre. We watched as the table next to us got plate after plate of food. By the way, they were seated just before we were. We waited almost almost 30 minutes to get our dinner and cocktails. At this point we had been in the Lark for an hour and 30 minutes. \nThe server apologized and offered another drink which neither of us wanted.\nIt wasn't a great experience especially on a special occasion.","4571":"Went in a few weeks ago for dinner with some friends. It was busy and a little bit of a wait, but it was busy and they were very mindful of us and accommodate us very well. We got a round of drinks while we waited for the food we ordered. Very delicious, our server Sam, was very attentive and guided us through the menu very well. She made some wonderful and knowledgeable suggestions, such as the duck. I wasn't disappointed. She was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our experience. Very pleased.","4572":"I have been wanting to go here for a while now and finally had the chance last night. I absolutely love the atmosphere of this place and the service was top notch! This is a big restaurant and everything was really well executed. Props to all the staff here. Our group really enjoyed the \"family\" style plates and it was a great experience to try a little of everything. The pork belly and steak tartare were stand outs but damn that goat cheesecake was just off the charts. Drinks were great too. If I lived closer I'd definitely be a regular.","4573":"ha to be honest not too hot. too many wanna bees, and the food was just very random. not worth the trip.","4574":"It's a bit crowded so you'll be sitting close to other patrons, but the food and drinks are awesome.  My favorite things on the menu were the bone marrow, fried brussel sprouts, and shishito pepper","4575":"Had a great time at the bar here last night.  Drink a were delicious, strong and the brussel sprouts were tasty tasty!! I'm definitely coming back.","4576":"Together with local wine we had a fabulous evening. When we left the waiter showed us a good spot for cocktails around the corner. Super tasty food and great beer selections!","4577":"This is a hip place that has both inside and outside seating. I sat outside, and it was warm because they have fire pits and heaters. If that isn't enough they will even provide blankets. To start I had the oysters, which were way to big. The waiter was amazing because he came back to our table and explained that their oysters were usually smaller and was extremely surprised because he had never seen oysters that big. For my main course I had the mussels, which had a delicious broth. In my opinion they could have put more mussels in the bowl with the broth. To finish, I had the lemon tart which was exquisite. \nOverall, the restaurant was nice, the food was good, and the our waiter was great. I would definitely come back.","4578":"Two of us dined at The Lark on a Friday night.  Arrived early for our reservation and had to wait a little, but one of the servers was kind enough to bring us drinks while we sat on the bench.\n\nFood was great.  We were a little off-put by the 'family style' but when the server explained the concept we went with the flow, ordering a total of 4 plates which we shared.  The braised pork belly was the best I've ever had - there were so many layers of flavor!\n\nDown sides: the metal chairs used in the outside areas are the most hideously uncomfortable I've ever sat in.  The bar has a poor selection of spirits (I had to try 3 times to find a vodka for my martini).  Our server had some friends at a nearby table and spent far too long chatting with them.\n\nBottom line: we will definitely return when we are in SB again.","4579":"Absolutely amazing food. Great atmosphere. Perfect for a date night. Wait time could be a bit long but we were fortunate grab a table near the bar within 5 minutes - so glad we were so lucky! Will definitely be returning next time we're in Santa Barbara!","4580":"Came for a special birthday dinner for a friend.  The Brie starter was amazing, the foie gras \"p\u00e2te\" delicious.  But we cannot eat pepper or spicy foods and we asked if they could accommodate us.  They said yes.  They lied.  Scallops were served w hot hot red peppers - we said we asked for those to not be included in the prep - they took it back and just picked the peppers off!!  Brought it back, still hot as hell but we didn't know until it was too late what they had done.  Made some of us sick for 24 hours. I won't be back to this place.  Food pretty good, service abysmal.","4581":"Loved this place. Shared plates is my favorite. Mentioned it was my birthday and had to request a dessert. Prefer restaurants who treat their customers with a birthday dessert without having to request it.","4582":"Im not sure what we missed. We had higher expectation maybe? We were seated promptly with our reservation. Out waitress was not so friendly or personal but I guess adequate enough (3stars). There were three other people that came by to serve us including this guy waiter who didn't say hi or smile or nothing to pour wine and left. No hello or this is wine you ordered or anything. Kinda weird we thought. We ordered brussels sprout, cheese bread, ribs and the lark carbonara. Brussels sprouts and cheese bread were good and flavorful but salty and heavy. Ribs were absolutely horrible. Our teeth were hurting because they were so dry. They fell off the bone not because meat was tender but because it was so dry and hard. We had one each and couldn't eat any more. The waitress did take it back and took it off the bill though. Carbonara had a bit of fusion thing going on w pork belly and other herbs but it failed :(. Wasnt good as a pasta or carbonara.  Ambience was good w outdoor seating but food was overall so so and service was so so.  We crossed it off and probably not come back.","4583":"This is one of my favorite restaurants not just in Santa Barbara but in Southern California!! The atmosphere, staff and food are fantastic! The Brussels, Short Rib and Cheesecake made me want to come up with an excuse so that my wife and I can come back to Santa Barbara just to visit this restaurant! Thank you for a wonderful experience :)","4584":"My friends and I headed out of LA and up to Santa Barbara for a girls trip and The Lark came highly recommended. We made a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday night and they were able to seat us as soon as we arrived. The ambiance was nice inside but not quite to the level I'd imagined. The moment we sat down at our table, the stares and whispers began about our table between the staff. Seeing as we sat close to the station they were ringing the checks up, I'm not sure why they thought we wouldn't notice. The eye rolls and laughs were very apparent. \n\nI will say that the Brussels sprouts and the tagliatelle were out of this world amazing! The sea bass was good but not mind blowing. We felt the scallops were chewy and not worth the price. Some of us enjoyed the pork belly but others didn't, and the squash and farro just had too many flavors going on. \n\nWe also had mixed feelings on the cocktails. Some enjoyed their drinks while some of us didn't. All in all I'm not entirely sure what the hype is about. It would have definitely been a nicer experience if their staff was more mature. We were nothing but polite and we just didn't deserve to feel the way we did.","4585":"Terrible service to accommodating an out of town party who made a reservation two months prior. The three hostess were condescending and denied reservation. Our party waited 30 minutes while the hostesses spoke to the manager. This issue was never resolved, or even mitigated.","4586":"I loved my date at the Lark! The place is very intimate and comfy, and I thought some of the dishes were very creative. We started with the Vaquero cocktail, my fav of the 3 drinks we got.\n\nWe enjoyed the beet salad, which had both steamed beets and shaved raw, with burrata, greens, and puffed wild rice. Thought I'd seen it all with beet\/soft cheese salads but no! This was different and tasty.\n\nOur entrees were quail - battered and fried with sauce, nice n spicy - and the Santa Barbara catch of the day, which was seared bigeye tuna. \n\nFinally, dessert was a choco ganache with seasonal ice cream, fresh mint, and cookie crumbles. I have had this before but it's fail-safe and so satisfying. \n\nDefinitely a place we'll hope to come back for a future date!","4587":"Amazing sevice-from the hostess to our waitress, Hannah.  Hannah was both knowledgeable and conversational.  She has fun with her job but also provides a great understanding of the ingredients and what each guest may enjoy.\n\nHighly recommend the brussel sprouts, the bone marrow, and the deserts.  The salad we ordered definitely needed MORE WARM PEAR in order to balance the bitter radicchio!  The chicken had an \"interesting spice\" to it, not 100% sure I would recommend the chicken.\n\nThe music was great, and it seemed like the \"place to be\" for a late Thursday night dinner.   The seating is spacious and there are some interesting alcoves that you can sit in.  Plus, the heat lamps and blankets for outdoor seating are killer.  \n\nOverall the service and the 5Star dishes made this a great dining experience.","4588":"So it's been a year since I've eaten but came across the pictures I had taken and figured I'd write a quick review...\n\nThe Lark is a super popular kind of hip place to eat. Finding parking in the area is rough and you gotta get lucky. That's exactly what it's like getting a table too. Either reserve far in advance, wait for 2 hrs or get lucky at the communal table, which we managed to do. A group was just standing up as we walked in so we snatched it right up! \n\nThe restaurant is cozy with all the wood, the communal tables and the patio outside. It feels homey yet festive with all the chatter around you. We went tapas style between the three of us and shared the Pancetta deviled eggs, Brussels sprouts, hamachi crude, smoked pork belly, and black garlic glazed lamb shank. And while I cannot remember the exact taste of anything, I just remembered it all to be super delicious and fresh. The menu changes so my guess is that some of the dishes will come back around. We also had a few cocktails that were well balanced and delicious. \n\nThis is a great place to enjoy some good food with the people around you. I'll definitely come again if I'm in the area.","4589":"I have dined at The Lark many times and while in town for a business trip we had dinner since i knew it would be on par with our other dinners.  The food was fresh, service was excellent as well as the local wines.","4590":"The water came out with stuff floating in it. It was blazing hot and there was no air conditioning. Flys were all over us. Had to leave.","4591":"The second visit was a bit disappointing because my fish was over cooked. I think their apps and small plates are worth while. Maybe next time we will do that and drinks only.","4592":"Large portions and good food is a dangerous proposition. The communal table is a great way to dine without reservations.","4593":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had. Every dish was exceptionally crafted with a medley of unique flavors, delicious, and generous portions made for sharing. We had the duck mouse pate, burratta and pear salad and half chicken with polenta. Great service and the decor is awesome. I got to eat sitting in the booth of 100 year old confession booth. I can easily say it was a devilshly sin free meal.","4594":"Ate in the patio on a warm summer night. Ambiance, food, drinks, service - everything was great! Looking forward to going back again.","4595":"The meal started with an incredible salt and vinegar popcorn; to die for. We absolutely loved the Brussel sprouts and Pimento cheese toast! Our server Cody went above and beyond to provide great service; one of the best servers we have ever had. We highly recommend going to The Lark if you are in Santa Barbara!","4596":"Are you looking for a a really good light dinner to end your day in Santa Barbara? Are you looking for some good outdoor seating to enjoy this dinner? Well, this place has your answer. We were on our way to Los Angeles and decided to stop in Santa Barbara to do some exploring. To finish the day, we got a light dinner at this place.\n\nWhen I walked inside, I felt like I was inside a really hip restaurant in Southern California. We got a small table at the patio, which was really nice even though there was no nice oceanic view. \n\nThe dishes we got were the Pork Shoulder Slider sandwiches, the Cured Salmon, and the Grilled Hangar Steak. The Sliders were excellent. The flavor of the sauce, combined with the tenderness of the pork and the soft chewy buns made this dish tasty and one of the most delicious pork sandwiches I have eaten. One dish of three sliders should be enough for a good lunch for a grown man. \n\nThe Cured Salmon is not a bad choice for a decent appetizer, the texture was very fresh, and the garnishes that came with it made it a very tasty light dish. As for the Hangar Steak, the beef had a nice tenderness and the flavor from the marinade and the broccoli was almost perfectly cooked and was a nice complement to the steak, making it an excellent dish.  \n\nService was great, the servers were very friendly and easy to talk to, and probably one of the best examples of friendly California hospitality. The location is excellent, not too far from the Stearn's Wharf area.\n\nOverall, I thought I had one of the best light dinners not only in Santa Barbara but in California so far. If you are looking for an excellent place to \"kick start\" your evening or end your day in Santa Barbara with a group of people, this place is a great choice for drinks or food. This place is probably one example that I have a lot of good hopes for Santa Barbara's food, despite Santa Barbara's distance from the major cities of California.","4597":"Went there for dinner with a small group and the setting was great. Lively atmosphere and the place was full. Drinks were great as well as the initial customer service. My complaint is how long it took for the food to come out after ordering. It is served family style so I understand things come out one at a time. My issue was that one of my main entrees took 20-25 minutes before it came out. I assumed the waiter didn't write it down. Then as we were ready to ask for our bill the plate came out. We noticed that we weren't the only table dealing with this issue. The food was decent but at those prices the plated were very small. I would return for cocktails and small plates.","4598":"Fantastic food. An explosion of flavors. We shared the crudo, goat confit and pappardelle and all were delicious and well made.\n\nThe service, however, left a lot to be desired. After 10 minutes at the table we only had water, and the water server can be best described as surly. After our first drink was long finished we had to flag down our waiter to order a second drink. It never came, despite a reminder, and our second and third plate were consumed without any wine. We had to stop two other people to bring us our drinks which they did with seemingly sarcastic fanfare.\n\nAt the top of the evening I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. The waiter made a note on the ticket, then promptly forgot.\n\nIn short, great food if you can handle the spotty service.","4599":"Don't know what all the buss is about. Their food is not that good. Oysters and hamachi crudo weren't really fresh. The oysters were very ocean-y tasting. Was really disappointed. Because our waitress was ok I'm giving it 2 stars.","4600":"Thee best restaurant in town!!! A must for any visitor of the SB area. I would go here every night if I could. Great management by the wonderful Wyatt, and superb cocktail creations from Kyle. The hostess are beautiful and the guys behind the bar (Jake, Mitch, and George) always have a cold one ready for you!","4601":"Really really good menu with lots of interesting choices, I've only ever sat at the community table because I've never thought ahead to make reservations (which you will definitely need if you want a table) but it was a really cool atmosphere. \n\nNot quite a 5 star because the prices are a little higher than they ought to be for the quality\/quantity ratio they give you, but a good place to try if you've tapped out all the other fine dining in town.","4602":"Great ambiance, terrible service. \nSeated at 6:30, advised we would need to leave the table by 8 for reservations. We were fine with that. \nSalad and first course were served efficiently, then nothing.  No 3rd course, no checking in on us, just nothing for over 40 minutes.  We finally flagged down our waiter, who said the pasta would \"be right out\" then came back to tell us it would be another 10 minutes.  This was at 7:45, 15 minutes before we had been advised to vacate the table. We cancelled the pasta order, paid the bill (they initially tried to charge us for the $30 pasta dish), and left.  We did get an apology from the manager, who wanted to blame the delay on a \"kitchen back-up\", but there was literally not one server who asked us if we needed anything.  The salad and foie gras we ate were good, but not excellent. Will not return, it does not even come close to the hype.","4603":"My taste buds have visited The Lark on several occasions. It wasn't until my last visit that I absolutely fell in love with their food. I had their prime rib an their charcuterie tray. Everything was to die for and definitely worth the price. It's pricey don't get me wrong but you definitely get what you pay for. #quality","4604":"Food is great. Sit at the bar for a drink or make a reservation and sit out on the patio. Great for date night or even a good place to take the whole family visiting Santa Barbara. The food is amazing. Plan to share. Don't forget to make a reservation!","4605":"We went to The Lark last night to celebrate our five year wedding anniversary and I have mixed feelings about it. The food and drinks were very good, and even exceeded my expectations. However, the service was definitely a little uneven. They didn't pace the drinks with the food well and didn't do a good job of clearing our (tiny) table when it needed it. Also the server inexplicably kept calling my husband and I \"fellas\", like \"how are we doing, fellas?\"  I think it might have been a translation thing but it just got bizarre after a while . Finally, they didn't even mention our anniversary, even though my husband made a point of letting the restaurant know when he made the reservation. Oh well! Three stars it is.","4606":"Really enjoyed this place. Restaurant vibe was bustling, cozy & rustic. The clams were the showstopper - very unexpected. Our waiter was spot on with his recommendations and very attentive.","4607":"As a foodie I can always count on the Lark to deliver perfection, intricacy, and deliciousness every time.  This past visit my server David gave incredible food suggestions and caring and friendly service.  Next time I go back I will be asking for him! So happy to find such great customer care in Santa Barbara","4608":"we really enjoyed this after spending the day on a wine tour in SB and returning hungry (and slightly tipsy) in search of dinner.  The outdoor seats on their patio are great, they keep a fire going so even on a chilly night it's very comfortable.  \n\nThe service was outstanding - even after our 5th request for more popcorn (the popcorn is AMAZING).  Our server guided us through the menu since were first-timers and gave us some pointers about how much to order since the menu is family style.  We ended up with the crispy brussel sprouts, the half chicken and the porkbelly.  Would definitely get everything again but want to try some new things next time.","4609":"Went last night with a group of 20. All I can say is that the food was less than ordinary and not at all appetizing. The saving grace is the amazing service. \n\nMy take on the food may be wrong, so give it a try. Many others have given amazing reviews.","4610":"Awful experience, awful staff, awful food.\n\nWent for dinner on a recent Wednesday night -- the place was half full.\u00a0 Ok, great!\u00a0 We have the pick of tables. \u00a0 Not.\n\nThe greeter placed us at worst table in the house, and provided some half-baked explanation that they were understaffed, and certain sections were closed off.\u00a0 We asked to be moved.\u00a0 Not -- again.\n\nThen \"Patrick\" -- the manager came out.\u00a0 He was completely officious, demeaning, and not interested in accommodating the customer.\u00a0 He then tried to immediately take our order, in particular the wine, after which I said \"we'll order wine with rest of our meal.\" \u00a0This did not sit well with Patrick, who insisted that the wine be ordered at that time.\u00a0 I refused and he left. \u00a0\n\nOn to the cuisine.\u00a0 I don't even know where to begin with this.\u00a0 There were SO many ingredients on each of the plates, that our heads were spinning.\u00a0 And in the end, completely unmemorable, other than the outrageous tab.\n\nThe wine list was short, expensive, and unimaginative -- considering the proximity to SB wine country.\n\nI don't know what the hype is of this place. \u00a0\n\nAvoid.","4611":"Gotta say that The Lark was a full dinning experience. My friend was able to customize a menu that the restaurant printed, 'Happy Birthday Ishita,' on. We dined family style, each able to taste 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 desserts. There were plenty of wine and drink options and the food was packed with flavor.\n\nOur party ate outside and despite that it was a chilly night, the heaters & fireplace coupled with the decore made for an awesome ambient experience. This night was jam packed with great company, great service and a great meal. I'd highly recommend.","4612":"I've been there a number of times (every SB visit) and it's always an excellent experience - I'm surprise it took this long To write a review. Everything from the ambiance, To the calm kitchen, to the drinks and exquisite food is an A++\n\nSome standout servers I've had are ian and bill... you truly elevate the dining experience! \n\nI alwAys go with a group of 4 or more and i love that every time i go I'm still able to try new dishes because of the changing menu, but always get to enjoy the Brussels. I typically LOVE all but 1 dish that we order, so i don't have a list of MUST DO items, because I'd be willing to bet you'll like anything on the menu. This last time i was a little hesitant about the beef cheek pappardelle but it turned out to be my favorite dish of the night. The chicken is always amazing and juicy! The late winter salad - woah! The popcorn - so simple yet amazing ... i could go on forever ! \n\nMy bfs mom was gifted the Lark cookbook and the night before we went in i was reading it and got even more excited about dinner - everything that goes into creating that heavenly food is over the top & so well thought out & love that Jason talked about his influences for the dishes\n\nThis was a late birthday dinner & they brought out some wonderful treats for us- like a lemon bite \n\nAlready can't wait for the next visit !","4613":"Went here last night for the first time and had a great experience. Everything was perfect from the food to the staff the cocktails and the service. We even brought our 6 year old who ate and enjoyed everything we ordered. The have a new goat pasta which is a must and the ribeye hit the ball outta the park. I had a spicy strawberry cocktail that I'm going to crave all the time now. What really put out the icing on the cake was our server Louie, he was helpful and professional. Being an incredibly hot day he made sure we constantly had ice on the table for our waters which was a nice touch to his service. Way to anticipate our needs! Lots of great places to eat in SB but the lark is a place we will return to!","4614":"I read the Yelp reviews for this place and I scratch my head.  This is the epitome of overrated restaurant.   I came here expecting a level of restaurant experience like the kind in LA... like Bestia, AOC or Lucques... good seasonal menu, well sourced ingredients and expertly prepared...  far from it. \n\nFirst things first.  The table water is Santa Barbara tap.  I live in Santa Barbara County and I know how bad the tap water here is.  You don't serve tap water at a place like this.   Please invest in a water delivery service or a reverse osmosis system.   \n\nService was very disorganized.  Our server(s) were fine but the one who served us was not the one assigned to us and kept apologizing for the other person.  \n\nFree Popcorn:  The best dish of the meal.  Pretty sad. \n\nPimento Cheese Toast:  I love pimento cheese and bemoan that you can't get Pimento Cheese in California.  This was the worst pimento cheese I've ever had.  The greens that topped it tasted like weeds that grow my garden.    \n\nGrilled Peach salad:  Peaches where not fully ripe and the grilling did nothing to the peach, it could've just been microwaved.   I've had such a salad like this and you really have to get good fruit and grill them correctly.  The heirloom tomatoes tasted grainy and mushy and didn't not have any good tomato flavor.   \n\nTagliatelle with Peas:  Good but it was too acidic.  Pasta was very good and well prepared and I loved the peas and pea greens.  After we finished it we found out why it was so good, there was a pool of about  1\/2 stick of melted butter.  This is just over compensation, chef's effort to elevate a mediocre dish.  If you add a stick of melted butter to Top Ramen of course it will be good.    \n\nRibs with potato salad:  The potato salad was overly acidic and clumsily prepared and ribs were under seasoned.  I had gone to Chili's not too long ago and had the baby back ribs and I kept thinking, these ribs are not as good as Chilis. \n\nCocktail:  I don't remember what it was but it tasted like the scented Christmas pine cones you get at Bed Bath and Beyond.  \n\nDessert:  Went to Yogurtland - best decision of the night.\n\nLastly, bathroom - it's shared with other restaurants in the area, why? It needs to be cleaned more often.  \n\nI question the management here.. they are obviously not seasoned restaurateurs and trying to recreate a certain LA restaurant vibe and experience.  They are failing.  Santa Barbara is full of mediocre restaurants and this is just another notch in the belt.","4615":"After strong recommendations, we were underwhelmed.   The hostess greeted us by trying to get us to accept a table in the back room with the other \"groups\" (likely large and noisy groups?) or on the patio (cold and rainy).  But when we said no, she seated us in the main dining room.  Maybe groups of 4 women don't get priority?   Food was largely good but not exceptional.  Hamachi was excellent as was the pasta.    Mary's chicken was meh.  Food was brought by different people each time and none of them brought proper serving utensils.   Waiter rarely checked in so we ended up skipping the bottle of wine we selected as well as dessert.  Very young, very hip crowd may not share our expectations.   Try Barbare\u00f1o instead.","4616":"I finally see what all the hype is about, I can't believe it took me so long to go and I will definitely not wait so long to go back! The atmosphere is great. The brussel sprouts, the chicken, the beef cheek and the Oysters- ALL DELISH. The wine was amazing too, but unfortunately we had so much of it I can't recall what it was called! It was a lime kiln valley pinot I believe, and so very good. And the server, though new, was charming and very good at his job already. Well done Lark!","4617":"My wife and i have been to the Lark several times and enjoyed the food and ambiance. However something has changed since we last went there to eat. The service was horrible and the food marginally palatable. We had decided the it was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary but once there regretted the choice.  Unfortunately, they have lost my future business and any recommendation to others who dine in SB.","4618":"Everything we had was delicious. Food was beautifully presented. Excellent and interesting flavors, great service. Atmosphere and decor was awesome and fun to look at. So lively. We had our kids with us and they were accommodating and sitting it the booth made them easy to control in the restaurant. Drinks were delicious, and overall I would say the prices were pretty reasonable for the experience and the quantity. Couldn't recommend this place more. Will definitely go back when i'm in SB.","4619":"My wife and I dined here last night for our 1 year wedding anniversary. We made an 8:00pm reservation and arrived on the dot. Overall i thought it was just fine\/average. I know its not fine dinning but based on the hype, reading up on the chefs bios, and reading up on the menu prior to dining i was definitely expecting more. \n\nThey started us off with their poppyseed popcorn and then we ordered the spiced nuts, summer pasta, grilled loch etive steelhead trout, grilled hangar steak, and the tres leches cake. I do enjoy mezcal so was excited to try the \"pistol pete\" cocktail but was informed they were out. I settled for the paloma which was good. \n\nReally nothing stood out to me except maybe the hangar steak. I'd say was the best dish we ordered. The trout had good flavor but was overcooked so it was quite \"fibery\" and didnt slide apart.\n\nService was good, no complaints there. I believe our servers name was Oscar. He did a fine job.\n\nOne thing i would like to bring up is that we sat at the table closest to the door on the right side. Once the sun went down it was extremely dark. Im all for mood lighting but this was beyond that. There was a yellow light near the door that did cast a pleasant light on the table but was turned off during our meal. At that point i could not really see much color at all of my food. I almost wasn't sure what i was eating as all the different vegetables and sauces sorta blended together on my plate. I thought it was quite unusual how dark it was. I've never dined anywhere that was so dark.\n\nI really give 2.5 stars but yelp only lets you do 2 or 3 so thats why i gave 2.\nIf the fish was cooked better and if it wasn't so dark i would give them 3 stars. \n\nI understand places run out of stuff so i don't hold running out of one of their specialty cocktails against them. That doesn't affect my rating. But it might be nice to consider saving a few knowing you have blocks of reservations coming in at 8:00,8:15,8:30,8:45,9:00\n\nWould i go back? No\nCould i recommend it? No\nDo i regret going? Almost, but no, i don't regret it.","4620":"The food here is simply amazing! If you were not a fan of brussel sprouts before you got here, you will be when you leave (they are a must). When you sit at the bar you are delighted when the bartender hands you a basket of popcorn with fresh herbs. I cannot find words that can explain the taste of the popcorn...it's just AMAZING. Their handcrafted cocktails are tasty and all you need is one. Try the Maduro Margarita, you won't be disappointed.","4621":"I think I ordered the wrong things and spent a lot of money doing that. So it was an unpleasant eating experience. The duck wing and the lamb rib are too sweet for me. It is also too much for two girls. The dessert is ok.","4622":"HATE TO LOVE THIS PLACE. They sat us down, gave us water and popcorn and then FORGOT ABOUT US FOR 45 MINUTES. We tried to tell one of the staff members, I saw them tell our \"waiter\" and still no one came to get our drink orders or meal orders. So again, I caught a different persons attention and I guess this person actually cared about the fact that we were waiting there hungry and drinkless. The Lark should be embarrassed that their wait staff knew we were not being attended and did nothing about it. They had a lot of managers walking around. You're telling me not one of them saw us sitting there with nothing on our table? This shouldn't happen at any restaurant--especially a restaurant of this caliber. I'm sure it was a fluke, but there's really no excuse for it. \n\nThey graciously paid for our drinks and appetizer. The food was delicious. I wish it wasn't because it's going to be difficult to come back here because of the other aspects of the dining experience.","4623":"I don't know...I didn't like this place as much as the other reviewers. I did some research of places to see and restaurants to eat before coming to SB. This place was highly rated. We were looking forward to trying it out. The food was good but it wasn't wow I definitely need to come back. The ambiance is hipster, modern, festive, a bit romantic, and cozy. The service was attentive. For food, we ordered the brussel sprouts, lamb ribs, pork belly, and deviled eggs. Everything tasted good but just not spectacular. It was a bit pricey","4624":"i have nothing but good to say about the lark and the wine bistro behind.... we arrived a little early for our dinner reservation so we sat at the bar at les marchands for a delightful, refreshing glass of wine. wonderful environment! we moved over to the lark where we sat a a booth where we could see all that was going on. we had such great service. the food kept coming, and it amazed me;  each dish served at the table got better and better (and it wasn't because of the moscow mules consumed). our party decided to share all the dishes we ordered. we started with the charcuterie plate, pork belly sliders, little gem wedge, the beet salad along with the fried olives. we moved onto the marys roasted chicken - so moist and simple yet flavorful. each dish came out at the perfect time, and each dish was more and more exceptional.  i just might have to go back for the desserts!!!  the milk chocolate pot de creme (an absolute, even if you are not a dessert person),  the cheesecake, black sesame dacquoise, and ice cream sandwich - we did share all of those with coffee. a great ending!\ni can't get back soon enough. time to make another reservation!! thank you for such a wonderful evening!\nps...i had to go back the next morning to the lucky penny for a warm scone and latte! perfection!","4625":"ni ce decor and service, willing to try it again but it seems everything had some sort of chile in it. I could not get away from the chiles.  Started with a charcuterie tray which was good but even the head cheese had large chunks of red hot chili peppers. The dugness crab gnocchi was described as having jalapeno in it. They brought it out without the jalapenos but the heavy creamy sauce was laden with cumin which covered up the flavor of the crab. We had the fish of the day which was also heavily spiced with cumin. If I had known both dishes were so heavy handed with cumin I would haved changed one of the dishes.  our waitress was nice and informatice and she said she would act as our consuktant.  If I was in her shoes I would have mentioned the repetitive taste profilesDescribed on the menu","4626":"Hands down one of the best places we've gone to. Had an amazing feast with great wine. Found a great bartender who treated us extremely valuable, thanks Andrew. Had the Lamb short ribs, to die for, and was surprised by the sheer beauty and presentation. Must go to place in beautiful Santa Barbara!!!","4627":"Very much the \"in\" place this year.  Good food - plan on sharing, a la tapas.  Noisy and crowded.  The problem?  The prices!\n\nDrinks are $12 and up.  Wine per glass starts in the same range.  Wine per bottle is $50 to start.  Beers are $7 and up.  12 ounce NY steak $48.   You get the idea.\n\nBring your parents' credit card and have a great time!","4628":"love the food and the space, very hip, working a Pacific North West Vide. Service has always been terrific.  Definitely an upmarket spot.  Good\/interesting cocktail menu and great wine selection. The outside chairs are not very comfortable,I am tall (5'11\") the seat angles back puts me in an not very comfortable position.  Inside seating is fine. Although, I am not sure why they allow baby strollers the size Volkswagons inside, the waitstaff has to dodge and weave to do their jobs. I see this as a safety issue for staff as well as customers.","4629":"Freddie was very personable and accommodating.  He took the time to explain his work.  He was even very careful with the Bartlett truck on our narrow street.","4630":"The Funk Zone is really cool spot in SB where you can find unique foodie spots. The Lark was on my list of must-try spots in the area and I was excited to visit. We came for an early dinner last Thursday and were able to sit on the patio right next to the fire. There were plenty of heaters outside which kept us toasty while enjoying the ambience. \n\nService was really cheery and fantastic. They brought over some complimentary popcorn which was quite tasty. Their cocktail list was creative, so be sure to check that out. I tried the rum based East Beach (and I could have drank a punch bowl of this!) The Old Fashioned was really great as well. We decided to share the brussel sprouts and the half roasted chicken, since this was something people had raved about. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it!\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the saffron ice cream sandwich. Just order this! It was so creative and tasty. The atmosphere was spectacular, service was amazing and the food was out of this world. Please DO check this place out when you're in the area.","4631":"Amazing service. For such a busy large place everyone was awesome. Brussels were awesome as was the hanger steak.  Only reason 4 stars was the pork belly dish was tiny and one of the pieces was 100% fat. Great pot de creme.  Would give 4.5 if I could.","4632":"Great place,food and service.This place is delicious,this place is amazing,the decor is wonderful,location too,it is at Funk Zone,the best wine tasting in Santa Barbara.","4633":"I had looked at the menu online and was stoked to see a cheese board item. My bestfriend and I went that same day and ordered it.. it was a disgrace to cheese lover's everywhere. For $15, they give you 3 types of cheese and these gross graham crackers. It's a cool spot with a great vibe so I can only hope they step their cheese game up so I can come back.","4634":"The food overall was good and satisfying.  Their menu has moderate creativity and fun choices that are different.  This makes this place fun to go to.  (3.5 stars)\n\nThe service was unfortunately poor.  The server was kind when we interacted, however the service itself was poor.  There were couple of times I needed some service and I couldn't flag down my server.  I also noticed that the servers were talking and laughing, so I asked the bus-boy for help.  (1 Star - based on the pricing scale)\n\nSounds like a common experience for those that didn't give high reviews.\n\nSometimes, the food is good enough to compensate the lack in service.  However, in most cases, the service can diminish the value of the food (almost completely).  The opposite works as well, where the service can compensate a lesser food experience.","4635":"The lark surpassed my already high expectations. Easily the best restaurant in town. Phenomenal food and top notch service - our waitress Chelsea had great recommendation and provided Michelin star service.  Popcorn is amazing, loved the Brussel sprouts and pork belly and lamb ribs too. Hubby loved the crab risotto. Cheese Plate and peach cobbler were good - would get again but the star of the show was the entrees. I'm already begging my husband to go back! Get a signed cookbook for $35","4636":"Wow!  The most amazing South by SoCal  cuisine!! The grits and chicken with smoked ham hocks are completely amazing! ! And I'm from new Orleans; )","4637":"Busy restaurant with knowledgable wait staff. Just slightly understaffed. Especially when it came to getting our cocktails coming from the busy bar. The food was tasty. We had the brussel sprouts, oysters, beet and burata salad, a pasta dish, and shrimp. Nothing I would come back again for though as nothing really was amazing. However the cocktails especially their Stagecoach whiskey concoction was fabulous. I may come back for that and an appetizer although the place is incredibly busy and just stopping in for a drink and appetizer without a reservation would be a gamble. Enjoyed the experience though.","4638":"We ate at The Lark last night while visiting the area on a weekend get-away. We had reservations which was a good move because the place was full and were seated promptly. Our server took good care of us, providing an explanation of the family style serving and the breakdown of the menu suggesting 2-3 dishes per person. We settled on 3 total plus dessert which was just right, anything more would have been too much food. \n\nThe brussel sprouts were excellent, the roasted zucchini was just ok but featured flavors that were new to us which was a plus. We chose the flat iron steak for our main which was very good and for our dessert we had the praline ice cream sandwich, delicious!\n\nGreat atmosphere and fun location for a night out on the town in the Funk Zone.","4639":"Super friendly service.\n\nWe got the deviled eggs, Brussel sprouts, Belgian waffles with duck liver and hangar steak.\n\nThe stand out dish dish was the waffles with duck liver - really creative and tasty!","4640":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this restaurant where all the food was middle of the road and very eclectic it was very small on the portions and the flavors were on them just OK they were not outstanding or very exotic. The wine list was very difficult to find a wine that was rich everything was lean and austier and many of the wines were from Europe and the central coast and very small unheard of wineries we tasted through many wines to try to just find a glass of wine to drink and then finally ordered off the by the bottle menu and the bottle we ordered was still somewhat time middle of the road. In addition it was the the middle of winter and they had all the doors open in the entire room  it was extremely windy and raining and I'm not sure what kind of affect or feeling they were trying to go for the restaurant but it was absolutely freezing cold everybody was wearing their jackets and I don't really think that the managers understand that people sitting down eating dinner don't want to be freezing their asses off. In my opinion the restaurant highly overrated and not worth the hype.","4641":"Food was good. Brussels Sprouts yummy, Duck Wings really good and Couscous yummy. Service fell short. Although not that unusually busy server was okay. Took 15min after drinks were received for ordering, after waiving down server. Wings and Couscous were brought 30min apart after second reminder couscous had not been received. Seems like kitchen forgot to make order not sure. Also was there for a birthday celebration and no acknowledgment whatsoever. Only time server seemed remotely interested was when he presented the check and was then peppy. Maybe an off night for the server and kitchen but after heading to San Diego and dining at Juniper & Ivy the next evening which was just absolutely amazing both in service and in the menu taste, I realized Lark is just okay. Next time in SB I'll hit the microbrewery that serves these amazing hamburgers instead and save my time and money for something like Juniper and Ivy in SD.","4642":"What an amazing place!  Decor is very well done, the staff is knowledgeable and delightful.  And the food!!!  Bone marrow crusted beef cheeks and the wedge salad were to die for.  Highly recommend it for a fun atmosphere and food you know is going to be astonishing.","4643":"Food alone would warrant five stars.  Everything was outstanding, although my wife didn't like the pimento cheese - specifically the shredded parm within.  That said, everything else - including the starter popcorn was near flawless.\n\nIt's a really great setting, nicely finished, and in a great part of SB, so there are lots of places to go and lots to do before and after.\n\nThe server was really knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  She offered some really great insights, asked about allergies, and helped us pare down our choices.  \n\nThe only issue we had was that we were rushed - which was additionally perplexing because while being a Saturday, the place was only two-thirds full by the time we left at 8 p.m. Maybe they were overstaffed for the number of covers who ultimately came in, so perhaps it was more a case of being over-attentive, but the pace on our meal left us wanting more time between to enjoy our drinks, soak in the atmosphere, and have a relaxed experience.","4644":"THE RAINBOW CARROTS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!! i tried to re-create them at home the next day for dinner. i like to think of myself as a pretty good cook, and while they were good, they were nothing compared to the carrots at the Lark. if i wanted to impress a bunch of people at a potluck, i would order a catering-sized platter of the carrots and pretend that i made them. just kidding :P i wouldn't do that. but i won't deny that the idea crossed my mind -- that's how good they were! \n\nthe brussels sprouts were also amazing. you cannot go to the Lark and skip the sprouts or the carrots. trust me -- it will make the world of a difference in your experience. we also tried the yellowtail and the lamb. they were good but didn't leave nearly as much of an impression as the two sides, which simply stole the show. the sprouts were crisped and seasoned to perfection. the carrots were soft, warm, served with whipped feta cheese, and topped with the perfect combination of spices, herbs, and honey. my mouth is watering just thinking about them!","4645":"Make sure you make a reservation for this place! My husband and I went here for his birthday. When I made the reservation I mentioned that we were celebrating his birthday and when we were seated at the table there was a postcard wishing him a Happy Birthday. Very simple, but we liked the detail. We ordered the charcuterie board, little gems wedge, and marinated & grilled hangar steak. The charcuterie board had a nice variety of meats and we thoroughly enjoyed the pickled veggies. The bacon and and pecans on the wedge were absolutely wonderful. Our main dish, the hangar steak was cooked medium rare (just the way we liked it) and the flavor was outstanding. Our dinner exceeded our expectations, then it was time for dessert. The server brought out mascarpone cheesecake profiteroles, which basically were little balls of heaven. My husband doesn't even like cheesecake, but he loved this dessert. All in all, the food was tasty, service was exceptional and the ambiance was very romantic.","4646":"The best lamb I have ever had in my life. I can not speak more highly of this place. The flavor profiles were amazing and complex but not pretentious. The price was right!!","4647":"We went to The Lark with high expectations based on all the Reviews- 2\/27\/15.\nComing from South Orange County, CA, we have a ton of great restaurants here.  Not sure what the big deal is on the Brussels Sprouts and Deviled Eggs.  We ordered like 6-7 dishes for a party of six and shared all.  It was cold outside-supposed to rain- and we had called and made reservations and they would not accommodate us inside.\nWe were seated right by the front door for our Birthday.  Overall, I would check out the location and decide if that's what you are looking for.  Probably, not go there again.  Our waiter was Awesome, I will say that.  The food was so, so overall.","4648":"Food and service were just OK.  Each dish missed the mark. Bad suggestions from the waiter.","4649":"We had an amazing meal, the cocktails were delicious and the staff were attentive but not overbearing...The ambiance is amazing.  We will definitely be back here many times in the future. Reservations are highly recommended but we sat at the bar and has wonderful service as well!","4650":"Me and my boyfriend went for a weekend trip to Santa Barbara and this restaurant was recommended by one of our close friends. Everything went well from our appetizers to drinks. But our pasta dish never came out. It has been 45 minutes and we asked our waiter about it and she said their food is served by every course that's why it we havnt received it. We were still unsure but OK whatever we gave her the benefit of the doubt and we waited another 30 minutes and it still never came out. We gave up and asked for our check and all of a sudden the manager came to our table and started apologizing. We expect to not be charged with drinks and should be compensated by the manager. But instead he just said sorry and still billed us with $100 that's not even worth it. Don't ever come here!!! They have the worst service and undertrained staff. I'm never coming here again and I will spread the news.","4651":"Very mediocre. We visited Santa Barbara on our road trip from SF to LA, and really wanted to like The Lark since it came highly recommended by our airbnb hosts and reviews were stellar on Yelp. The place and ambiance was nice, very warm and contemporary. But the food really disappointed us. The ingredients were fresh, but the flavors of each dish were messy and clashing. We had the Hamachi Crudo ($20), Brussel Sprouts ($10), Pork Belly ($18), and Persimmon and Burrata ($13). All the dishes had a really similar theme -- they all tasted kinda sweet and fruity, but nothing popped. The flavors also overpowered each other, you couldn't really taste the pork or hamachi or burrata, they were all buried under other overly flowery ingredients. Food was too try-hard, and disappointing. While a lot of effort was made into presentation, I would have preferred a simpler offering that paid more attention to taste.","4652":"I've been to The Lark before, but our most recent visit was wonderful. I was with a small group of ladies for a bachelorette weekend and we sat at the bar. Kyle was our gracious server and was extremely attentive. He explained with finesse both the food and the drinks and we had a great time in his company. \nThe food just kept getting better as the night went on. Their complimentary popcorn is always a treat. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and the tomato panzanella for first course and enjoyed the crab risotto as an entree. The Lark is beautifully decorated with an excellent ambiance. I would highly recommend it on your visit to the funk zone.","4653":"Great food, cocktails, and atmosphere. One of our favorite places in SB. If you have only one dinner out in SB...go to Lark.","4654":"Dinner last night was wonderful. Deviled eggs were a perfect bite to start off the meal. Little gem salad & smoked persimmon & burrata salad were both beautiful and bursting with flavor and texture. Strozzapretti with goat confit (yes GOAT confit) was unctuous, meaty and creamy. Just those 3 were plenty of food for 2 to share. Honey Cremeux dessert was nice too. The Mule was great and on the mark, my Continental cocktail was a little overdone on the ardbeg. Good attentive service. We had to wait maybe 5-10 min for out reso, and it was crowded but not bad. Bottom line: inventive (but not precious) family style food and would love to return soon.","4655":"What a unique dinning experience.   They start you off with popcorn that will leaving you wanting more.  The chef uses great combination of flavors that allows you to try things that you never thought of.  We had the Brussel sprouts wedge salad and pork chop.  Will definitely be every time we are in Santa Barbara.","4656":"I had an amazing dinner here the other night!  We started off with a delicious squash\/burrata\/tomato salad ( can't remember the name),then had the deviled eggs, fried olives, scallops, pork shank and branzino. Every dish was AMAZING. Finished off the meal with the chocolatey pot de creme dessert. I can't wait to come back! I highly recommend making a reservation. We waited quite awhile on a Sunday night to be seated.","4657":"Everything was good and well cooked but the overall dishes lacked of harmony for some reason. The place is beautiful and staff very friendly. \nThe Duck liver mousse and the Goat cheese profiteroles were the best dishes we tried. The Pork belly and pig hears was really too sweet. The pig ears were delicious and the pork belly was really well prepared but the overall dishes was too sweet and I didn't get the logic of it. The Lamb ribs was really similar to the pork belly which I wish we were told when ordering. Nice place but wouldn't advise or go back.","4658":"The only reason this restaurant is popular is because Santa Barbara has very few places to choose from. Unfortunately, the cost to bring in good chefs are evident as you dine here and help but notice that there's more happening at the bar than at the tables:\/(","4659":"The Lark is the best restaurant in Santa Barbara in my opinion. It's on the fancy side, so if you're looking for something more casual you should look for another place. However, they are perfect for a special occasion and have the best food, plus a really great Atmosphere.","4660":"6 for 6! Despite dining at the most crowded times, we've never had one glitch and were fortunate to get patio seating. Consistently superb; fabulous dishes, beautiful presentation and an efficient, knowledgeable staff. Each visit we make a point of ordering something new, but the hanger steak is a \"must\" for us.","4661":"Lots of Noise, Lots of Salt, Lots of Spice\n\nThis is a very happening kind of place, so it is crowded and noisy.    We were seated right away and the service was pretty good.   The waiter helped us select an nice bottle of Pinot, and it was great.   But neither of us liked the food very much.     The scollop dish was ok, but nothing to really special.   It had a crab base, with grapefruit that just did not work.   The pimento cheese jar was too spicy to enjoy and the salmon rillet dish was served with chips that were so salty the whole dish was ineatable.   The menu changes all the time, so I know others have had better luck, but we won't return.","4662":"Eclectic restaurant with delicious food! Our party of 6 didn't have a reservation and we were lucky enough to get a communal table! The Brussels sprouts and pork belly was my personal favorite ! The server was very knowledgable and provided great recommendations! Definitely coming here again!!","4663":"I have to recognize Wyatt, one of the amazing bartenders the night I was there (which happened to be Christmas Eve). He embodied a rare sense of loving his job and it made my night a lot better. It was fun to watch him work--while carefully mixing drinks nonstop, he had full-fledged conversations with other guests at the bar, gave menu recommendations, joked with his colleagues, and seemed to keep an all-seeing eye on how the whole restaurant was running (asking servers to check various tables, expertly delegating to others behind the bar when he needed an extra hand). I have very limited experience in restaurant service, but he was brilliant and clearly has a bright future in the hospitality biz if that's the path he means to take.\n\nThe food's expensive, but my meal was tasty. Brussels sprouts with a sort of Vietnamese preparation (fish sauce, lime juice) were addictive. It's a shame that even the half-portion of chicken is meant for 2-3 people--I would have loved to try it.","4664":"By far my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara (and I grew up here - every time I come back home to visit, I make it a mission to go to all of my old favorites and try a few new ones). I've been here multiple times and have always had a great meal and overall lovely dining experience. I can't get enough of the olives, deviled eggs and brussel sprouts - all amazing! Highly recommend for groups and also for dates. Make sure you come with people that like food - picky eaters may spoil it for everyone.","4665":"Had dinner here because there's a lot of hype and had to try. It is over rated in my book. We had the popular brussel sprouts 3\/5, oysters 5\/5, quail 5\/5, pappardelle 1\/5. Pappardelle had too much truffle sauce and was very rich. Brussels were mediocre. Oysters and quail were the best dishes of the night. Service 3\/5 - our server was very nice, but things were forgot and they are all running around like a madhouse. Cheers","4666":"This is a classic example of a place that is really trying to be something special but over flavors and tries too hard.  We ordered the oysters and they came out frozen and the flavors didn't go well together. We complained and the bartender and manager came out with an attitude like we didn't know what good food taste like. We are happy to pay for a great experience and amazing food. This place just didn't have that. \n\nService was ok. Food was nothing special for the price. Pretentious environment, overpriced and overall mediocre. \n\nSave your money and go to Sama Sama, next door to Les Marchands or Olio. \n\nCocktails were really good, ambiance is hip\/modern. So for that reason 2 stars.","4667":"Went there last night and the food and scene were great! Reminds me of the hip Pearl District restaurants in Portland where I also live - definitely time for Santa Barbara to have a place like this. \n\nIt was packed but we received excellent food and friendly attentive service so the kitchen is up and running smoothly even though they're new. \n\nHad the heirloom salad (best ever) and split the very tasty half chicken with my husband which was still plenty of food. Being beer lovers, we also appreciated their on tap Figueroa IPA (whose new brewpub next door was also hopping). We'll be back soon.","4668":"A foodies delight. Innovative and creative dishes. Masters at work. Not all dishes were perfect. However, when you expect the best, you get picky. Very friendly service. Great decor. Truly part of funk zone. One seat at our table was part of a confessional. The heirloom tomato salad and crab gnocchi were are favorites. Tips - be hungry. The dishes are to share. Pace it. They ask that you order all at the same time. Like most American restaurants, the dishes were coming too fast. Wasn't done with one before the next arrived. Felted rushed. We had to ask them to slow it down.","4669":"Every dish we had was excellent! And we enjoyed sitting outside under the twinkle lights and heaters. We ordered:\n-pimento cheese toast (9\/10)\n-agnolotti pasta (8\/10)\n-pork belly (10\/10): this blew me away and I don't ever order pork belly\n-ice cream sandwich (9\/10)\n\nOur waitress was great as well. I highly recommend a stop at The Lark. Oh and they offer complimentary valet as well.","4670":"The ambiance of the restaurant is quaint and intimate and cozy. Patio had plenty of heaters to keep everyone toasty. The food was perfection. First off, the popcorn with sage and pepper and salt was addictive. The pumpkin spice with ice cream dessert was the perfect size for 4 to share. \nTuna, scallops, tomato salad and roasted pig toast with smoked tomatoes and creamy cheese  was all spot on.  My only complaint might be that when I go for just a romantic evening with just one person, we won't get to try so many dishes because they are well portioned. Too many delicious choices. JP has a wonderful menu.","4671":"Spent my birthday here. The staff made me feel so special. The effort put forth to create a memorable experience is very well executed. The attention to detail and the connection the staff makes with its patrons is sadly unusual. It's not just the meal, it's the experience as a whole that deserve recognition. It's also refreshing to see the management staff making an effort to be on the floor. I lost count of how many staff members asked about my experience. And they seemed to really want to know.\nThe food portions are more than generous. Entrees are for sharing. The choices the chefs make are unique and interesting. Simple but complex at the same time. There are just a handful of choices but each one a beautifully done. \nThe design of the space is spectacular. Surprising little things stashed here and there. Interesting pieces collected and displayed. It has the clean simplicity of a modern space filled with warm and rustic accents. \n\nTry...\nFried olives with chorizo\nMediterranean see bass\nSmoked pork shank\nMeyer lemon tart\nThe mule!!!","4672":"It's very rare that I am impressed from a dining experience and its even more rare that I write a review on a place. However, after dining at The Lark tonight I felt compelled to write a review. The restaurant was outstanding in all aspects. The ambiance, service, taste of the food, and presentation was outstanding and far beyond what I expected. \nWe started with the Brussels sprouts with dates... Then had the half chicken and the flat iron steak. Then finished it off with the mascarpone profiteroles with blueberry compote. Portions were huge and prices were very reasonable. Overall it was a great time tonight. I would definitely suggest that anyone visiting Santa Barbara make a reservation for dinner at The Lark.","4673":"Found this gem online to conclude our 2000 mile culinary tour of California.  (Our go to restaurant San Ysidro Ranch is closed) Thier exciting and original cocktail menu enticed us to try it.  This is a large restaurant but somehow the staff makes you feel warmly cared for. They have a huge patio with outdoor seating and a great evening atmosphere.  We loved the creative cuisine menu and locally sourced farm to table style.  This chef is doin it right.  Highly recommended for large venue places.","4674":"Delicious food (as always), terrible service...\nThe Lark has great food served family style.  You'll be asked to put in your full order (which will likely be at least 4 dishes) at the start of the dining experience....but don't be fooled you when your server says he\/she will \"pace out\" your dishes.   \n\nWe went with another couple, and ordered 6 dishes.  Two came out before our drinks arrived,  and 3 more came out within 10 minutes.  We had to send one back to the kitchen, because there wasn't even room on the table, and we asked the busboy to slow down on the delivery.   \n\nIn addition, we had to ask for our drinks 2 times before they finally arrived; our server stated \"it's Saturday night, and we're a little backed up\"....Well, shouldn't the restaurant have figured out it should staff appropriately on busy evenings?\n\nAlso, a gentleman in our party asked for salt, which never came.  We had to ask a total of three times before it was finally brought to the table.\n\nAs so many dishes were served as once, our plates got quite dirty.  Twice we had to ask for clean plates. \n\nNot once did our server come to check on us during the meal.\n\nIt is clear that this restaurant, since it is so popular, is trying to turn over tables at a fast pace; quite frankly they should show more respect to their patrons.  As mentioned before, the food is very good, but plan ahead on a strategy to ensure a quality dining experience.","4675":"We arrived at 6pm on a friday night and sat at the communal table in the bar.  The restaurant was packed, however seats at the table turned over quickly.  We started with the deviled eggs, they were good.  Next the stone fruit with burrata, this dish is one of the best things I've ever eaten, very sweet and fantastic.  Next was the roasted asparagus, perfectly cooked and delicious.  Next was the Caramelized Shrimp with Clams, the seafood was yucky, caramelized meant crunchy, an attached leg and fishy, there were 5 clams on the plate 4 were good and 1 was bad, the pureed potato and spring onion were the stars of the plate.  Our final dish was the short rib, it was good just not my style, it was cooked like tri tip, lots of burnt crust on the edges, the tomatillo sauce, squash and dried sunchokes were fantastic so I still felt it was a good dish.  Our waiter was great very easy going and attentive.  The food runners seemed either bored or overwhelmed as they rushed through their script and did not pause to make sure we had proper utensils.  The farm to table concept was done well.","4676":"Amazing experience even though it was crowded, we got seated quickly and had great service and suggestions. Food was amazing and beautifully presented. Want to go back!","4677":"Great strong cocktail drink!! I ordered the mule and it was perfect strength of alcohol with fresh flavors. Also, must get the Brussel sprouts!","4678":"My first critical review. I understand taste is subjective, and that I may have been there on an off night, but I hope some of this feedback gets back to management.\n\nService:\n\nShowed up 10 minutes before my reservation, wasn't seated for 25 minutes. Watched two couples who arrived after us get seated before. Once I was seated, I received a phone call about 10 minutes into my meal telling me that they were ready to seat us. So the takeaway is that this is one of those places where a reservation is just to pull you in the door if you don't feel like waiting, or that they were particularly disorganized this Saturday night. \n\nWaiter was not helpful. Received 3 dishes I did not enjoy. At the first instance, she asked how it was as we had just begun. I told her we did not enjoy the dish (oysters) due to an odd, off putting grapefruit flavored ice that was melting into the oyster. Her response was to \"just scrape it off.\" No better way to please customers than charge 20$ for something they don't want to eat. And of course she started waiting until after we were done with the dish to ask us how it was.\n\nFood:\n\nOysters were practically inedible due to the odd grapefruit flavored shaved ice topping. If you order this, get it with the topping on the side, or better yet, without it.\n\nPorchetta was non offensive, but bland. Burrata was fresh atleast. \n\nSea bass was extremely over salted. The fish itself and the vegetables were fresh, but the sauce was really unbearably salty.\n\nThe scallop dish was overly salted as well, and came with a mix of vegetables on an odd sauce with seemingly random flavors thrown together. I think there was mint jelly in it? Why? We really had to force ourselves to finish this one so we wouldn't have to leave hungry.\n\n1 star for ambiance and decor of the restaurant, 1 star for letting me use the bathroom once when they were closed and I was eating next door at lucky penny.\n\nWill not be back.","4679":"Great spot! The dishes here are meant to be shared family-style, so you can try a lot of different dishes. Our waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person, which in our opinion is wayyyy too much. We ordered 5 dishes total and left almost the entire last dish untouched.\n\nThere was definitely an Asian-inspired theme to many of the dishes\n\n0. Seasoned popcorn came out first in lieu of bread. Super yummy, but popcorn always always always gets stuck in my gums, so I couldn't enjoy too much! \n1. Hamachi crudo - so good! Fresh with good flavor and a mix of textures\n2. Brussels sprouts - braised in fish sauce. Little on the salty side for me, and fish sauce is the sauce of my people!\n3. Beet salad - fresh, high quality ingredients\n4. Snapper - thai-inspired curry. Really yummy and great quality fish\n5. Lamb w\/ hand-rolled pappardelle - great pasta, perfectly cooked. Lamb was delicious, tender, and not at all gamey\n\nCocktails were also delicious!\n\nService was perfect. Such a great atmosphere. Dark, hip, with awesome lights. There were a LOT of people at the bar on a Friday night, not sure if they were there just to have drinks at the bar of they were all having drinks waiting for a table or a bar seat. Bathroom is shared with Les Marchands next door!","4680":"um YUMMM! This place is absolutely amazing. From food to service to environment, I always have such a great experience here. Do yourself a favor and always start with the crispy brussel sprouts, I have never found ones that compare. I would go to lark just for brussels and a drink. I always enjoy JP's Paloma, but definitely like to adventure into their other craft cocktails. They are so methodically thought out and innovative. I could go on and on about dishes but lastly I will say, order the scallops!! So. Freaking. Good. Cooked perfectly. I love to entertain friends and family at the lark and love the continuous changes to the menu as the season changes. Will be back soon!","4681":"My husband and I had such a wonderful time at The Lark.  We had the Brussel sprouts, crackling chicken skins and the Waygu platter.  It's a family style menu so there is definitely enough food for all.  We were celebrating our Anniversary and what a fun and unique place to do it.  The food, ambiance and decor were wonderful, the staff was wonderful and we wanted to give a shout out to Nick the Bartender.  He was very courteous and thoughtful, actually taking the time to chat briefly with us about our special celebration.  Cheers to Nick and The Lark!","4682":"First, the vibe of this place is great, the back bar, outdoor area, and inside are all upbeat but not too loud or overwhelming.  The place was packed when we went on a Wednesday evening.\n\nThe food all sounded really good on the menu, but some of the dishes had an unnecessary amount of spice.  When you have ingredients that good, why cover them up?  The only thing I thought was really perfect (and I can't believe I am saying this about a salad, but this is far more than a salad) was the little gem \"wedge.\"  Just everything about that salad is perfect, I can still taste all the flavors and fattiness from the bacon.  \n\nWe also ordered WAY too much food at the waitress's advice.  The portions are large and it would have helped if she had let us know that.  We really liked her otherwise, but it was to the point where we actually barely made it to the chicken course (had to take most of it home) and certainly did not get to dessert.  \n\nIf I could do it again, which hopefully I will next time in SB, I would stick to: the wedge, the gnocchi (with less spice so I could taste the dungeness + corn), and the half chicken, (and hopefully dessert!).  My husband and I are reasonably hearty eaters at restaurants, and I think that would have been more than enough.","4683":"We dined here on a Saturday evening and had a very pleasant dinner in the outside seating area with a fire pit and all. The Lark is located in the \"Funk Zone\" and had a very lively environment. The space itself is pretty large and had plenty of seating, although, making a reservation is strongly encouraged, otherwise you can wait for a communal table. Our server was friendly and explained how their menu worked and recommended how many dishes each person should order. I will say that the food highlight of our meal was the pimento cheese and grilled bread. The pimento cheese was rich, smoky, and the perfect amount of spicy. The rest of the items we ordered, while presented very well, didn't do much for me in terms of flavor. We ordered the scallops which sweet and perfectly cooked, but they sat atop kaffir lime risotto which was so strong it overpowered the taste of everything on the plate and made it all inedible. I wish the scallops would have come plain because they were perfect on their own. Next we ordered the gnocchi and dungeness crab. A very rich dish. Very generous with the crab portion, but the gnocchi and the cream were just too rich and I needed a piece of orange in every bite just to cut the richness. We could only take a few bites and move on to the next dish and we noticed the table next to us had to do the same thing. Our last dish of the evening was the short rib, and no, it wasn't braised short ribs, this was grilled short ribs with a nice char and good flavor. While it was presented nicely and all the elements on the board made for a colorful and fun aesthetic, I can't say all the flavors were cohesive and mind-blowing. \n\nAll-in-all, we had a really great experience here and the ambiance and service is what made this 4 stars for me, but if I was basing the rating on the food we ordered alone it would be more like a 3 star rating.","4684":"Super! Lots of people. Don't wait  (the wait time can be around 1 hour), go straight to the bar and enjoy your dinner there with a cocktail or good Reposado!  \nWe loved the Brussel sprouts, the Japanese Hamachi Crudo and Caramelized Scallops. Met a couple  celebrating their 35 anniversary! Good pleasee to socialize!","4685":"Great combinations await you!\nStart with brussels sprouts small plates, pair with carmelized sunchokes and at least 3 or 4 raw oysters per person. The oysters must be savored as they are layered with many flavors--something green and some caviar and some fantastic oyster liquor. \nThe pappardelle with gouda and roasted chestnuts was perfect for a pre-Christmas family dinner. Along with that, the non-vegetarians enjoyed short ribs--they melt in your mouth, so savor each bite as the complexity coats your tongue.\nYou should finish with dessert, but we skipped it this time in favor of a flight of degestifs. Lots of combinations to try. \nUnbelievably competent waitstaff--such a treat.","4686":"So, a mixed experience!  We were there for a milestone birthday celebration, which we shared when we made the reservation. The chicken was delicious, as were the Brussel sprouts with dates,  but the \"platters\" were not as large as were described.  The paparadelle platter, though tasty, served 1 1\/2 people, not enough for our party of 7. Initially, with a reservation, the host tried to seat us outside (in January), but after we asked for an inside table, they begrudgingly found us a table inside.  The staff, except for the bus person, was not at all gracious. \n\nWe brought champagne and wine, but the restaurant did not have champagne glasses, and the server didn't know how to pour it, despite a $25 corkage fee per bottle.  Overall, though most of the food was tasty, the experience was not stellar.","4687":"Had dinner here for the first time over the weekend. Definitely a place to come for the hip and lively atmosphere\/location. Located in the Funk Zone so it's a convenient place to eat after exploring the area. The outdoor patio is dog friendly as well!  While we enjoyed the location and atmosphere, I wouldn't say the food was outstanding. We loved the Brussels sprouts but our fish and chicken entrees were just ok. Nothing negative but nothing noteworthy either.","4688":"My new favorite Santa Barbara restaurant! The food and service were impeccable. Wow! Everything we ate was delightful and offered a new take on old dishes!!! The cocktails were also very innovative. I shall return on my next SB trip.","4689":"The setting is great in the funk zone and a nice stroll from downtown Santa Barbara. The service is excellent and the food top notch. We had octopus from Spain and Branzino from Greece. Both dishes were well balanced and both had couple of surprising elements that made the food super interesting. The dessert was also heavenly ... a mix of fresh fruit, very delicate creme and meringue. We will go back!","4690":"The food is tasty but exotic. The service there was terrible! We kept having to get another waitress to find our own waiter. Also our waiter was strict about carding our table but didn't card the other next to us (odd.) It wasn't the best experience but the food was good","4691":"Excellent dinner....definitely add to your list of places to visit! We showed up with no reservation but they got us in within an hour. (Would recommend reservations) Service was good but could have been better as far as hostess and wait staff is concerned. Management seem to be top notch. Amazing chefs in the kitchen and it showed in food presentation and delishishness! Thank you for a great evening!","4692":"So, you cannot review this place without mentioning the brussel sprouts with dates. We thought about another order of those all day. The sweetness of the dates and unami of the soy sauce\/white wine vinegar was to die for. Those are worth five stars and everyone knows how good they are. They continued to impress with a perfectly cooked bronzino and the special BBQ brisket satisfied my meat craving. With the BBQ, the cornbread with some sort of light (pimento cheese?) was a knockout. Great wine selection.","4693":"It seems like The Lark is the place to be on a Monday night! That's when I visited and it was crowded which was the first indication of a great restaurant selection. We were asked to stay by the bar while our table was ready which was for about 10 mins. During this time, I tried the cucumber specialty cocktail which had almost no alcohol. My partner in crime tried the humming bird and concurs with the alcohol ratio.\n\nOnce at our table, the waiter explained the dishes were meant to be shared family style so we ordered a few:\n- Deviled eggs with crispy pancetta, jalape\u00f1o, smoked paprika, and chive.\n- Roasted beets and burrata with strawberries, toasted pistachios, hibiscus vinaigrette, fris\u00e9e and watercress.\n- Pineapple & habanero Spanish glazed octopus with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, pickled carrots, mezcal and yogurt. \n- Smoked pork belly with roasted blackberry, almond brittle and house made chicharron. \n\nI liked everything equally. The portions were substantial, the plating was stunning, and the flavor was excellent. My only complaint would be the gaps are often long between dishes.\n\nOverall, The Lark delivers consistent food quality in a retro\/industrial setting. It was a pleasure dining here.","4694":"Stopped here for dinner after heading back from a road trip to Big Sur- super crowded which I thought odd for a Sunday evening, but after eating now I know why that is the case. The food, the ambiance, the scene is great!!! The plates were literally artwork themselves, I almost felt bad for putting my fork into them- Exquisite! 10 stars if I could.. also love that you can see inside the kitchen and it looks like the chefs all have great energy- I imagine it would be hard not to at this place! Worth the wait..","4695":"Fantastic food and great atmosphere.  Service was top notch and good to see families, so good for all.","4696":"Wow....The Lark was easily one of the worst meals I have ever had.  Where to even begin with this place...Dinner started with an overly pungent popcorn starter (why this is served at all is beyond me!), overly spiced and terrible.  Then moved onto the Pimento Sliders which were basically two tiny pieces of bread with cheese and jalape\u00f1os.  Our server was convinced this was not a \"Spicy\" dish until we showed her the chunks of jalape\u00f1os in it, she was nice enough to take this off our bill and we moved on.  The disaster, however, continued. Next dish was the Risotto, which had a few scoops of watery rice and a ton of chunky undercooked veggies. Very heavy and no flavor whatsoever.  The final course was the Short Rib, which was Australian wagyu.  It was brought out bloody rare without even a mention of it (never asked how we wanted it prepared).  We asked our server if they could at least make it medium rare, which she obliged.  It was brought back basically cooked like a piece of charcoal.  Black. And the leek and celery that served as a bed underneath was truly tasteless and awful.  To top all of this off our table was built into what must have been an old church confessional booth.  This would have been an interesting touch  except the door next to us served as a storage bin full of trash and used boxes.  We opted out of desert, we figured we took enough abuse at this point.  We needed Mcconnels ice cream after to get the taste out.  The Lark wins my personal award for worst dining experience of all time, bravo!","4697":"Hipster over rated, over crowded, food isn't impressive for what it's priced. Not impressed at all. There are much better dining experiences around Santa Barbara, hard pass on this one.","4698":"Since we went all the way to Santa Barbara, we decided to try this restaurant, plus it was mentioned on the TV show called Munchies. It's a Valentine's Day night, I thought we have to wait at least for an hour, even we just want to sit on the bar. Luckily, we found our seats in about 20 minutes. The waiter was very attentive, he recommended the house special for the night, the way he described it already made us wanna try. So we had the house special dish which was the crab meat with French potatoes, but the way they cooked it was very heavy. We felt extremely full even we just shared this dishes between two of us. And the only stater that we had was the fried Brussels sprouts. These two dishes already killed us. Heavy and super full. Cannot fit in other.","4699":"The atmosphere on the patio is enchanting. Tip from an old-school \"seafood snob\" Try the sous-vide octopus. Best ever in my life! They also accommodated our 95 year old aunt in mixing up a \"Perfect Rob Roy\" at their bar to her great pleasure.","4700":"Came during the weekend and this place was happening!  Was really glad that I scored a reservation on the day of visit, because I saw a lot of people standing out in the cold waiting for a table because they did not make reservations.\n\nReally like the ambiance of the restaurant, both inside and outdoor seating were lovely.  There was a party going on on the day of our visit, and we were seated outside under the heat lamps.  I actually felt sorry for those sitting on the outer side because the wind was wiping the guest's hair all over the place.  Besides the heat lamps to keep you warm, they also offer blankets if it is cold outside.\n\nAMBIANCE: 4 stars\nFOOD:  4 stars\nSERVICE: 4 stars\nCOCKTAILS: 3 stars\n\nI was really surprised with the generous servings and should have stopped after my first two entrees.  I thought the Pastrami Beef Tongue on Rye was a small appetizer, but it turned out to be a full sandwich.  The Braised Creekstone Beef Cheeks were juicy and tender, and the Grilled Kurobuta Pork Belly were nice and fatty, but I wasn't too big of a fan of their Chicharrones.  \n\nOverall, a great dining experience here and really nice spot for date night.  This is not one of those romantic restaurants, but something that has more energy to it.","4701":"The drinks are pretty good. Try Mule, it has basil leaves. This place was recommended by my sister who lives in Santa Barbara. Make sure you reserve in advance, they're usually booked. The portions are very small and it comes out slow so make sure you order a good amount. The food is decent. Service is excellent. This is not a fine dining so you can dress casual.","4702":"I wish I was a poet to write a review about this place but I'm just a guy celebrating an anniversary with the love of my life and OH MAN!! 100% 10\/10 5 stars 2 thumbs up and every compliment I can give. The drinks were great the steak platter we shared was God's gift to us on our special day. The Brussels sprouts were phenomenal and the chocolate cake had cayenne on the ice cream... which didn't ruin what a wonderful restaurant this is. The staff was great and the kitchen is open so you could see the artists at work. We're visiting Santa Barbara in the future  just for the lark thank you","4703":"Parking - Free valet\n\nAmbiance - Bustling interior with a more serene courtyard\n\nService - We had the best server - Cody. He anticipated our needs, was knowledgeable and had a good personality. He was one of the top servers I have ever encountered. \n\nThe Goods - The Garden of Little Gems Wedge was absolutely delicious. Get this. The Carmelized Diver Scallops were cooked perfectly and I fell in love with the accompanying roasted oyster mushrooms with toasted farro, wild arugula, eureka lemon, grilled spring onion, her produce field flowers. The Central Coast Strawberries & Sonoma Goat Cheese salad was good but not that special. \n\nDesert - the warm blueberry cobbler was yummy. \n\nMocktails - The Bollywood with coconut, celery and cardamom was inventive fresh and quite good. The other two were tart and sweet. Also good.","4704":"So things started off tough, but they totally won us over. At first the drinks took forever (granted it is a busy Friday night). When I they realized the problem they did everything they could to make right. I would highly recommend this place as the food was amazing and the service more than made up for a reasonable mistake. The beef cheeks were awesome and special cudos to the management and the kitchen!","4705":"We loved the Lark! We came for our anniversary and couldn't of picked a better place to celebrate. Food was excellent and came out quickly. Our server was friendly and when we got to our table we were left with a sweet sentiment (the postcard). Very thoughtful, will be back for another night soon.","4706":"Amazing service and great food! Definitely a more upscale type of restaurant for a more romantic evening with a loved one. Also, you HAVE to try the Brussels Sprouts. Best I've ever had!","4707":"The best advice I can give anyone wanting to come to The Lark?  Make reservations!  I'm a planner & I get rezzies everywhere we go & this is the exact reason.  As we were approaching the hostess stand, they were turning away group after group, saying they were fully booked for the evening.....& now we know why\n\nServing both small & large plates, our waiter advised he would be happy to let us know if we were ordering not enough or too much & we ended up w\/ the perfect amount.....he also steered us towards the veggie options which was awesome b\/c you never know what's been fried in what these days!\n\nAlso to note, dishes are meant to be shared & come out as they're prepared, so you're constantly treated w\/ flavor & delights\n\nWe shared:\nPimento Cheese Fritters - Gouda, provolone, pickled serrano chilies, grilled bread - OMG we wished we had ordered like 3 more of these.....SO good & just the right amount of spice\n\nSmoked Persimmon & Burrata - Never would have thought to pair persimmon with burrata but this was likewise incredible\n\nAcorn & Kuri Squash - served with chestnut mousse, vanilla poached cranberries, pumpkin seeds - the squashes did all the talking & we loved the creamy & wintry flavors\n\nChickpea Tagine - served w\/ radicchio, rainbow carrots, goat butter, apricots & almonds - again loved the mix of flavors and had a lovely complexity of flavors\n\nWashed it all down with a lovely local red ( can't remember which ) but this was another recommendation from our server & he certainly knew his stuff\n\nNot ones to pass up dessert, we asked our server for his recommendation & were steered towards their banana bread pudding - WOW.  This was the special of the season & the bread pudding was spongy, the caramel sauce & ice cream made it that much gooier \n\nIf in the area again, first thing I'd do is make a reservation!  This is an experience to repeat!!","4708":"Our party of 6 was very excited to dine at The Lark. We called for a week to try to get reservations...but they were booked. We were instructed to arrive 15 minutes prior to their opening at 5:00 for a chance to sit at the communal table. We anxiously arrived at 4:40 and waited. At 5:00 the doors opened and we happily found 6 seats and began ordering. The fun ended their. Endless mistakes with our drinks and food order brought our evening to a screeching halt. There is great potential with this restaurant, but notice I wrote POTENTIAL. I cannot recommend this restaurant at this time.","4709":"My first meal at the Lark was almost 4 years ago.  But it's been over 6 to 8 months since we had been there last. So our tastebuds had full memory of the amazing flavors, ingredients, perfect portions and service we had grown to love. All of these fond delectable memories and expectations were dashed last Friday night. We ordered an old favorite their little gems wedge salad. I can't begin to relate how disappointing it was. First the ingredients were not properly balanced. The scant pinches of blue cheese, occasional bit of bacon could not hold up to the body of the salad.  It was like having a green leaf salad! \n\nWe ordered the chicken liver mouse and again it was quite disappointing. Not enough chicken liver and it's consistency was less like a mouse and more like melted ice cream. The people next to us asked us if it was desert. \n\nOur main and final dish were lambs ribs. We both love lamb and in the past I have enjoyed lambs ribs so I thought they would understand the inherent qualities of flavor of the meat.  When the ribs arrived they were heaped on the plate like baby back ribs. Completely covered and saturated in a sweet vinegary brown sauce similar to something Toni Roma's would slather on their ribs. The baby was lost in the bath water. \n\nIn regards to the service, let's just say it was disappointing as well. Gone are the consistently enthusiastically presentations with marvelous descriptions of each dish. \n\nLooking around the restaurant as we left at about 8 pm we noticed many empty tables in the front. Perhaps the regulars have gone onto yummier pastures.","4710":"the food wasn't awesome but it wasn't bad, I just didn't dig the vibe there, way to \"factory\" like, the timing of the food was poor. I am not a Cali person and I suppose this is a typical Cali scene.","4711":"Came here for a dinner with a girlfriend while in SB for a long weekend, after hearing everyone we asked say that we needed to go. We were impressed with the creativity and everything was delish. We were also celebrating a birthday and got two free desserts with candles! Definitely order the steak tartare!","4712":"Best place ever! Had 7 plates on menu and they were all amazing. Sat at the communal table, mingled with a few couples there and it's was very pleasant. Staff is very nice. Hands down food was extremely good.","4713":"Great location and setting. Food was just too over spiced, over garnished and had too many flavors. They will continue to improve and edit down. Cocktails were top notch.","4714":"Shit was awesome. I'm born and raise in the South and this was some of the best \"upscale\" southern food I've ever had. Cornbread was amazing. Great atmosphere, great service, great times. Go Dawgs.","4715":"We were in Santa Barbara for our 1 year anniversary and made a reservation at The Lark based on a friend's recommendation.\n\nWhen we arrived, they greeted us with a handwritten postcard and a couple glasses of sparkling rose. We perused the menu and decided to order apps & small plates to create our own meal and everything was delicious. Of the dishes we had, the spicy crab risotto was our favorite. The crab was plentiful & the vegetables were delightful.\n\nWould highly recommend for both the food & level of service!","4716":"Ate here for our 15th wedding anniversary. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful. She guided our dumb asses through the menu. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. Go here and live deliciously.","4717":"Hands down the best dinner I've had in SB so far! The service was great and the atmosphere was so perfect- I'd recommend sitting on the patio if it's available. The food was the highlight of the experience. Everything we ordered was plated beautifully, tasted wonderful, and featured inventive techniques and ingredients. I'll be coming back here ASAP!!","4718":"Service:\nTop notch, we went there when it wasn't crowded. Server and host were very nice and attentive.\n\nAmbiance: suitable for dates and celebrations. To me it was very vintage style decorated. It's very relaxed and chill atmosphere. \n\nFood: food was very unique. We had the Brussels sprouts that were roasted and tasted very sweet. The scallop with the couscous, very delicious! We also had lamb ribs with corn bread. I thought the lamb ribs were very fatty. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts. \n\nI'd highly recommend if you want to try something unique!","4719":"Had to wait 20 minutes at the bar dispite having made a reservation. Visited in the winter and had to sit outside; they have outdoor heaters and blankets but this really dampens the atmosphere.\n\nFood was good generally. Our favorite dish is the brussel sprouts with garum (fish) sauce. The steak tartar was over-spiced and a bit disappointing.\n\nOverall an above average experience but at such prices I expect better.","4720":"Staff: 4\nFood: 4\/0\nGeneral Manager: 0\n\nI finally convinced my vegetarian husband to come with me to the Lark. Given his dietary preferences and aversion to the yuppification of Santa Barbara's Funk Zone, it was tough to get him there. As a non-vegetarian foodie, I had to give it a chance. \n\nThe decor and set up at the Lark is beautiful. The staff is pretty well trained and attentive. Every non-vegetarian item we ordered was delicious and made-well. I appreciate and applaud the effort. \n\nWhere the Lark failed was with their vegetarian options and General Manager- a complete jerk. Given the abundance of SB's fresh ingredients and supply of vegetarian restaurant-goers, one would assume an innovative and emerging restaurant could present creative vegetarian options. Alas, the only vegetarian option presented to my hungry husband was grilled veggies on barley risotto. When asked if the veggies were grilled on the same apparatus as meats, we were advised they were grilled together...therefore, NOT vegetarian. Given the Lark's relationship with Lucky Penny, we asked if a vegetarian pizza could be ordered. We were advised no...understandably so. The waiter kindly suggested we order the child's pizza...for my grown husband, since that was on The Larks menu. So we went with the suggestion and proceeded to enjoy our night.\n\nNot long after we ordered, I noticed someone of \"authority\" berating our waiter... \"Who Ordered this Pizza?\" ...I could read his lips and angry gestures. Our waiter was chastised for a solid 2 minutes by Dan Russo, The Lark's GM. Coming from a family of restaurateurs and a server myself once I took offense to that type of behavior. The GM should not have yelled at his staff right in front of patrons. To add salt to the wounds, the GM himself delivered the pizza to my husband- making a giant gesture of putting the plate in front of him....well before anybody else at the table received their entrees. \n\nThe situation could have been handled so differently, the GM should have waited until after the shift to speak with his staff and the pizza should have come out with the other entrees. \n\nDan Russo- Santa Barbara is not Chicago, nor is it San Francisco. Our town is small where word-of-mouth is paramount. As an experienced GM, you should know better than to treat your patrons and staff with such arrogance. I have seen many restaurants rise and fall in Santa Barbara...it happens when locals stop coming in...hopefully The Lark does not fall victim to your douchebaggery.","4721":"Came here last month and the food was good. The menu changes all the time so what we ordered might no longer be available. It's family style so you can order a few things and share.  I'd pass on the complimentary popcorn and its not fresh and over spiced. We ordered the cheese broad which was nothing special and the strawberries had no taste. We ordered the lamb ribs which were delicious, but the cornbread dry and didn't taste very good. The roasted Sanoma chicken with grits was good. I very much enjoyed the cheesy grits, but the chicken was bland and nothing special. The star of the night was this salad, which had melons (honeydew, watermelon and cantaloupe) , cucumbers, goats milk taziki, mint, pickled shallots,  and pistachios and is was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten!! I would go back for this salad alone and the reason why i gave them 4 stars.","4722":"Excellent meal, wonderfully sweet service, adorable ambience, creative unique-tasting dishes. It's got it all baby! We were worried about sitting outside at 9pm in the winter but they've got heating and fire pits galore! The brussel sprouts are so flavorful and live up to the hype. The hamachi crudo had a lot of crazy awesome flavors going on. The carrots and whipped feta was very ambitious but good and quite rich.","4723":"You know a place is hoppin' when you have to return three separate times to see if space opened up. After spying a menu from The Lark at the place I was staying, I had it my head that I needed to try this place before heading out of town. I'm glad I didn't have my heart set on dinner there because I would have been hangry before too long. \n\nIn between my multiple trips to the hostess station, my boyfriend and I wandered around enjoying the tapas and drink menus of other local, less crowded eateries. Around 10:30, we checked back for a final time and were able to grab seats at the communal table by the bar area. Never underestimate the pull of hipster eateries sporting a bevy of Edison bulbs and exposed wood....\n\nSadly, the menu I had set my heart on was barely a shade of its former self. But I ordered the Deviled Eggs and the Brussel Sprouts (per the recommendation of a tasting room employee earlier in the day) and a Grand & Mulberry.\n\nThe Deviled Eggs were pretty delicious, but not something that I would have considered a \"must have\". The sprouts, though good, were also very sweet and I found them hard to finish because of it. My drink was pretty tasty, but it took longer to come to the table than my food did.\n\nAll in all, my expectations were pretty sorely dashed here. I had left better places earlier that night that I should have cut my loses and stuck with at 10p on a Saturday. The final cost of such a small selection also seemed pretty high since I thought that overall quality of the food was hardly the best of the weekend.\n\nThe Lark is probably a more fun place during the week, when all the \"cool\" tourists have returned elsewhere. But on this particular Saturday, The Lark and I did not connect.","4724":"This place was recommended by hotel concierges sink checked it out. I went in around 6:30 and luckily got a spot at the bar. The wait for a table was 2 hours on the day after 7\/4. The food was incredible. I got the scallop which was on the pricey side on the menu but the scallops they serve was the biggest one I have ever seen.  Seasoning was good and it was more like a little bit Asian fusion idea in the dish. I had two cocktails: forgot the name for the first one but second is the JP's Paloma. This one is extremely tasty.","4725":"Food was excellent and the staff was knowledgeable about what food was appropriate for me as I'm celiac and can't eat gluten, definitely would go back.","4726":"Not a traditional steak house. You have to be adventurous with your pallet. The pasta option was so amazing. Service was great! Great wine choices as well.","4727":"Me and my husband visited The Lark for our 1st wedding anniversary! We got warmly greeted by very nice hosts at the front and got sat down immediately, small suggestion make a reservation cause the place was packed! And I understand why! We sat down and got greeted by our friendly server Martin that gave us the most attentive and personable service I think I have ever gotten! \nWe started with some good cocktails and a delicious crispy Brussels Sprouts. The we had the lamb chops and the pasta! If you going there, absolutely have it, it's really really good! \nYou can also finish your meal with the Chocolate Grenache ! \nBottom line, go there, ENJOY AND ASK FOR MARTIN! \n\nThank you The Lark!","4728":"I know it's \"the\" new spot in town and they need some time to adjust..but, we are in Santa Barbara and there is no need to put pressure on the clientele, especially locals,  sitting at the bar when they, anyway gonna stay and drink and eat to have a good time and a great experience. Be careful to be too pushy when your customer still have wine in his glass , just saying... Over wise, I really like the design, the concept, the look, the patio...etc...I need and love to come back with friends several more times to get an objective opinion concerning the food... it's not really relevant to do it at the first glance...","4729":"Ambiance was awesome and service was great. We enjoyed almost every dish we ordered. Brussel sprouts were amazing!!! The nuts were a bit spicy. Loved the pastramied tongue and risotto. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.","4730":"It's a very nice spot with cool crowd. The duck was yummy and Brussel sprouts. Both I believe would be a favorite from most despite their tastes. On the other hand the pork which was talked up tasted like ham served at a more casual spot that would maybe cost 10 dollars not 30. Pretty pork dish, not great. Same for fish, There is a cream that isn't compatible. The chef seems to try to be interesting with twists that don't go together best.","4731":"My husband and I had dinner at The Lark.  We heard such great reviews about this place and decided to give it a try.  We read that is shared plates, no problem.  We heard the brussel sprouts were good, so we ordered them.  The brussel sprouts were okay.  I think I make better brussel sprouts.  We ordered the lamb ribs because I do not usually cook lamb.  The ribs were SO SO salty and fatty it was hard to eat them.  We also ordered the salad wedge which was tasty. The service was very good.  They have an overpriced wine list.   Overall the experience was mediocre.  With all the restaurants in Santa Barbara & Goleta the meal did not thrill us enough to return to The Lark.","4732":"On a day trip to SB I just stopped in here for 10 mins for pork belly sliders. So because I just ordered and ran I can only say the following: the sliders were bomb. The atmosphere here was cool and there were alot of things I saw the servers walking by with that I wanted to try. Alas, I had to get on the road back to LA...","4733":"I dream of their chicken. It's absolutely delicious. Lark gets lots of local repeat business so call ahead. You can count on this kitchen to prepare fresh and well prepared dishes. The atmosphere includes fireplaces.","4734":"I don't know why this bothers me so much and wondering if it bothers others so I'm going to post my review about my experience and you can decide for yourself. 1. They serve bread but don't tell you 2. If you say you are celebrating a bday they say they are going to bring out something but psych they don't!  3. If you don't buy drinks you don't belong!  Here's our experience....\nMade 7pm reservations for 4 for a Tuesday night during thanksgiving week and at the time they asked if it was a special occasion and I said yes it was my husbands bday week. Arrived early and thankfully seated right away. Not the best table but hey we were seated! Waiter introduced himself asked if it was our first time and we said yes. He also stated to my husband who had been given a birthday postcard by the hostess that a surprise would come later! Great that's so sweet We didn't order drinks. We ordered the Brussels, the pasta dish bc needed a vegetarian dish and the half order of the chicken dish. All great! No complaints about food! \nLater came and the check was brought and no surprise came so I was disappointed and went to the hostess stand to inquire about the \"surprise\" she confirmed one should have been brought out & it was by someone who couldn't tell us what it even was. At this level of place ALL staff should know! We still don't know what it was but maybe meringue something. \n\nHere's the other thing that bothered me: Throughout the meal I noticed bread being served to other tables so finally I asked \"did I miss bread on the menu or is it complimentary?\" Waiter said \"it's complimentary but we brought you popcorn\" and I was like great thanks for letting us know WE HAD A CHOICE!  I mean come on if it's my first time dining there and you knew that then why not ask us if we want the bread instead of acting like it's some secret menu thing???!!!  Nothing peeves me more than not knowing my options at a restaurant! The popcorn was this tiny tiny bowl of popcorn and for 4 it really wasn't enough. The waiter should have said something about our options and let us decide. I shouldn't have to see it walk by and ask! \n\nSo you're welcome everyone reading this - now you know ask for bread! It looked delicious but I wouldn't know... bc I didn't know... now you know! \n\nWon't go back not even for the bread! It just felt like bc we didn't order pricey drinks the waiter gave up on us. Sad to feel this way but that's truly how we felt.","4735":"One of my favorite restaurants to eat at when in Santa Barbara!  Their menu is always interesting, the drinks are delicious and the ambiance is fun and lively.","4736":"As a New Yorker in a foreign land, I came in to the Lark not sure what to expect.  The first impression was a friendly atmosphere in a rustic setting.  The host and waiters were friendly and inviting.  Of particular note the service staff remained highly attentive throughout the evening.\n\nWe started with the sunchokes which was my favorite dish.  Unique savory flavor opened up the meal.  A strawberry salad with goat cheese was carried by a light sweeet flavor, about as different from the previous appetizer as possible.  We had the burrata which also features a citrus sweetness.  While I overall enjoyed the burrata I found it to be heavy on salt.\n\nWe had the wagyu meatballs as a main course.  Perfectly textured with a buttery smooth consistency.  Again a little heavy on the salt here.  \n\nValrhona chocolate cake for dessert was good but without any particular standout qualities.  \n\nOverall impression: \n\nA creative menu with generally good execution.  Salt in some dishes was overbearing.  Service was exceptional.  4.5 but rounded up to 5 for service.","4737":"I want to start by saying that I don't like seared fish. I like raw fish or fish cooked through, but that halfway point, if you will, ain't it for me. UNLESS I'm at The Lark. Then, apparently, I love seared fish because they do it like no other. It is delicious. It also holds onto that deliciousness as leftovers. There were a few courses passed around during my night at The Lark, and they were all pretty great. The service was also quick and attentive with our large dining group. I appreciated how they kindly accommodated our many varied requests for heating at our outdoor table.\nAll in all, I'm satisfied with my first experience here.","4738":"This place was recommended by hotel concierges sink checked it out. I went in around 6:30 and luckily got a spot at the bar. The wait for a table was 2 hours on the day after 7\/4. The food was incredible. I got the scallop which was on the pricey side on the menu but the scallops they serve was the biggest one I have ever seen.  Seasoning was good and it was more like a little bit Asian fusion idea in the dish. I had two cocktails: forgot the name for the first one but second is the JP's Paloma. This one is extremely tasty. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting SB.","4739":"Amazing food! I love the Lark! I look forward to going back every time I'm in Santa Barbara.","4740":"For those of us elitist, pseudo-righteous food critics, I'm sure we all have our own rubrics for our Yelp reviews. My five star reviews are reserved for fare so good, I would come back again and again despite the siren calls of unexplored restaurants yet to be tasted. Think Lily's tacos or Test Pilot's cocktails or McConnell's ice cream and cookies- just solid choices that will never steer you wrong no matter the cost or atmosphere. The Lark now joins these ranks and I already can't wait to come back (I just reread this paragraph, and my God I need a new hobby).\n\nService & atmosphere: the space is comfortable and beautiful with wrap around outdoor seating, communal high tops, bar space, booths, and four-tops. The wood accents, twinkle lights, and lively crowd all create a really nice dinner environment for any occasion. All servers and wait staff were very attentive, I don't think I ever saw the bottom of my water glass or the popcorn bowl. \n\nFood: We ordered the brussel sprouts, wedge salad, crab gratin, carbonara, and the special duck. The standouts for me were absolutely the wedge salad and duck. I can't believe I'm saying this as a hesitant omnivore, but this salad was amazing. House smoked blue cheese, warm glazed bacon, watermelon radish, spicy pecans, fine herbs- it all just worked beautifully, If I could replicate this for my daily lunch everyday, I f*cking would. I don't remember the specifics of the duck special, but it came with pumpkin and citrus and was cooked beautifully. Crispy and rich skin, flavor-packed and juicy meat, I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I ate most of this before the rest of the table even got a chance. The sprouts and gratin were solid choices too, especially the gratin with huge chunks of crab. The carbonara was delicious, though VERY different from traditional carbonara (the egg and pork belly was not as forward as the fennel pollen).\n\nOkay well I'm getting a little annoyed with my own wannabe foodie pretentiousness. Just go to  The Lark, I'll probably be there eating everyone's duck.","4741":"I am not really a fan of this place; I can see why others enjoy it though. The food was pretty good but just wayyyy too expensive but, I guess that's why people come here? because it's fancy.\n\nThey tell you everything is family style so I was expecting a bigger amount for each plate but all the plates were small- normal amount for one person. We shared 4 plates and I did not leave away full, but I guess that's typical for an expensive restaurant. \n\nI like the free spicy popcorn that they serve you while you wait for your food. It was very seasoned and it was a nice change from typical bread. We had their famous Brussels sprouts and they were charred on the outside- not a fan. Their lamb and chicken were cooked well but I have had better.\n\nOverall, I would not come back to this place.","4742":"I went to the Lark on May 31st and got charged twice on my credit card. I've called 3 times to try to get them to reversed the double charge they did but nothing have happened. Yesterday, third time calling, I talk to a manager, she said she were going to take care of this and I asked her to call me back to confirm the refund. She never call back and I have no refund. So sad that a restaurant like this behave this way when they do mistakes.","4743":"Time has not been kind or maybe it was just our experience b\/c others around us seemed to be having a good time\n\nMr & I brought Mom here for her 80th birthday & I thought this would be the perfect treat but we started off getting seated on the patio, in the corner, where I had to literally climb over the stroller of the table beside us.....it was freezing out there & Mom had no jacket.  I asked to be moved to a table inside but the answer was no.  Umm, okay.....\n\nThe waitress kept calling Mom \"honey\" which was very condescending and then she kept trying to talk us out of our order saying it was too much food.  Well, if it's too much, we'll get it to go & you still get more money.  Seems like a win-win to me. Stop telling us how to order - especially when you advised the table beside to order even more dishes than we ordered.....that made zero sense!\n\nWe shared the Brussels sprouts & they were heavenly but then the small hiccups above turned to downright falling on their faces.  Mr & I both ordered the mushroom pasta. We wanted our own b\/c I was sick & wanted to keep my germs to myself if there were any leftovers.  They brought out the pasta & then we sat for 20 min while we waited on Mom's chicken.  It was only after someone walked by & asked how was everything & we said we didn't know b\/c we were waiting on our Mom's dish that she went & tracked it down....10 min later.  Cold pasta.....yup, no offer to heat it back up\n\nI get it that this is a family \/ shared experience but when the 3 of us are ordering our own dishes then maybe one could infer that we each wanted our own plate.  A quick question could have solved that \n\nThere was no offer of any dessert options. Our waitress said a birthday cake was being brought out for Mom. But the Mr & I wanted dessert too....but not after waiting another 20 min b\/c we seemed to have been forgotten, out there in the cold, dark corner. The table beside us who also had a birthday got the full range of dessert options made available to them.  Umm, okay....\n\nThen the bill comes out & the Mr & I asked for the 2nd boxed up portion of pasta that the Mr couldn't finish & the waitress tells us she combined everything into the same box!  First of all, since when does one EVER assume all leftovers should be in the same box!?  So I tell her I'm sick & we'd been expecting separate boxes & she apologized & said she could have the kitchen make another portion and then split it up for us....sorry but no.  We'd already been there 2 hours for 1 shared appetizer and 1 main course.  I wasn't about to wait another hour for another serving of pasta.\n\nShe did remove the pasta from our bill for the inconvenience but overall, this was an awful birthday experience for our entire family. Too many other great restaurants around to have to deal with this again!  We won't be back","4744":"Amazing place in Santa Barbara! Best service and area and the food is incredible. Get a reservation ahead of time it gets very busy. It's fun to come here with a big group of friends and order tons of different things because everything on the menu is so different with such unique flavors \n\nMUST GETS :\n- Brussel Sprouts : these are the best I've ever had. Literally to die for \n- asparagus : Seasonal for the spring, and just so fresh I was surprised how much I enjoyed this \n- Branzino : On the bigger side for this restaurant. Fish was cooked perfectly with amazing flavor \n- hanger steak : also a great size and the steak is cooked to a perfect medium rare \n\nYou can't go wrong with anything on this menu and it's fun each season they switch it up!!","4745":"Wow...this place is has fantastic food! It's a fairly small place so I had to sit at a communal table but it turned out to be very fun and close to the semi-open kitchen. The only con was that I found them to be a little too salty for my taste overall though. I enjoyed the pasta, beet salad, brussel sprouts and most of all the cheese board. The latter had to have been the best thing ordered...the cheeses they choose to serve were some of the best tasting ones I have ever had. Also had the hangar steak but found there to be too much burnt broccoli. Overall, I totally recommend this place in funk town Santa Barbara.","4746":"This place was incredible. The tomato cucumber salad was so good we got two... i was amazed by the vegan meal the chef whipped up for me that wasn't on the menu. It was so tasty. My friend loved the pork. Not an extensive kids menu but my son Loved his fries and Brussels. Our server was outstanding. He's worked there about 4.5 years. Very short hair. I wish i knew his name so i could put it here.","4747":"This is just about my favorite restaurant in SoCal and always try to go when we are up in Santa Barbara\nHave been several times and each visit is delicious and imaginative \nThis trip we enjoyed the tagine -which is a very light Moroccan stew \nThen the tuna crudo -so good \nFollowed by our favorite -the pork belly -crispy with strawberry and rhubarb \nFinally the beef cheeks -very tender and rich \nService on point as well \nFinally was very busy on Monday -which is great to see for our struggling restaurants as they come back","4748":"What a gem. Very cool atmosphere, sexy lighting and ambiance. The roasted beets w pickled onions was the best ever. We left the yogurt sauce on the side, and were glad. The sea bass was so elegant and beautifully presented. The lamb kebab was enjoyable but portion a bit small for two men. The prawns were outstanding, but only three. The buttermilk fried chicken as a big hit. I would come again anytime for this quality food flavor explosion experience!","4749":"A complimentary addictively dusted amuse bouche arrived at the communal table where walk-ins are perched to view the hustle and bustle. I ordered a New Zealand sparkling water that came in a scrubbed blue metal carafe to tide things over. My Pisco Sour ($12) crowned with froth and a My-yard-lavished cauliflower dish ($17) was tossed in a spiced harissa then plated as a mint-leaf and kumquat studded marvel. The only meal of the day, I gently completed the meal with a small invigorating scoop of tahini ice cream ($10) glistening with a saffron honey that evoked a farther destination of unfamiliar pleasures.","4750":"We came in from out of town and the hostess was rude. When in the hospitality business, be nice. Was looking forward to the food and ambiance.  We were turned away. Went to Oku, they were amazing and friendly.","4751":"Amazing meal!!\nPop corn 5 stars (I never thought that could be possible)\nBrussel sprouts Amazing!!! 5 stars,  I would go there again just for Brussel sprouts. \nFried chicken 5 stars pretty dam good. \nI will totally eat here again. \nThis is a very hip and trendy restaurant but the food is very good. Bill was very fair for all the food we eat. \nDefinitely will return.","4752":"Pretentious. Poncy. Pricy. We were informed upon being seated that dishes were \"family style\" for sharing. Ok no problem. Actually big problem. A bunch of pretentious dishes may work when everybody can pick and choose for themselves but it's a problem when you have to share. Especially when half your party are relative strangers and you have no idea what tastes you share. After 15 minutes of haggling I resorted to the beer menu and was horrified to see the hallmark of the modern hipster restaurant- a bunch of beers I've never heard of. Is it so hard to have a basic selection that doesn't involve triple IPAs? I don't drink Budweiser but a European lager or even a couple of domestics? We somehow got through our evening but if you're looking for somewhere to go for a fun meal with friends I'd definitely avoid this place.","4753":"We heard amazing things about the Lark.  After waiting a month to get a reservation we were looking forward to a nice experience. It didn't happen.\n\nThe waiter was pushy and loud and seemed uninterested in serving us.  The food was average tasting and very expensive.  The portions were small and not filling.  As locals we expected more- we won't be back.  This place is an expensive tourist trap - beware.","4754":"The flavor and service is absolutely exceptional in terms of quality. Quantity... is the food and a couple of cocktails worth over $100 when you leave hungry? Nooooooot really. It's an impressive place to take a date when you expect to get lucky at the end of the night because it's not tooooooo filling, but on a regular date with your significant other? Skiiiiiip.\n\n\n\njohannes c Steenkamp","4755":"The good: If it's just the two of you all you need to order is the fried chicken and a few drinks. HUGE fried chicken portion. \n\nThe bad: my $28 prawn toast came with 3 prawns on the toast with the heads and tails on but the body shell removed. This would be totally fine at a tapas place where the prawns would be over a nice bed of rice or with some slices of toast. To be fair the waiter did tell me they would be head on. But this is a toast covered in sauce and micro greens. \n\nI had to deconstruct the entire toast in order to deshell the shrimp and then remake each bite. \n\nI understand the allure and the taste factor with cooking and serving shellfish unshelled but this is shrimp toast. \n\nIf you order a lobster roll should you expect to crack some claws???\n\nAlso after I got the heads and tails off the \"prawns\" ended up being a little bigger than cocktail shrimp...not big tiger prawns or jumbo shrimp from whole foods. \n\n$28 for shrimp toast the chefs didn't finish peeling. \n\nWELCOME TO SANTA BARBARA HAHA","4756":"The food and service were unbelievable. Had the fried quail, prawns, Brussel sprouts, cucumber salad, and the wedge with goat cheese instead of blue cheese. Every flavor just melted together into perfection. Such a dynamic menu! Our waiter Dorian was amazing too!","4757":"When we decided to have our small wedding in Santa Barbara, I searched for private event dining rooms for our reception and when I came across The Pullman Room (private dining room within The Lark), it was love at first sight. The aesthetic, vibe and of course, the food, was right up our alley. After sending my first inquiry to reserve the Pullman Room to the execution of our forever memorable reception\/dinner, working with Silvia and Vienna was a dream! They worked so well with our vendors and answered any all questions in a timely manner. I also want to give a shout out to the staff that worked the night of our reception - they were exceptional!","4758":"Favorite spot for dinner in SB. Changing menu with in season dishes and a very unique ordering style. Its basically family style, but with food that will change your life. The wait staff is always very helpful in suggesting how much and what to order. The pork shank is incredible. Great wine list and beer selection as well. I come here every time I am in SB.","4759":"The Lark was a solid restaurant. Service, food, and ambiance was all great! Also it's definitely kid friendly which is amazing. \n\nOur server was very sweet and attentive- constantly checking in if we needed anything. \n\nThe food was very tasty! It's an American with a Mediterranean twist cuisine. \nThe Lark brings out some interesting spiced popcorn to start- it was good but not my favorite? We ordered the Brussels sprouts, hanger steak, and the garden of salanona lettuce salad. The sprouts were tasty but my least favorite of everything I tried. I probably would skip on these. The salad was delicious I loved the buttermilk vinaigrette. Lastly, we shared the hangar steak that was surrounded by a delicious sauce along with sungold tomatoes and crispy Thai basil. \n\nI didn't save room for dessert but definitely will have to come back to try!","4760":"The Lark is a great location and filled with  ambiance. The staff is professional and  friendly. However, we ordered only appetizers and chose the Brussel sprouts and cheese  board with two glasses of wine. The Brussel sprouts and wine were lovely however, the cheese board was lacking. There were three cheese selections with three pieces of bread. I was surprised there was not at least an array of olives or possibly tomatoes or nuts. It seemed very lacking compared to most cheese boards we've ordered at  high end restaurants. Maybe consider at least olives, an interesting spread, some interesting nuts to add to the cheesebaird experience with your local wines. Just a suggestion.","4761":"To: Restaurants of America\nC\/O: The Lark, Santa Barbara\n\nDear Restaurants of America,\n\nI recognize that as Canadians, we blend in and seem like everybody else. So when you say \"four dishes is the right amount of food for two people\", we will believe you. Particularly when we are sitting in a lovely room that has rehabilitated a warehouse with just the right level of rustic hip and modern finesse. You know, a signal that this is a good restaurant, and not some kind of casual chain that's aiming to cram us with the maximum volumes of carbs.\n\nBased on that trust, when you bring us delicious popcorn to snack on before our dishes start to arrive, we will foolishly eat it. After all, the waiter seems like a nice boy, and he is very attentive. It is only when our Brussels sprout \"snack\" arrives that we begin to worry. Yes, the Brussels sprouts are delicious -- roasted, crunchy, yum -- but your idea of a \"snack\" is what my  mom would prepare as a side dish for six people at Thanksgiving. (OK, four people -- she has that Jewish anxiety about having less than twice as much food as anyone could possibly eat. And yes, we have Thanksgiving in Canada, too -- it's just earlier, on the same day as Columbus Day.)\n\nThe Brussels sprouts are followed very quickly by a board of burrata and stone fruit that are the highlight of the meal -- not just because they're fresh and juicy and a wonderful combination of tart and creamy, because they still found us when we were actually hungry.  \n\nBy the time we finished the burrata, we were completely full -- though not too full to face the hamachi crudo, we were full enough that it dented our appreciation. And by the time our gnocchi arrived -- gnocchi!! with crab meat!! do you know how close that comes to my dream dish??? -- we literally couldn't take more than one amazing bite. Each dish followed so quickly on the other that we didn't have time to digest and make room for more.\n\nSo American restauranteurs, please take pity on us. Don't let your Canadian neighbours waste their precious stomach space on Brussels sprouts (even delicious Brussels sprouts) when we need to save room for our gnocchi. And if you're going to encourage us to order a metric crap ton (.09 of an Imperial crap ton) of food, please pace it slowly so that we can enjoy it.\n\nBecause everything at the Lark is worthy of appreciation. It's fantastic. Which is why I'm still mourning the uneaten gnocchi.","4762":"It was more than two years ago that I reviewed the Lark. We were the first customers that first day. While I loved the restaurant I have to admit I was skeptical that it would survive.  They have a large staff which seems to be the secret of their success.  Since my first visit I have been here about 70 more times so I guess you could call me a fan.  I enjoy the bar or the community table.  \n\nWhat impresses me the most is that a restaurant that serves only dinner has a full staff of chefs who arrive early in the morning to prep the food.  During the dinner service there are at least a dozen chefs in the kitchen.  The attention to detail is beyond belief and every dish is worth trying.  \n\nSince my first visit the menu has changed and the specialty cocktails have changed as well. I miss some of the previous items yet their replacements are equally amazing.  I have always enjoyed the Wedge salad.  Lots of wonderful bleu cheese with candied bacon and pecans.  If you sit at the bar their burger is one of the best you will ever eat and for $13 or $14 it is a bargain.  It is \"off the menu\" so you feel like a regular when you order it.  Another entree to consider is the half chicken.  A dish that two people will share with leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.  Like all the dishes the preparation is wonderful as it is brined for 24 hours+ before cooking.  You have my guarantee that it will be moist and fall-apart good.  \n\nIf you want a unique experience you can ask to have your reservation of two in the confessional booth, a very cool relic from the 1700's imported because the owner thought it would be a nice addition.","4763":"Incredible all around, we had the steak, chicken, and Brussels sprouts. All were outstanding and I'd highly recommend. Cocktails were great and dessert tres leches was phenomenal as well. I would definitely stop here if you can in SB","4764":"Wow wow wow! Every dish was phenomenal, the service was impeccable (we love you, Oscar), and the ambiance was unbeatable! We had just gotten engaged a couple hours prior, so they even sent over two glasses of bubbly to celebrate! A little pricey, but worth it for the experience and celebration of our love!","4765":"This place is fantastic all around. I had some sort of sour green oysters (?), cheese bread & full dinner & drinks. We will drive back there just for this spicy cheese bread. Ridiculously good!","4766":"The best meal I had over an entire weekend in SB. \n\nCame here with the kids but was cool to hear their kids menu (which is oral only...lol) which included pasta, burger and pizza from Lucky Penny next door. They also bring you a tasty popcorn to start as something to nibble. My wife and I had a cocktail which were good. \n\nWe split the smoked panzanella salad which I highly recommend. I heard that they serve a \"secret\" burger in the bar (gruyere, secret sauce, candied bacon) so I ordered that. One of the best burgers I've had. The matchstick fries were fantastic too. My wife got one of the raw fish dishes. Don't remember which one but she loved it too. \n\nKids enjoyed their food and the service was great. A must visit when in SB.","4767":"Really strong flavors here. The breadth of veg offerings is among the best I've seen anywhere. Crispy Brussels are everywhere these days but lark executed them exceptionally well. The beets and chickpea tagine were also terrific, but the cauliflower was surprisingly undercooked. The accompaniments made the dish quite tasty but it was closer to raw than caramelized. My brother loved the branzino and of the two desserts we sampled, we enjoyed the panna cotta a lot but found the olive oil cake sadly dry. The sneaky highlight of the meal may have been the Indian spiced popcorn that was served in lieu of bread, crazy addictive. Our server was lovely and found a great ros\u00e9 for us so we will definitely be back when in town!","4768":"The service was great. The steak was amazing. I recommend you get a reservation. They have valet parking which is free. A beautiful outside area with bonfire.","4769":"We came here for our last dinner of our Santa Barbara honeymoon. The restaurant is beautiful. We made reservations ahead of time. \n(Parking: there is a public lot that's close by for free for the first 75 mins)\nWe were tucked back in this very quiet part where I sat in a confessional? It was an experience in itself. \nWe got the complimentary popcorn. We both enjoyed it. \nWe started off with the mushroom crostini type of thing. We loved! \nNext was the lamb shawarma -- I am thankful the server warned us what it was because we would have been surprised. They mash up the lamb abs cool it down. They abs honeyed apricots and pickled veggies. You put the lamb on a pita cracker kind of thing. It was very good. \nLastly we got the hanger steak. DELICIOUS. \n\nWarning: they time your food out so you get one thing at a time. They consult with you the order it should come out in. It cannot come out all at once.\n\nWould totally return!","4770":"The ambiance is great, probably the only restaurant in town that is a bit hipper than the rest.\n\nThe food seems to be overly dressed. Service is good but not great, probably because they are always busy. Both times I sat at the communal table and I had to ask many times for water. \n\nI've never had bone marrow with so much crap on it, it's usually delicious just the way it is, however the amount of other stuff on the marrow made it not that great. The steak was okay, the veggies that came with it was better.","4771":"Love the food, love the service, love experience. The staff was really friendly. Our server Laurel was so sweet and helpful.","4772":"Ambiance is great, drinks are amazing, food tasted good! Do wish menu had more items on it. Service was very very slow pace.","4773":"You know that Flawless song by Beyonc\u00e9 where she goes \"God damn, God damn\", that was my exact reaction to every dish I had at The Lark. From the complimentary popcorn (cinnamon + Sage --are you kidding me? Best flavor combo) to the Grilled Spanish Octopus dish, everything we ordered that night was amazing right after the other. So many unique flavors yet they somehow all work. This place specializes in family style dining which is great if you have a group of friends celebrating a special occasion & want to try everything on the menu. \n\nService was impeccable. Migs (our server) came through that night with all the best suggestions for our first time having dinner at the Lark. He never steered us wrong bc we loved all the dishes. Everyone who works there was so nice and helpful! The Lark definitely knows how to treat their customers & make sure they have an enjoyable experience. From the tiny details like having a birthday postcard for us to  having fleece blankets if you need them while sitting outside. \n\nLove the ambience, love the interior & exterior of the restaurant, the staff, open kitchen, and of course  the free validation on parking. One of the best dinners I've had in awhile where everything went right. Thank you Lark! \n\nHere are the dishes we ordered that night if you're interested knowing. Heads up, they do have seasonal menus so it might not be there when you go.\n\nWest Coast oysters\nHanger steak tartare--comes with a Budweiser which is so extra but I love it\nBrussel sprouts\nJuniper smoked duck breast--comes with a croissant \nGrilled Spanish octopus--MY FAVORITE DISH from the night! Stellar! One of the best octopus meal I've had in my life--so tender and flavorful!","4774":"5 STARS!  No doubt!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The Lark made for an outstanding birthday dinner!  Despite all the general COVID awkwardness, the ambiance was lovely.  The service was genuine and top-notch.  Food was delicious!  Surprisingly, the cheeseboard and mission fig tartine were KILLER!  (OMG... so good!).   Mini wedge salad and tagliatelle pasta were also GREAT.  We also had the ribs, which were very good, just not traffic-stopping, like the rest.  MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN SANTA BARBARA!!  Can't wait til next time!!  MUST GO!!","4775":"Food and service was excellent, our dinner was amazing and the wine was superb. From beginning to end we felt extremely taken care of. Thank you, we'll be back soon!","4776":"Beautiful setting, attentive service, and an exquisite, bright, and flavorful meal. Worth the wait!!","4777":"So I had been holding off coming just because I had heard so many mixed reviews. Some had said its large portions and should go with a few people but then I also heard the portions were small and you'll be leaving hungry. I finally gave it a go with my fiance and let's just say after spending $140, not including the tip, we left to corazon cocina to have a taco!!\n\nOur server William was great and very attentive! He was very knowledgeable about the menu, knew just how to talk up any dish we asked about and was just overall awesome. \n\nI know oysters are pricey but $4 each sounds a bit steep. We ordered 6 anyway. The drinks were well made. Not too stiff and not too weak, which seems to be the problem nowadays. So as I mentioned people kept saying the dishes are sharing portions, so unless people go with others that barely eat or I'm just a hungry hippo but I would NOT call these dishes sharing portions. I love food and this girl can definitely eat. The prawns going for 28 dollars, sits on a Texas toast covered in uni butter and 3 prawns. It seemed more of an appetizer than an actual entree. Then for the fried chicken, it was great and a bit more filling than the prawns at least but it was missing a side, some mashed potatoes perhaps?? \n\nOur bill totaled to $146 something plus tip almost $200 later and we still had to go get some food. We walked over to corazon cocina and had one of their delicious and filling tacos!! I guess if you go to the lark you better have ate something before or be someone that doesn't eat much in general. A 3 bite and I'm full type of person would love it here...sorry but not for me. Enjoy the pretty pictures.","4778":"We came in with a wedding party of 10 on May 7th, Brooke our server was AMAZING!! We love this place, food was great for sharing, service was attentive and the atmosphere is polished but laid back SB at the same time. Thank you for making our time special!!","4779":"the lark mistreats employees and the disabled! \n\ni saw chef logan last night mistreat an employee who was clearly distressed and disabled! do not support this establishment!","4780":"Great restaurant with outstanding food and service. Our server was Taylor and she was excellent. My wife had the skirt steak with shishitos and fried onions and I had the pork chop with black eyed peas and corn succotash  and both were better than we expected.","4781":"Such a great experience! Laurel put up with us all night long and was a sweetheart. Give that b a raise","4782":"While we've been to many restaurants where the quality of food is higher than average, most are disappointing due to their lack of creativity in the use of ingredients.\n\nThat's where The Lark stood out - their awesomely flavorful dishes. The Crispy Brussels Sprouts - medjool dates, garum, serrano chile, sesame, lime - and their Poppyseed Popcorn table treat are worth the visit alone.\n\nWe shared the Maitake Mushroom Risotto and the Caramelized Cauliflower which were both extremely satisfying. Some delicious wine, Valrhona Chocolate Cake and cappuccinos contributed to a perfect meal.\n\nCody, our waiter, made the evening that much more enjoyable with his attentive and friendly service; and awesome sense of humor. (6\/15\/2019)\n\nHaving lived in Santa Barbara for over 4 years, the unpretentious and lively \"vibe\" is definitely one of the best that Santa Barbara has to offer. This was our second visit to The Lark and it will be a regular stop on our occasional visits back to Santa Barbara from L.A.","4783":"This restaurant has been recommended as one of the best in Santa Barbara and now I know why! We got JP's Paloma and Thyme Lapse which were both light and refreshing cocktails. We tried a couple and all of them were delicious! We also ordered the Smoked Crab dip and Lark cheeseboard. I never had smoked crab so I thought it was interesting and it paired well with the house made potato chips. I've had many cheeseboards but this one was one of the best I've had! The cheese was presented beautifully on a pistachio spread with baby raisins and a side of grilled ciabatta. Not only was the presentation on point, but everything tasted super fresh! We weren't super hungry so we ordered the ribs to share and man was it good! The meat just slid off the bones and it was garnished with slices of apricot and green onions! Mmmmm!! It was a fresh take on ribs and I loved it! The menu is very creative and the taste is def on par with the presentation! Def coming back next time I'm in SB!!","4784":"I finally made it to The Lark, after hearing chatter about it for some time. We had a reservation on a Monday night and were seated right away. The first thing that I noticed was the vibe. Plenty of outdoor patio seating with great lighting, firepits, and heaters everywhere. We started with drinks and an amazingly unique curry flavored popcorn which was complimentary. I would literally go back just for the ambiance and popcorn lol. The starters were my favorite. The brussel sprouts and rainbow carrots both had a touch of perfection and the oysters were fresh. I was impressed with all plating presentation and flavor pairings. I noticed a common theme of savory mixed with a little bit of sweet in almost every dish, only missing spice in my ultimate flavor trio. The service was friendly and fun, a little slow at times, but hey it was a monday night with probably a thinner staff. I was not impressed with the tune crudo, which was plain in flavor and texture, and the pork belly and fried chicken, were both good, but did not blow wind up my skirt, as I expected. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with the feel to the patio, satisfactory service, beautiful food presentation, and the strategic combinations of flavor and texture. I would absolutely go back and order off the FROM THE FARM menu, particularly, the crispy brussels sprouts, roasted rainbow carrots, and the caramelized cauliflower, which I saw on the table next to us and looked epic.","4785":"We found The Lark through Yelp and decided to give it a try when we visited Santa Barbara and it lived up to the hype! They have family share portions, one entree was more than enough to feed two of us. We got the fried chicken which was delicious, the Brussel Sprouts are also a must try!","4786":"2019 was the last time my friends and I dined here.  It was excellent then and still excellent now. The outside area is much bigger now, I noticed the menu selection lessoned, but there was still ampule to choose from. We had Saturday 7:00 p.m. dinner reservations, meeting another party of 2 there. Claudia P. our server was excellent! So nice and friendly and allowed us to catch up with old friends. She did not rush us at all but was still very attentive.\n\nNote: they make great cocktails! We had a few of the Ironwoods, Catherine's Lace and Cosmos. Food we ordered: Hawaij Mushroom Tartine, San Diego Big Eye Tuna Crudo, Grilled Caledonian Prawns, The Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Cast Iron Mediterranean Branzino. When the food came out, all fresh beautiful presentation and tasted fantastic! Love this place!\n\nAtmosphere: Trendy. Service: excellent. Food: excellent","4787":"Wow wow wow!!!\nThis place is amazing!\n\nCame here with my foodie friend after a disappointing visit to a different establishment. She already knew the menu here and said it's one of the best in Santa Barbara.\n\nOmg was she right!!! We quickly were shown to our seats at a community table which was available during a busy night. Making quick friends with our table neighbors, we ordered several cocktails and small dishes to share. Everything was absolutely outstanding, both in presentation and taste.\n\nOne of my top dishes was the nectarine and cucumber salad with house-made farmers cheese - a delightful combination of flavors, textures and colors. The oysters were fresh and delightful, the ahi tuna with pluots felt summery and innovative, the mushroom tartine tasted like fresh from the forest, and the olive oil cake was a great finish to our meal.\n\nI would come back anytime, either for drinks or food, and will highly recommend the restaurant to friends visiting the area. I'll be back!!!","4788":"We were SO IMPRESSED by The Lark. The atmosphere, service, cocktails, and food were fantastic, and the reasonable prices made everything sweeter.","4789":"I've been here before had an amazing experience for my birthday.\n\nCame here today for my friends 21st and I couldn't believe how bad my service was just because I told the host that we just wanted dessert and drinks. She would not give us a proper table. She would only give the option to sit at the communal table that was all full. I asked her twice and that was the only option she gave. I then pointed to one of the many empty tables outside and she said we could take that very passive aggressively.\n\nWe sat down only to be met with a very long wait for our server to greet us. I mentioned that it was my friends 21st and her first instinct was not to say \"Happy Birthday\" but instead \"ok\". Thanks. Found my napkin to be soiled and again met with poor attitude from the server.\n\nThe dessert was great. We had the goat cheese cheese cake and pumpkin fritters and they were so good, but we couldn't fully enjoy it as we felt almost embarrassed by how we were treated. So disappointing to have such poor human connection at a place I loved before. The lack of human connection\/experience will always be the reason I won't go back to a particular place.","4790":"Had a reservation for dinner and arrived on time.  Place was half filled but we waited for 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. In that 20 minutes, no one bothered to come over and even offer us water. There were 2 hosts\/hostesses chatting away near our table but they didn't seem to care about the customers. It is clear that the owner\/manager has not trained the staff properly and nobody seems to care much.","4791":"Unexpected and excellent. The menu was attractive but the flavors of the items explode in your mouth just like Ratatouille's.","4792":"Had an amazing dinner at Lark. Even on a rainy night, it was busy. Though we dined at the large communal table, so did not have to wait to be seated.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here. My friend and I shared an appetizer (crispy Brussels sprouts) , salad (autumn pears) & entree (grilled lamb belly) Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, though we saw some delicious desserts that others ordered such as the cheesecake with persimmons.\n\nService superb - our server went out of his way to get complimentary tea for my friend as they were out of the two she wanted.\n\nI highly recommend Lark if you happen to be in Santa Barbara - always a 5-star experience!","4793":"Definitely must visit in SB for lovely dishes that you can't find at most other restaurants. I love seeing fewer items on the menu, because that typically means fewer things to go wrong, and more time to craft each item.\n\nReservations - Make at least a couple days in advance. No walk-ins on Thursday May 6, 2021, only a wait list if the current reservations fall through. We put our name on anyways, and they called us 1 hour later to tell us there was an open slot. We were already eating by then but they said tomorrow Friday 8PM was available so we took it. We showed up almost an hour earlier and they seated us anyway. \n\nService - Very friendly, cheery, happy, and made us feel excited to be there.\n\nComplimentary lemon poppyseed popcorn - Extremely dangerous, avoid at all costs. How is that no table around us is eating this and we're inhaling this like butter?\n\nCrispy brussel sproputs (sesame, medjool dates, garum lime) - Very crispy, soft, and hollow. Salty and soggy.\n\nCaramel Cauliflower (harissa, lemon yogurt, marcona almonds, pickled kumquats, mint) - As incredibly saucy as this was, the flavors weren't that strong. Difficult to finish because it was so rich.\n\nCast Iron Mediterranean Branzino (muhamara, english peas, walnuts, charred lemon, pea tendrils) - Soft, gooey, falls apart in your mouth, with the perfectly crust skin.\n\nButtermilk Fried Chicken (smoked date caramel, amba aioli, pickled cucumbers, scallion) - Thick, chunky, deeply fried chicken that was dry on the outside, slightly juicy on the inside. \n\nNext time: Baharat Spiced Chickpea Tagine, California Delta Asparagus, Lamb Shawarma Rillettes, Crispy Pork Belly.","4794":"Logging on to write one of my first restaurant reviews since a scathing critique of an Ann Arbor spot (deserved) five years ago:\n\nFirst of all, gorgeous outdoor space with ample nighttime heating.\n\nEnjoyed and reordered the Nelson cocktail which was entirely refreshing. \n\nFood wise: \n- single oyster - spectacular vinaigrette on it. Wouldn't order a dozen, but a great starter \n- Brussels sprouts - some of the best I've had. You think you don't like fish sauce? You do. \n- tuna crudo - expected it to be delicious, and it was \n- salad - love a palate cleanser with a citrusy herb dressing \n- prawns - if anything, you have to get these. Scraped the sauce off the plate. Would come here every Friday for a plate of prawns and a glass of rose if I lived in Santa Barbara \n- beef cheek - so tender and tasty - garnished with pomegranate seeds, which cut the richness and added a zesty burst of flavor. Could do with a more interesting accompaniment than potatoes, but honestly hard to beat a classic combo.","4795":"Went to the Lark tonight. Was told to go to another bar cuz they're a \"boutique \" restaurant\/bar. What?  So glad our son decided no to have his reception there!  Business must be good if they can send people away....or they're just not business savvy!","4796":"Fantastic service. A+ in that department. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and free valet! The food - good, with artistic presentation and flavors. We ordered the brussel sprouts, artichoke and buratta cheese as well as the scallops. The brussel sprouts were doused in an Asian tasting flavors on top of the usual garlic and salted flavors. The buratta with artichoke was nice touch but way too acidic. The scallops we're good was well, and dressed with collared greens. The environment - disjointed. My GF had to sit in an awkward booth where the table kind of trapped her there in place - it felt very awkward. The prices - overpriced. $13 for brussel sprouts, $32 for three scallops. The value proposition does not exist at this place in my mind.","4797":"The Brussel sprouts and Cauliflower dishes are to die for.  The combination of sweet fruit flavours with savory vegetables is sublime.  I appreciate how well my young children were taken care of too.  Fries (perfectly cooked) and pasta from The Lucky Penny next door, along with a craft kit for each child.  Can't wait to go again and try another dish... but I will have to order the Brussels and Cauliflower again.","4798":"After 4 days of bad service and okay food, The Lark was a saving grace! Food was amazing and the service from server Oscar was exceptional! Given the extreme circumstances we are all under, The Lark is handling this time much better than all of our other dining experiences in Santa Barbara. So happy we came here our final night in town! Shoutout again to Oscar because he was awesome! Worth every penny!","4799":"I was finally able to try The Lark - it was highly recommended to me and did not disappoint. I made a reservation online ahead of time and was promptly seated. The menu is now digital and there is plenty outdoor seating. \n\nI started with the Deliverance cocktail, a tasty and smooth scotch drink - would highly recommend. For food, I ordered the mission fig tartine and the Spanish octopus. The mission fig tartine was an excellent appetizer. The goat cheese mouse was a nice touch that balanced all of the flavors. The Spanish octopus was tender and crispy. \n\nI enjoyed my meal and would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal or date night restaurant.","4800":"Tonight was my first time having dinner at this restaurant. Wow! I experienced some of the most taste bud blowing cuisines in my life. The carrot and Sea bass dishes were both amazing.\n\nThe ambiance was also very nice and warm. My waitress, Fawn, was awesome and I have her to thank for the food recommendations. \n\nThank you for such a wonderful and memorable dining experience in Santa Barbara.","4801":"SALT! SALT! SALT!  If you like creative, fresh, perfectly cooked California cuisine ruined by excessive salt, this is your place. \nIt takes a lot for me to write a negative review, namely a repetitive experience and the feeling I wouldn't want to go back there again. \nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer. It could have been one of the best preparations yet were it not so heavily salted. We next shared the couscous dinner course. So over salted. Following this we shared the halibut plate. The halibut was cooked to perfection. Shockingly the flavor was overwhelmed with salt!\nIf you are someone who routinely eats high salt foods, you may not think these dishes too salty. If you don't, you will be blown away. \nThree stars instead of one because the potential is so great with such a simple fix, and because the service was excellent.","4802":"Went here on a Friday night. It was buzzing. The ambience is fantastic. They have a mixture of \"tasting dishes\". We tried brussel sprouts, cauliflower, ahi tuna, beef cheeks, and salmon. The dishes were all very well prepared and very tasty. We had a mixture of cocktails and wine with the dishes. The service was great. Fantastic evening.","4803":"Thank you Sam and Annie for exceptional service and we celebrated by wife's bday! We had an amazing dinner outside on their patio and everything was perfect! From the Brussels sprouts, the little gem salad, the hanger steak, and even the bacon cheeseburger and fries my son had was perfection.... thank you to the kitchen crew and the staff as you made the perfect birthday dinner!","4804":"On par with the the best meal ever had. We loved the atmosphere and service was top notch. We had the steak, prawns, and pork chops as our entrees. Each was delicious with such a diverse flavor profile that the family style meal at The Lark was perfect for the exceptional mingling of flavors. We shared one of each dessert to round off the evening. Again, exceptional and crafted with excellence. We left well after everyone else had called it a night with no rush from the staff or pressure to leave. The Lark is gem and worth a visit.","4805":"Enjoyed dinner here on a beautiful Saturday night with the bestie.\nWe had a 7pm reservation and our table was ready right away. No reservations was a 2 hour wait so keep that in mind.\nThey have a nice bar area, outside patio dining and indoor dining with super chill lighting. \nWe shared a wedge salad and ribeye and had couple of cocktails and everything was excellent, even the service. \nIt is a little pricey, but I would return for a special occasion or special night out.","4806":"Where to begin... The food was incredibly on point -- my girlfriend and I split the fig tartine, tagliatelle pasta, fried chicken, and tres leches dessert -- every single dish was delicious and excellently proportioned. The atmosphere (despite Covid restrictions, which were observed) was comfortably, cozy and intimate. The drink selections were well-concocted, refreshing, and simply top notch!\n\nBut where my birthday experience was truly put over the top? Our server, Oscar. Despite the facemask, he was charming, personable, and delivered on every suggestion to enhance our experience. I have genuinely not had a more pleasant experience with a server, he put on a true master class in how to curate a dining experience for guests. HUGE Thank You to Oscar and the crew at the Lark for curating such an enjoyable evening!!!\n\nP.S. wish I had pics of the grub but no time for all that. Just... trust Oscar.","4807":"Great vibe. Deliciuce   food prepared with care. Bronzino out of this world. Talented chef. \nKelly and Hunter are keepers!!!","4808":"one star for the setting, it was stunning.  One star for the service- our waiter was great.  The food: disappointing and expensive.  With it's reputation, we ordered the sea bass dinner.  While good, it wasn't special....I actually thought that the fish wasn't seabass but something different.  In researching I have found that many types of white fish can fall under the Sea Bass label. It was a way to charge a premium for a dish. If you're expecting a firm white fish like Chilean sea bass, , don't order this, you'll be disappointed.  My vegetarian daughter ordered the Baharat chickpea tangine.  She said it was as if they opened a can of chickpeas and put it on the plate.  \n\nI would ONLY go if you can just order a drink and enjoy the setting.  Otherwise, there are MUCH better spots to support.","4809":"You have to go to this place! It's literally the best stuff I have ever ate. Everything we ordered was delicious and tasted amazing. \nFirst, we got a bowl of popcorn which were seasoned to perfection. It was a combination of slightly sweet and perfectly spicy. \nThen we got a corn bread that came with a chile honey butter with sea salt. This corn bread was so good! It was warm and and baked to perfection and that butter was the best! \nWe ordered a salad which had chunks of caramelized bacon, blue cheese, walnuts, and so much more. The dressing was delicious and they gave you the perfect amount of it. \nThen we got a beet salad with strawberries. This was so good! It was slightly sweet and the lemon vinaigrette gave the whole beet salad a delicious tang. It was a perfect combination with the soft beets and snap peas which gave the salad a nice crunch.  \nWe ordered two platters. We got the whole chicken which was seriously the best thing I have ever ate. The chicken was slightly sweet and it came on a bed of mash potatoes which were so soft and delicious. The sauce was slightly briny with chunks of olives scattered throughout. It was perfect with the grilled onions that added the perfect crunch. \nThe prime flat rib was really good too! It was cooked to perfection and was soft and flavored just right. It came with a whipped bone marrow butter that melted slowly on the tender pink flat ribs. I really liked how the thing was garnished too. It had fiddle heads and other vegetables on it. Also a beautiful flower was on top of it. \nWe got some drinks which were good too. We got the hummingbird, mule, and JP's Paloma. \nThe best one out of all those drinks was the hummingbird. It was made with grapefruit nectar and it had a really yummy egg white froth on top. It was garnished with rosemary and thyme which added a subtle herbal taste to the drink. \nThen I liked the mule which had a cucumber infused vodka with a house made ginger beer. This drink tasted fresh and tasted like it was made with real fresh ingredients. \nMy least favorite was the Paloma which had a strong tequila taste, but I did like the salt that lined the rim. \nThe only complaint I have is that our server said we should get around six dishes, but it was definitely way too much for us to finish. I think four dishes was perfect for us and I wished she was more honest about the proportions. \nSeriously everything here tasted delicious and everything looked so cute and pretty. I would definitely recommend this gem!","4810":"Went here for dinner on our first night in SB. Ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts (not the best I've ever eaten), very flavorful but not very crispy, as the name states. Everything here is mostly a share plate (for 2), so we got to sample a few things. Eggplant starter was amazing. Quite possibly the best thing we ate all night. For our main dish we had the ribeye. The baked beans were  amazing and had the most unique flavor topped with chives. The ribeye was cooked to perfection, ordered it medium rare, spot on. Overall very good dish. For dessert, we ordered the gooey butter cake. Amazing! Very different from a a traditional butter cake which is a bit crunchy and sugary on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. This one was all gooey and the blackened corn ice cream set the whole thing off. I could eat this every night. \n\nFew downsides, our server was lackluster and a bit aloof. He seemed like he didn't want to be there that evening and couldn't wait to go home. Was not forthcoming with suggestions, even though we told him it was our first time and we were visiting from OC. He also did not bring us out the popcorn (which was delicious) until we saw someone else get some at a table beside us and we asked for it.","4811":"This place is a MUST for dinner if you are in Santa Barbara! Great vibe and wonderful food and service! \n\n3 of us came for dinner on a Friday night. I would recommend getting reservations a couple of weeks in advance for the weekend. Also, I didn't see a lot of availability on Resy, but I called the restaurant and they were able to get us a spot. \n\nWe sat outside, which has a beautiful atmosphere of large plants between tables. They also have heaters for the chilly nights. Bar area inside seemed really crowded, so I'm glad we were outside where it was a little quieter and spread out. \n\nAs for food, they are a sharing menu, so don't plan on getting anything just for you. Everything, even the large plates are shareable. My recommendations:\n- Brussels sprouts \n- Nectarines and cucumbers\n- Grilled prawns\n- buttermilk fried chicken \n\nDrinks were also great and our service was excellent. Will definitely come back here next time I'm in town.","4812":"This place is definitely worth the hype! The complimentary popcorn was soooo good we ended up getting a box to go! Our favorite items were Galpin Farms Nectarines & Lemon Cucumbers and the buttermilk fried chicken. The nectarines\/cucumbers created such a cool refreshing salad-like appetizer. So light and airy!! Definitely would get that again! The chicken was refreshingly light and flavorful! Honestly I feel like you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Also the service was amazing! Our waiter made excellent recommendation!","4813":"The Brussel sprouts are amazing and the restaurant has a really nice ambiance. At night, the heater and fire was on so it made for a cute and cozy space. The food was great and the service was great as well. I tried the mule from the bar and it was delicious!","4814":"Very pricey for pretension. We had a to go order which was missing one entree but didn't realize until we got home. I called and was told I would be refunded, but that never happened. We therefore ended up paying $60 for an appetizer and a kids meal. Neither were particularly good.","4815":"Our new favorite restaurant, amazing variety and flavors abound. Pork belly is to die for and the prawns are the best I have ever had in my life and I don't like shrimp! I would return to Santa Barbara if only to eat at The Lark.","4816":"The crispy duck confit was delicious. Prices are reasonable. Menu has a nice variety. Atmosphere nice cozy and upbeat.","4817":"What a remarkable dining experience. While the food was some of the best I've ever had, it was surpassed by the superb service provided by Bill. He was both knowledgeable and friendly; I would even go as far as to say he was the best waiter I've ever had. Highly recommend the brussel sprouts and pork chop.","4818":"Mason J . was just a wonderful waiter. Came in for the experience and He was so informative and charming. Recommendations were fantastic.\n(Hi Skyler-Aaron And Drew say hello)","4819":"After a nearby restaurant cancelled our NYE reservations last minute that we had made weeks in advance, we were delighted to find this gem of a restaurant and spend our evening here - such a treat!  The food was magnificent and artistically paired and prepared.  The wait staff and kitchen was super focussed and created a wonderful evening for us from start to finish.  thank you!","4820":"I don't know that I can give an accurate representation of this culinary experience based on my personal discomfort. But the reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five was that the entrance was a little difficult to find and it wasn't an extensive menu. I was having some stomach upset and their ginger beer was delicious. Of what I could eat, I really enjoyed the Brussels and cauliflower. I would like to go back and have the full experience but I was glad we were able to walk and I got a postcard out of it! I am the type to actually write postcards and still have some of my lunar landing postage. Thank you!","4821":"This is one of the best restaurants I have been to. Period. Every single dish we ordered was absolutely delicious! The menu has Middle Eastern and Mediterranean-inspired ingredients excellently infused with American dishes. \n\nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts, which is the best we've ever had! They were glazed with a mind-blowing tangy, citrusy, and savory sauce that I literally couldn't stop eating. It was such a perfect balance and umami in my mouth, I kept eating just to try to pin point what made the sauce so addicting- and I couldn't! So point being order the Brussels sprouts- don't question it, it's amazing, and you won't regret it. \n\nWe also ordered the ahi tuna, which was so incredibly fresh and flavorful, the tuna melted in my mouth and I could tell it was a great quality ahi. We also ordered the peach salad, which was amazing as well! It was served with a light and creamy goat cheese - and I am not a goat cheese fan because I've only had the smelly kind and it put me off to goat cheese- however, this goat cheese had no smell and it was delicate in flavor and really tasty with the peaches. \n\nTo the dessert! The orange blossom olive cake! Order it or miss out on life. It's SO good...lovely cardamom notes that married beautifully with the orange blossom in a fluffy and super moist cake. It's so freaking delicious I really can't wait to come back just for this cake. Definitely our number one restaurant for a great romantic atmosphere and a delicious dinner.","4822":"This place doesn't need my review, because people already know how incredible it is. Every time I go, I leave full but knowing that I have quality food in my belly. Their menu changes often and has the most seasonal and fresh items. And they have always seated me by the warm fire pit, which I love. \nTheir seasonal fish crudo never disappoints and their cocktails are so refreshing and pretty. These pictures are a compilation of two of the times I've visited.","4823":"If I could I would give this fine establishment a - stars. I hate giving negative reviews but this one deserves it. Like another yelper commented in previous posts all the bad reviews are real believe them lol. Anyways we were already waiting in the front then the Asian hostess saw us standing outside for 20 minutes and let's everyone else sit down then comes out then says oh we won't have a table  for another 30 minutes then my fiance asks can you please text us we will be right up the street... ok that's cool we go to the  bar next door to kill time then decide to walk back after 17 minutes and there's a lot of tables available... the hostess\/girl was just rude and all the people that came behind us in line all had tables.... we ended up leaving because we were sitting at our tabLe a while.... oh and also whatever food they give in the beginning was gross.. thanks Lark I don't know what it was but that was not cool. We felt totally disrespected. Never been to a more terrible restaurant than this one it seems like the employees are not trained, do not like their job, or are condescending. Don't waste your time, energy, or money on this crappy place especially when Santa Barbara has many other spots with good food and service. We are from Pasadena and come to SB quite a bit... this place is nice to take pictures in and look at but that is about it.","4824":"I had been here before, about 5 years earlier. That said, I loved it then and I love it today. Clearly others do as well as restaurants can close up shop just as quickly as they open. Hopefully this one is around for the foreseeable future. \n\nFirst, you need to know this is an outdoor space regardless of Covid. It's a lovely garden vibe on a paring lot asphalt floor, but that's part of the experience I suppose. It's mixed with great service and the lights of an intimate garden by nightfall. They have umbrellas for shade and heat lamps \nfor warmth. \n\nSecond, consider one of their cocktails. I always go right for anything with Tequila, but the beer I hear is great also. They serve a popcorn of the day while you wait for your beverage to arrive. Prepare to have your eyes roll back like a shark. It's that good! Tonight's was bacon fat, scallion and fresh black pepper. \n\nThird and final is be sure to order the Fig Tartine\nif it's in season. This may arrive and have you thinking it's a dessert, but just wait. A wonderful combination of sweet and tangy, crunch and, well mush. So yummy. From here it's whatever the eater wants. We shared the octopus. Served on a hefty portion of squid ink a\u00efoli. If you do not like ink, this might not be for you and you can just ask them to omit it. I enjoyed the prawns for dinner, my hubby the fried chicken. Both were very good but I would give his a higher score solely based on my love of extra crunchy breading!  Both were seasoned perfectly. \n\nThe take away from this gem is that someone in the kitchen and management knows what they're doing. From preparation to presentation to service Lark is a great little eatery where Cali casual meets great food.","4825":"amazing! amazing service, food and wine! sit at the communal table and chat with your neighbors! Brussels sprouts are a must.  the rib eye is cooked to perfection, scallops on point and hamachi is stellar! must eat here!","4826":"The Lark was a very pleasant birthday dinner! It's a shared plate restaurant so we started with the Brussels sprouts and the vegetable tartine.  Both were delicious. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and sweet with bacon to balance the sweetness of the sauce. The tartine was unexpectedly delicious. The goats cheese and peas were perfect together and the vegetables were dressed in a tangy sauce. We finished with the olive oil cake and ice cream. The ice cream was delicious !!! I am definitely going again!","4827":"I've had great meals here but the last few times the menu has really gone down hill. Also the service has really declined. Very overpriced and not worth it. Would not recommend at this point.","4828":"Ambiance, lots of vegan and veggie options served family style. Those popcorn apps are soooo good too!","4829":"If I could give this place more stars I would. Went with my wife and kid. Super cool atmosphere. Maybe the best server I've had at a restaurant. I wish we got the guy's name because he was so helpful. Apps were good and we got the octopus which was very good but the stars of the night were the southern fried chicken and the pasta. Two of the most unique dishes I've ever had. This wasn't just a standard pasta dish or fried chicken. Both were amazing. The  fried chicken was just flipping awesome. It had a kind of bbq sauce that was outstanding. The pasta had to be fresh. It was probably the best prepared pasta I've ever had. I can't say enough good things about this place. I can't wait to go back.","4830":"What an excellent experience! Our waiter, Bill, was professional, engaging, anticipated our needs, and gave us first class service. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was hip and cozy. We had the risotto which was decadent and delicious. The hamachi crudo was a bright and interesting flavor palate","4831":"Yikes. I used to love it here. The Brussel sprouts were soggy and tasted like Chinese food. I love Chinese food but these were not good. The fish was bland and overpriced. Service was good but did not even ask why our food was barely touched. Just cleared the plates. Tried dessert and the spice in the olive oil cake was too overpowering. We didn't eat that either. Manhattans were very good but very small. Very expensive for this level of refinement. Second try post covid and not going back for a while after this.","4832":"Mediocre at best. Wasn't worth the $200 billion two people. Can someone explain to me why they had the quail on the menu? Worst dish ever. Our server tried to talk me out of it. We should have listened. Brussels were solid.  Chicken was 7\/10  but not higher. Worst part? Cassie the hostess called us and Left a message at 6:24 letting us know she was forfeiting our reservation... um we arrived early for our 6 pm reservation at 5:50 and were 3\/4 done with dinner. Rude!!!  Idk if we will return Honestly. Oh and I forgot. We ordered Dessert to go with they \"don't allow\" per our server so we could order it and box it ourselves. WTF. How can they offer regular take out but not allow dinners to order to go dessert? It's tres leches cake not ice cream that can melts Helpful Hint: tables are NOT six feet apart and there is no social distancing.","4833":"Arrived at 5:15PM for dinner.  The service was terrible.  Planned to have a birthday dinner with family, left after the appetizers, the burrata had too many strong flavors, the Brussels sprouts average.  \nMore annoyed by the server and his fake phony attitude.","4834":"The best dish we had here was the bone marrow crusted beef cheeks. IT IS A MUST. Everything on the plate was perfect, especially the grilled leeks. I didn't even mind the parsnip puree on the plate. That's how good it was. This was easily worth the visit.\n\nOther dishes we had there were, in my opinion, more average. We had the deviled eggs and the octopus (not a fan of the mushy grain it came with). The deviled eggs were good, but I would skip the octopus next time around. Many dishes are eerfect to share because the portions are quite a bit. It's a huge space with options both indoors and outdoors. We saw people on dates, friends hanging out, etc. so I would say it's a good place for any occasion.","4835":"Came here for dinner tonight and our experience was nothing short of AMAZING! \n\nService: Max was our waiter and he was truly phenomenal! He knew the menu so well and every one of his recommendations was 10\/10. Every course we had was perfectly timed out as well. \n\nFood: Would recommend 3-4 dishes for two people. We had the tuna crudo, nectarine cucumber salad, grilled prawns, and fried chicken.  Every item was so delicious but the standout for us was the crudo \n\nDrinks: I had a glass of Cabernet, and my boyfriend had their signature rye whiskey cocktail - both were delicious and went perfectly with our food. At the end of the meal we decided to share an espresso martini - this one was unique, not like others we've had before but still very delicious and we loved it nonetheless! \n\nWould HIGHLY recommend dining at The Lark when visiting Santa Barbara. We definitely can't wait to come back!","4836":"Am always amazed at the creativity of Chef Jason had an amazing starter Nectarines and Cucumbers. Tried the Prawns, Mussels , Branzino , Lamb , Pork Belly , Chicken. Chicken is always great. The Branzino with Fennel and corn amazing.. The Prawns with Tahini wow. With this food the adjectives flow freely . If u are in the area stop and enjoy Chef Jason and Chef Logans fare. You will not be disappointed.","4837":"Awesome awesome awesome....I felt truly awesome when I got served the heirloom tomatoes with buttermilk aioli, lark sauce and aragula.\nThe fried Brussels sprouts were also divine and the spicy popcorn were just palatte blowing but in a good way as I love flavours.\nVisited this evening for a quick drink at the bar and fell in love with this intimate wine bar. \nService was good and attentive.\nI will travel to Santa Barbara just to eat here.","4838":"I made reservations after reviews on Yelp were good. I wanted to show the wife a special evening after 41 years of marriage. I showed up thirty minutes early. Understandably we could not be seated early and was told they would have to stick to the reservation. I should have known my evening was being sabotaged when as I waited I ordered a glass of wine at $14. It was awful. I accepted a bartender replacement recommendation which I learned afterwards was $21 a glass.\nWe were told that we could be seated. As we are standing waiting to be seated, the hostess said give her a minute to clean the table. As we waited, minutes later the hostess comes back and tell us the table is no longer available since the couple sit back down at the table.\nMy wife is now agitated but I tried to remain calm. Fifteen minutes later we were again told we could be seated. I finally lost it when the hostess tried to seat us in the very last table in a back corner next to the bathroom exit. The table was placed so close to another table that one of the chairs could not be pulled out to be seated.\nWe decided to get the hell out there. However my wife insisted on speaking to the manager. She was very apologetic and wanted to make this right. She provided  appetizers and a glass wine while we waited to be seated once again. Once seated, the table was much better.\nThe menu was very limited. I ordered what I thought was a \"Dungeness Crab\" dish and my wife ordered what she thought was salmon. Both dishes were scams. The $34 plate of rice hidden under mounds of salty stuff and one bite of crab. No kidding I looked for the crab. My wife's $24 plate of salmon was actually a salmon spread served with bread. To say that we were disappointed is a under statement.","4839":"Had a phenomenal dinner here on Saturday with my husband and daughter, who is 7.  \n\nOur waiter was one of the best waiters we've ever had- he was attentive, made great suggestions and really enhanced the overall experience.  We had the Fig Tartine (which was unique and delicious), the octopus, the fried chicken (which was INSANELY good) and the Tagliatelle pasta (which was so fresh and bright).  If you're looking for a nice meal in SB, I highly highly recommend coming here!","4840":"Nothing bad to say. Unfortunately, I've forgotten our server's name but she was knowledgeable and professional. She had excellent timing and was never overbearing but still available for all of our needs. The entire team was working hard but smiling and professional. The manager took the time to come over and ask us questions about our trip and to ensure that we were enjoying everything. This really made us feel special.\n\nThe presentation of every dish should be a photo in an art gallery. The tuna, the salad, all of it. Breathtaking to look at, you don't even want to eat it! Until that first bite, then it's all you want to eat. Amazing flavor. We shared the seabass. We're from the bay area where I'd like to think the seafood is overall unparalleled. Guess I was wrong. The bass was luscious and meaty but not at all dry. It had a bit of spice to it as well. If we ever end up down this way again, we'll be back without a doubt. \n\nThank you to the entire staff for an incredible experience! Couldn't have been better.","4841":"Such a great atmosphere and amazing food and drinks!!!! My favorite place to eat!!!! Our waiter was absolutely amazing and funny, the food was delicious and the energy was wonderful! It made for a wonderful Father's day!","4842":"Three words: Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  By far, this was the best dish we had that night.  Besides the Brussels sprouts, the highlight of our meal was the service. Our server was simply fantastic.   He was very helpful in getting us through the menu and was very fun to talk to.  The other dishes we ordered, Spanish octopus and the steak was above average.  The drinks were also very interesting.","4843":"One Word:  AMAZING!\n\nI have been wanting for this place to open for some time now, so the anticipation was built up.  Thankfully they nailed it.\nMake a reservation, as this place fills up quickly.\nWe arrived and valet service was provided right outside the restaurant, which is very convent, as the Funk Zone can get busy at times.\nWe were greeted at the door, by a very friendly staff and were seated immediately.\nWe started with a glass of the Nebbiolo, which was fantastic.  \nWe shared a couple items for the meal:\nHalf dozen blue point oysters, which really hit the spot.\nLittle Gems Wedge, which has to be the best salad I have had in a long time.  The chicory glazed bacon was incredible, definitely would love to see a BLT with this on the lunch menu.\nRoasted Mary's Chicken, with brown butter polenta, warm spinach, blackened fig, chicken jus.  This was so tender and juicy, it all just melted in our mouths.\nWe sat outside on the patio, which was very nice as well.  They have really taken the time to use some very interesting decorating.  From what looks like old sinks or bathtubs, filled with plants, to the succulents mounted like picture frames.\nOverall we had an exceptional time, the Staff was very observant, friendly and ready to serve.","4844":"A brief update to say the second visit was just as great as the first. Tonight Oscar served us and he was wonderful, very attentive. Breana came by to say hi too! \n\nI seriously can't get enough of their popcorn. It's served like bread or chips would be prior to the meal. \n\nYou have got to try the Whipped Sheep's Feta and pistachio dip. We had the chili oil put on the side, since I can't eat it. It's delicious without, I imagine it's just as delicious with. It's creamy with just the right amount of salt.","4845":"O.M.G this place was sooo good. Even the lemon poppyseed popcorn they served at the table was delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. The drinks were phenomenal and the fig bread was mind blowing. I'd eat 10 of those! The service was amazing as well. Next time in SB we will be back","4846":"Cute place with good vibes. Nice to see a modern, well-designed place in SB. \nI really loved the brussel sprouts (super flavorful and crispy), and the wedge salad was a tasty treat. \nUnfortunately my scallops were bland and some of them seemed undercooked which is a big turn off to me. I had to send them back. I will definitely try a different entree next time.","4847":"Great food, good atmosphere. I heard that there palomas were phenomenal and even though I'm not a tequila person I really enjoyed it. I thought the oysters were a little pricy for what they. We also ordered the chicken and the heirloom tomatoes. All in all it was a really good dinner.","4848":"Absolutely delicious! Our waiter was great and the recommendations were honest and perfect!!! Would definitely go back. :-)","4849":"Briana is fantastic! Request her when making your reservations. She is super knowledgeable, kind, and funny.  She took care of our friend who has strict dietary restrictions and made great recommendations all night long. Thanks, Briana!","4850":"I've been working in Restaurants for 10 years (thank god it's coming to an end lol) and 7 of them in high end steakhouses, but last night was one of THE BEST experiences I've EVER had thanks to Wyatt and the entire staff at The Lark.\n\nThe lady & I drove up for the weekend from LA to celebrate our anniversary. We made a resos at here on Friday and Wine Cask for Saturday (good luck to them after last nights experience here.)\n\nSat nearly right away for our 7:45 at what felt like to us the best table outside next to the fire.\n\nComplimentary round of Prosseco for the occasion. \n\nNow a days everyone has Brussel sprouts but good god the ones here with figs here were THE BEST ever! \n\nNever have I had nor do I expect to have better (maybe unless I go to Italy) gnocchi . Theirs had Dungeness crab and OH MY GOD IT WAS DIVINE! \n\nLastly, Hats off to Wyatt. His service was friendly, prompt, knowledgable and professional! Mine and the ladies jaw dropped when he told us his age! Cougars beware! \n\nAgain hats off to everyone for making it a dinner to remember!","4851":"We reserved a table here last Saturday for my sister's bachelorette party. The food was great and the service was prompt and friendly. Their drinks were incredible and we enjoyed ourselves. \n\nOur only issue is that in their description of their plates they call it 'family style' serving when they mean it's just tapas\/small plate... We didn't mind the price as we were there for a good time, but it could be considered a bit of a shock if one brought a large party expecting 'family style' portions and received small plate servings.","4852":"We had great experience with food here. I personally love the beef tarta serve with beer after a bite. So special to have such a great seat with great views and vibes at this restaurant. Really enjoyed it.","4853":"We ate here last night after it was highly recommended by friends.  I came with high expectations based on the reviews and the prices, but those expectations unfortunately were not met.  I wish I would have spoken up about the main entree, which was the seared sea bass because it was beyond seared and lacked flavor.  It was dry. While I typically don't write negative restaurant reviews, for this particular experience I felt I needed to do so because when you are are going to charge these prices, it needs to be perfect every time.  The sea bass wasn't the only part of the meal that tasted off, the wedge salad was so heavily soaked in dressing, that we left half of it uneaten and I personally did not care for the huge, tough bacon chunks.  The only saving grace of this dining experience were the Brussels sprouts which were to die for, but I'm not so sure that a decent Paloma and Brussels sprouts would be enough to ever bring me back.  This experience made me feel that all the positive reviews are over-hyped.","4854":"Very good restaurant in Santa Barbara's funk zone. The menu is creative and daring - I appreciate the effort to think outside of the box and give diners a new eating experience. We ordered the \"tajine\", the lamb rillettes, and the salanova lettuces. Each was very good.\n\nInteresting vibe at The Lark. Definitely a scene, not necessarily a relaxing spot, but can be engaging if you want to bring a lot of your own energy.","4855":"The best restaurant we ate at in Santa Barbara. Every dish was excellent. Brussels sprouts were some of the best I had and the olive oil cake which we ate to fast to picture was also delicious.  The cauliflower was also another must try.","4856":"We met with friends and planned for bite out dinner. and one of them recommended this restaurant. Very good place for outdoor dining. Roomy, comfortable, and great service. It was a great green place that I just fall in love at the moment we entered. I couldn't imagen to have heavenly delicious food in ambiance like heaven, totally out of my expectations.\nSo we ate and enjoyed some truly exceptional food. We are absolutely satisfied with the service and food. Their staff was also very professional and friendly. The place was very clean and organized. It was a remarkable experience!\n\nHighly recommend this spot it really worth a visit, you will become a regular once you experience your first visit here.","4857":"From the moment we sat down until we finally got up to leave, the service here was simply wonderful. The food is amazing and great patio al fresco.","4858":"Nice cure for appetite and good conversation. Service is GREAT.","4859":"Great all around experience! We had two openings - the squash Fuji apple and the Brussels sprouts - the squash won the round but both were good. We finished with scallops and pork. The scallops cooked perfectly and the pork was very tender! The service was great and the cocktails were a great touch!","4860":"Absolutely Amazing! My second time here after 6 years and it did not disappoint. I loved absolutely everything we ordered on the seasonal menu. I thought I knew what to expect but I felt like everything seemed to have a twist on the usual. Each dish held surprises- very subtle touches- a combination of flavors that delighted the palate.\n\nthis is the place to sit and enjoy every bite, to be surprised and to bask in the moment. Impeccable service- worth every penny!","4861":"The food is mediocre for what you pay relative to similar priced restaurants.  They were out of most things we asked for.  The service was bad, the waiter did not know much about the menu.  Seems like a really trendy place that focuses way too much on ambiance and not enough on the fundamentals.","4862":"A Chef inspired menu that celebrates the flavors of California's central coast. \n\nWalking into The Lark felt pleasantly familiar to me. From the interior to the indoor and outdoor seating areas and even the long Bar beckons memories from Los Angeles's highly praised Bestia. The menu is served a la carte family style - anyone in Orange County would instantly think of Santa Ana's Playground. If you are being compared to restaurants such as these, you are obviously getting something right. And, just as these direct comparisons also have, The Lark employs the European seating arrangements I so deplore as fellow diners seem to be sitting literally in your lap which can come with unintended consequences. More on that later.\n\nThe Lark showcases the work of Executive Chef Jason Paluska formerly of Anchor & Hope and Michael Mina's RN74 fame. The menu is broken up into segments highlighting the ingredients being employed. Think: From the Land, From the Sea, From the Farm, et al. 2 to 3 orders should feed a table of two and naturally the bigger the crowd the more you will order. Prices range from $7.00 to $40.00 per plate and there is are ample Wine, Craft Beer, and Mixology options for those ready to imbibe. \n\nOur table kicked off dinner with the Rosemary & Brown Butter Cornbread that is served with Aleppo Chile Honey Butter and has a welcome saltiness to it thanks to the generous use of Sea Salt. The crumble was perfect and with the Bread being served in a cast iron pan you know the bottom is nice and browned. \n\nIf you are a fan of Pasta see no further than The Lark's Hand Cut Pappardelle which boasts English Peas, Hen of the Wood Mushrooms, Sugar Snap Peas, Piedmont White Truffle, Pine Nuts, and Parmesan shavings. The balance of this Pasta is incredible - no worries about the overuse of Truffle so common in the last few years - each ingredient is well represented. I wouldn't think to order Pasta at a Gastro, but I will going forward. \n\nThere was no way I would leave The Lark without being able to say I have tried their 72 Hour Marinated 8 ounce Prime Flat Iron which came heavily suggested by the concierge at the Hotel I stayed at in Santa Barabra and it was the easily the star of the meal. The thick cut Steak is prepared to an expert Medium-Rare and served with Caramelized Gigante Beans, grilled Zucchini & Spring Onion, a confit of Heirloom Tomato, crispy Sweet Peppers, and a Black Garlic 'Bordelaise' to dip the Steak in to take things to the next level. This offering really shows off the culinary chops the kitchen exhibits and is a must try if you find yourself in the Funk Zone of downtown Santa Barabra. \n\nThe meal was fantastic, of that, there is no question. The only downer was the aforementioned European-style seating. I get it - this is to encourage you to engage with those around you (or a lousy way to squeeze in an extra table or two on the floor) - but the fact is I don't always want to know those I am dining amidst. Case in point: at the table next to mine sat a couple of the ugliest, rude, and ignorant diners I may have ever experienced. They were talking down the kitchen, the city of Santa Barabra, and those around them throughout their visit and because I was 2 feet away from their conversation I was forced to listen to the constant flow of negativity. I even asked for the check early just to make the mindless drivel come to an end. \n\nLook, if you know you are an unpleasant and relatively unhappy person just do not travel or dine out. It is better for everyone involved. \n\nObviously, the world's douchebags are no fault of the kitchen but being forced to endure those at neighboring tables almost outshined the cuisine itself. If this may be an issue for you, it may be worth the wait to secure one of the 3 booths available. That will be my strategy upon return. \n\nThe Lark is easily the best Gastropub concept I have enjoyed in the Central Coast.","4863":"I know I've already reviewed The Lark a couple times, but every meal I've had here has been noteworthy, including the most recent, four years after our last dinner--four years that encompassed a global pandemic and the birth of our child, both events that have only made me love a good restaurant even more. The Lark may be the best in town. It's certainly my go-to recommendation whenever friends visit Santa Barbara. \n\nWe'd been wanting to go back ever since we got vaccinated in April, but predictably, it's almost always booked up during reasonable hours. Our dinner, at 8:45 on a Monday night last month, was a special treat, and we enjoyed every minute.\n\nWe ate indoors, and the space and service and atmosphere were as we remembered, all very pleasant and exemplary. The Lark's bar is as much of a draw as the food, and I loved both of the cocktails I ordered. The Yankee Point was a lovely daiquiri, made with Wray & Nephew, Denizen white rum, lime, strawberry, and sumac. The Summerland was a beautiful, balanced sour, with Old Overholt bonded rye, Amaro Averna, summer peach, lavender, and lemon.\n\nThe food was delicious. We started with oysters on the half shell and the bigeye tuna crudo, both outstanding. The oysters came with watermelon granita, finger lime, and basil, and the tuna in a cool, spicy fermented Fresno chile broth with black sesame, stone fruit, and Thai basil. The next thing to hit the table was a board of Mary's free range duck liver mousse, served with saffron apricots, spicy Iranian pickles, and olive oil crostini. This was a lavish portion of rich, flavorful duck liver mousse with a colorful variety of pickles, which is always what I want with my charcuterie. Grilled Caledonian prawns were meaty and succulent, prepared with black lime, tahini yogurt, cilantro zhoug, compressed cucumber, and mint. Don't sleep on those juicy heads. The centerpiece of our dinner was the grilled prime hanger steak. The steak was perfectly cooked, a rare silky red through the middle, sliced and served over a platter of blistered shishito peppers, smoked beef tallow emulsion, sungold tomato, and crispy Thai basil. We had some vegetables left over (since Matt doesn't eat many vegetables), and I had them with salmon later in the week and they made that easy at-home dinner feel positively luxurious. For dessert, we shared an olive oil cake with jam, peaches, nougat, and ice cream. The least memorable part of our meal but still great.\n\nWe had a stellar time at The Lark and can't wait to come back, hopefully before four more years have passed. It's never disappointed us, and I don't expect that it ever will.","4864":"Food was good but not fall off my seat as it seems from some reviews. Hats off to the oysters and the beet salad (sooo good) . I give it a 4 star cause it's good quality for the area.\n\nSome notes:\n\nWe had the desert olive oil cake (I've had much better) and the cheese dip also good but not spectacular\n\nService was good, but i felt as the Servers explained the dishes it was in the \"go\" very quick, not much heart into it and because the company may have told them they have to describe foods... felt a bit bland. Besides that excellent wine selection but not somewhere I'd run and go back to. Regardless excellent service i thank you all for all your help and keep at it!","4865":"Off of recommendations from our server John-the duck confit was amazing. Duck is definitely not a staple for us, but this was beyond our expectations and the grits perfectly compliment the crispy duck. Worth a try if you're in the area. Would definitely come back.","4866":"Offensively expensive.  So-so cuisine.  Would you like to speak with a knowledgable sommelier and maybe get good value for your wine dollar?  Then don't go here.","4867":"Came in for a snack w my girlfriend ended up w the best Brussels we've ever had. After that the lamb kabob. Also best we've ever had. Hunter was wonderful recommended both the items and got us setup w cocktails to match. Definitely coming back","4868":"Have you ever truly enjoyed every single dish you ordered? I did last night at dinner at The Lark. And we ordered a lot. \n\nCurry popcorn: Complimentary. To be honest, the flavor profile on this did not impress me, but it is addicting. Everyone at my table kept reaching for more until it was all gone.\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts: Wow! I don't even like brussels sprouts, but the crispy outside and the squeezed lime juice complements the sesame and date flavors so well.\n\nNectarines and Lemon Cucumbers: This tasted so fresh and was such a good starter. The combination of the citrus from the nectarine and the lemon cucumber dipped into the creamy farmers cheese made for a delicious bite.\n\nTuna Crudo: Surprisingly enough so each person in my party of 5 had an individual large piece of fresh tuna to enjoy. The orange was a nice touch to balance the fish. Even the olive was good by itself!\n\nBranzino: The cast iron grilled skin was a crispy outer shell for the soft flavorful fish. Don't forget to  eat it with the pea tendrils.\n\nButtermilk Fried Chicken: Hands down this was my favorite dish. The pieces were huge (not skimpy at all) and so so juicy. The caramel and aioli elevated this dish to another level.\n\nPrime Hanger Steak: The slices were so tender and paired well with the emulsion. I skipped the shishito peppers (which my friends were readily and happy to eat for me).\n\nOrange Blossom Olive Oil Cake: Light, soft, delicious.\n\nMango Lassi Panna Cotta: Sweet and smooth.\n\nTIP: Call for reservations if none are available online. That's how I made my reservations for a party of 5.","4869":"Wonderful date night. Food was so wonderful! We enjoyed everything. Fried chicken and mushroom toast were favorites of the night. Portions are generous. Service was warm and helpful. Patio is also beautiful!!","4870":"Put our name in for a table outside. Sat at the bar to grab a drink while we waited, best decision because Jason at the bar is absolutely incredible. Told us stories behind specific liquors and just an all around great guy. Truly made our evening. After about 45 minutes we were seated at a tiny little table squeezed in between two other tables. Not the greatest spot after waiting 45 minutes but we dealt. Ordered the crispy Brussels, Hope Ranch mussels & the big eye tuna crudo. The Brussels were great, a little on the sweet side but the texture was crispy and portion was good. I wouldn't order the tuna crudo again. The Hope Ranch mussels were a show stopper. The creme fraiche\/white wine sauce was unreal. The peppers & roasted tomatoes with big fresh mussels worked so well together. I would order that over and over again. Service was great, cocktail were great. Definitely a good spot for appetizers and drinks!","4871":"Took a short weekend trip to SB, I was looking forward to ending the day with a delicious meal.... unfortunately things did not end well. For a restaurant with such good reviews and was recommended by so many, I was extremely underwhelmed. \n\nThe combination of ingredients in their dishes just don't pair well in my opinion. My tastebuds were confused and not happy \n\nSaddest part of my night- the A5 wagyu was as chewy as a piece of ribeye. They should not advertise this as wagyu, nothin tender about it. \n\nI'm still upset we wasted our night out at the Lark.","4872":"my husband and I were able to get away for the weekend and so happy we found this little place. We had the Larkboard cheese platter and apple cobbler . We had great service as well, can't recall our servers name?  he was super sweet and attentive.","4873":"Salad was a delicious surprise (coming from a carnivore)!  And, it was a take out dinner and it was still good.  Definitely worth a return trip.","4874":"Went in with no expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. Went here with my best friend, but this is definitely a good restaurant for dates and small adult groups (hint: not aimed towards kids at all). The dishes are meant to be shared and they have a decent wine and cocktail selection. Definitely catering to a more sophisticated and subtle palate. \n\nWe weren't starving when we went so we just ordered this arugula and persimmon salad and pappardelle pasta. The salad was delicious, but the pasta was AMAZING. Probably one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. \n\nSupposedly, The Lark and Lucky Penny are owned by the same person. You would NEVER know judging by the food. A year ago I had the worst pizza I ever had in my life, at Lucky Penny. I am no glad I didn't know it was the same owner going in, or else I wouldn't have bothered. \n\nBy the way, our server, Nolan, was adorable. The service great altogether, but Nolan seems like such a chill dude. I would definitely return again, the next time I am in SB.","4875":"I forgot to take pictures of my meal but O M G the food is sooooo good! My sister recommended this place to me and said pretty much everything on the menu is good. She was not wrong - it did not disappoint. I think the menu is seasonal and changes often. I got a pasta dish with corn\/tomatoes, and short ribs and it was honestly so good :')\n\nI would say this place is on the pricier side but so worth if you are in SB. The wait is also long for dinner so definitely try to make a reservation. Take out was very quick! Took about 15 mins to get our food.","4876":"GET THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS!!! Charcuterie board!!! And the tartine toast!!! Best dinner in SB!!!","4877":"Came on a Monday night at 7 and it was packed! Definitely need to make reservations. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Our waitress was really friendly and highlighted some menu items for us. She asked if we wanted still or sparkling water and I will say we were pretty shocked to find that a small bottle of kopu sparkling water cost $8.50 when we got the check!! But that aside...\n\nThe food. We got the crispy brussel sprouts, caramelized cauliflower and the buttermilk fried chicken. The brussel sprouts were sooo good. Deep fried and crispy! It was topped with this sweet\/salty fish sauce combination that was delicious. The cauliflower is tossed in harissa and was a salty contrast to the sweeter golden raisins. The almonds added a nice crunch factor but not that much flavor. I was honestly expecting a little more in terms of flavor but it was still enjoyable. The fried chicken portion is huge. It comes with five chicken thighs that are deep fried and sit on an aioli and topped with a smoky caramel sauce. Good flavor and perfectly breaded and fried chicken but nothing to write home about. \n\nThey have a huge wine menu but maybe only 5 or 6 that they serve by the glass. I did get to try a carbonic syrah which I had never heard of before which was cool to experience. They let you taste the wine before committing to a glass as well.","4878":"Great service! Food was mixed reviews, we loved the Brussels sprouts, the fig dish, and the pea dish, but the prawns were OK. Also this was a small plate restaurant so we all shared everything family style. Drinks were bomb and so was the service. Very cute atmosphere as well and we sat at the community table (which we reserved 20 minutes before arriving- pro tip!)\n\nWould come back and a great place for lunch\/ dinner.","4879":"Excellent food service and craft cocktails \nUnusual flavored popcorn instead of bread bread basket was a delicious surprise \n\nThe only negative was the hangar steak was served with a pile of whole shishito peppers- filled with seeds \nToo many peppers in my opinion - they could have added a different veggie to vary\nI don't think anyone could actually eat that many \n Overall if was a four star plus experience","4880":"The Lark is THE HOT Spot in Santa Barbara that everyone is talking about these days.  I had heard so much good about this place I was eager to try it out.  And unfortunately came away feeling let down and not sure what ALL the fuss is about.  The Lark is located in the FUNK ZONE also a very hot spot in town, but I did not have a chance to explore it as I was on my way to LA when we stopped in for dinner (with reservations, of course because otherwise I hear you WILL WAIT).  A funky, cool decor and a large Thursday night crowd.\n\nWe were seated at a two person table in a row of two person tables.  The dining room is loud and a lot of our dinner conversation was \"what?\" and \"say again?\"  And they had trebly 'funk' music (btw- I really like funk music, but it was out of place and unnecessary here) playing in the background and just added to the noise chaos.   The service was good, cheerful and prompt.  The food, served in plate sharing style, was somewhat of a let down though.\n\nWe ordered the crispy brussel sprouts--deep fried with sesame oil and dates.  They were good, but not great (see SIDECAR in San Luis Obispo for the gold standard 'great'). The dish had meejol dates which added sweetness to it.    We followed up with a very underwhelming Spring Veggie Tartine.  Perhaps I don't properly understand what this was supposed to be, it was beautiful to look at, but it was bland and tasteless--the green sauce was what exactly?-- it just added nothing to the plate.  So I quickly ordered the wedge salad which was the best thing we had that day.  Four generous portions of romaine hearts with bleu cheese, bacon and just yum.  I highly recommend that one.  Then we finished up with the heralded MARY'S ROAST CHICKEN THAT so many have Yelped about...  good, but again not great..the grits were plentiful but pasty, the roasted corn was pretty tasty (but not enough of it) and the chicken was definitely NOT the 'moistest and most tender' as other people have related.  \n\nOur bill for that meal with the $25 corkage (we brought a very nice Costa de Oro Pinot with us) and tip was $130.   So there you have it... The Lark gets A For effort, B- for the follow through.  Jane is still my favorite in SB--along with Bouchon, Olio Limone and Ca'Dario.","4881":"we stopped by for dinner on a weeknight and were seated right away without a reservation (although we preferred patio seating so im not sure if there was a wait to sit indoors). patio had plenty of overhead heat lamps and an enclosed firepit.\n\nwe started off with drinks- i had a lazy daisy and other family members had glasses of local pinot grigio. i wasnt crazy about the cocktail but i just expected it to taste sweeter than it did. the popcorn snack they brought out was tasty, lightly tossed in spices, and a nice start to dinner.\n\neverything was shared\n- brussel sprouts: an original signature dish, it was really packed with flavor. the diy lime squeeze was the perfect punch of acid for the dish. it did get a little salty as you got down to the scraps at the bottom of the bowl but was still balanced by the sweetness.\n- beet & burrata salad: nicely cooked beets, loved the crispy puffed rice for added texture on the burrata. the dish was so light and fresh.\n- hamachi crudo: this was my favorite dish! incredible flavors... the passionfruit and coconut cream was so tasty that i would have licked the plate if it was socially acceptable. i started to dip some of the beets in it too and it was amazing.\n- papardelle: wide cut noodles cooked perfectly al dente in a delicious black truffle butter sauce. solid pasta dish.\n- lamb ribs: well cooked, tender off the bone, strongly spiced rub finished with sweetness. i love cornbread but was a little disappointed by this one... it was dry and ive had better. this is one dish i would skip next time to try the steak tartare or pork belly. but on the other hand, 2 other diners at my table who usually dont like lamb found this dish to be one of their favorites.\n\noverall a really great dinner experience. my takeaway impression was that each bite was packed with tons of flavor.","4882":"Came here during covid times and so glad we did! Fianc\u00e9 surprised me with reservations.  Amazing food! Seriously, anything I tasted was just perfect!  Plus, it's in Santa Barbara's Funk Zone so you can walk anywhere after dinner!! \n\nOysters and Brussels sprouts are to die for!  Being the whiskey snob that I am I had to try the Deliverance (yes, I know it's scotch).  It was soooo good!!  We both had the hanger stake and loved it!","4883":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here years ago and we are still talking about how amazing it was. The menu was amazing. Every item was a good selection.","4884":"A good experience for some LA-esque cuisine to diversify options near the Funk Zone, but there are better dinner options around the area. \n\nAtmosphere\/Decor: dark and buzzing dinner location. Some warm light throughout the restaurant. Nice warming stations outside on the deck this time of year. Quaint yet somehow spacious. \n\nService: Very attentive though trailed off a bit towards the end of the meal. Helpful narration of the menu and the concept (shared plates) by the server. \n\nFood: Some outstanding fresh and vibrant dishes on the main plates. All the salads had flavor that jumped off the plate. There was a very nice crispness to the beet salad, and I liked the popped wild rice to add to the texture of the dish. The hamachi crudo was very well done, fairly decent amount of hamachi, and had a real nice kick to the dish. The coconut foam\/cream was a refreshing change of pace for this traditional dish. The cheese plate was alright -- humboldt fog and some mimolette -- decent portion of mimolette, fair to small of humboldt fog, would have liked either more of the latter or a third cheese to spice it up. Granny smith apples, cashews, and very mild house-made honey mustard -- meh. Not sure I'd get it again, as I have had more inspired cheese plates for $18. \n\nDrinks: I had the Matador and found it very zesty and appetizing. I didn't taste the scotch hardly at all which was both great and made me wonder how much was used. \n\nPrice: Average to a tad higher than other nice restaurants in the area. \n\nI'd go back if friends were eager to try it, especially since some folks in the past year seemed to have much better experiences. I'd likely venture out to try new restaurants, otherwise. I'd be more likely to pull up a seat at the bar for a drink and maybe a single plate for a small bite.","4885":"We hadn't been back to the Lark since the Covid thing hit.  We went back Saturday night and it was fantastic.  The food was some of the best we've ever had in Santa Barbara.  Somehow their bar which used to make the worst Manhattans on the planet made a perfect one.  Did they move the bartender from Les Marchand over to the Lark?  It's the only thing that explains it because he was great. Already made reservations to go back.","4886":"We started with a couple drinks and some bread. The wedge salad was very good. First course the prawns were so so.  Then it got really good maybe top 3 of all time. The pasta dish and the pork chops were INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!  Topping it off with a great desert.","4887":"Great experience at The Lark. The outdoor setting was beautiful, the food was creative and well executed, the cocktails were amazing and the servers were extremely gracious. Our server was John and he gave, hands down, the best description of menu items I've ever heard.... an artist! Every dish we had was spectacular: Brussels sprouts, the fig tartine, the half chicken and the trout. The vegetables were farmers market fresh and every ingredient added something special to the dish. Please go to The Lark next time you are in Santa Barbara.....a definite bright spot in this COVID-19 year.","4888":"I was very excited to introduce my daughter to my favorite restaurant on her 19th birthday, and The Lark didn't disappoint. We started off with the famous addictive popcorn, the Brussels sprouts and then had the hand cut tagliatelle and fried chicken. All were delicious! The staff made my daughter feel special without embarrassing her. We may make this a new yearly ritual .","4889":"Stopped by for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised by the ambience and the popcorn. The scallops were amazing and the wait staff super nice and helpful.","4890":"So nice to be able to enjoy an evening out with family.  Perfect seating location, delicious food to share, and great service.","4891":"The Lark may be my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara!!!\n\nDecided to celebrate my anniversary dinner here and it was a great choice! I was greeted with ros\u00e9 and a personalized card from the restaurant which was a nice touch. \n\nThe complimentary popcorn is so flavorful, I can't grasp the seasonings but feel free to ask for more because you will want more!\n\nOrdered: \n\n- Big Sur ($14) - California gin, lime, passionfruit, amaro angeleno, lager - really refreshing and tasty!\n\n- Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($13) - the best brussels sprouts I've ever had! I couldn't stop eating them. If you like sweet, you will definitely enjoy them too! \n\n- Little Gems 'Wedge' ($16) - not a fan of blue cheese but didn't even taste it. The spicy walnuts really make the salad!\n\n- Hand Cut Tagliatelle Pasta ($26) - amazing pasta with a slight kick. \n\n- 8oz Creekstone Prime Hanger Steak ($42) - I wasn't too impressed with the steak as it was a little bland. Looking back I should've just ordered the ribs. \n\nParking - is only street parking (on State street)\n\nTIP - definitely make a reservation on TOCK. \n\nOverall - I was very satisfied with my experience at The Lark and can't wait to come back the next time I'm in SB. \n\nPLUS - this is 100th Yelp review! Woohoo!","4892":"Meh. Overall, I think the menu and service are overrated. But two stars because the valet parking was a nice start to the evening - the young man who helped us was super friendly and definitely earned a generous tip! Kudos to him. The bartender wasn't too bad either, maybe just a little too busy to answer questions about the drink menu...but the drinks themselves were really good. The hostess was pretty rude - as if it were too much bother to show us to our table once it was ready, so whatever. Our server was super frazzled and couldn't tell us much about the menu, so we made some choices and hoped for the best. One of the main dishes was the jumbo prawns - a HUGE mistake. They are battered and fried which sounded good...except they still had the hard shells intact under all the batter - and we figured that out *after* we started to eat them. Yuck. Not nice to have to spit out shells at the table! When I asked the manager if they were supposed to be eaten that way, he really didn't have an answer. The other dish was the half chicken and it ended up being really good...except that came a half hour after we had to ask the manager if it was ever going to be brought out, since our server forgot all about it and he hadn't even come by that whole time to check on us. All in all, the entire visit wasn't worth the time spent. Oh - and a lovely spider crawled out from somewhere behind our booth and across my face into my hair while we were still sitting at the table. That was at the end of the meal, so we just called it a night and wrapped it up as fast as we could. We won't be going back. Like, ever.","4893":"My favourite restaurant of 2021!!!  I wish I could go back weekly - this restaurant hits it out of the ballpark on all aspects for me, bringing joy all around.\n\nEnvironment - impeccably designed and decorated.  So beautiful inside and the patio makes COVID safe dining feel safe and upscale!  Plenty of heaters and fire pits to keep you warm and create a warm atmosphere amidst the beautiful greenery and flowers.\n\nService - friendly, professional service that pays careful attention - you know the small things like the wait staff waiting for everyone to arrive or sit back down before taking orders, placing the food down, folding napkins when you've stepped away, making sure orders are sufficient, coursed properly, etc.  I know this sounds like table stakes but it's a rarity these days with restaurants struggling to keep staff so I was really impressed by the high quality service and desire by the restaurant to main high standards.\n\nFood - AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.  It is family style here.  We ordered a range of small and large dishes - every single one was memorable, multi layered flavors, surprise bursts of flavor!  My favorite was the trout dish along with the creative drinks!\n\nWorth planning ahead to get a confirmed seat but we were able to get a table mid week without a res by arriving at opening (where a line had already started!).\n\nPlenty of street and public lot parking nearby.  Tons of cute stores to browse as well. \n\nCan't wait to come back - really loved the food, drinks and beautiful environment.","4894":"Dinner for 4, first time here. We enjoyed a sampling of many of the Lark's menu items through the prix fixe menu. Great service from Louie and the rest of the Lark's staff, festive atmosphere, and the very positive party vibe. This is a nice place for a new year's eve dinner. The family style of service (service is organized to large plates in the center of the table where possible) was interesting and it worked quite well.\n\nWe dropped the fifth star because the prix fixe menu was our only option, and we didn't understand this at the time the reservation was made. We prefer a full menu array of choices, and if a prix fix menu is offered, then fine, we might choose that. Fortunately, the wine selections were not limited to the prix fixe  menu, because we very much appreciated the French Rhone Valley-style wines from California.\n\nHere is our menu (choose 1 from each category): New Year's Eve at The Lark 2015 - 2016\n\nSnacks\n\nThe Lark Popcorn\nRed Wine Salt, Duck Fat, Thyme, Parsley, Rosemary, Black Pepper, Lemon Zest\n\nCrude\n\nChoice of\nOysters on the Half Shell\nBlood Orange Granita, Pink Peppercorn, Red Shiso\nor\nCitrus Cured Ocean Trout\nHouse-Made Sambal Aioli, Candied Peanuts, Kaffir Lime, Kumquat, Smoked Trout Roe\n\nFarm\n\nChoice of\nWarm Caramelized Pears & Quince\nFrench Brie, Pistachio, Radicchio, Tangerine, Roasted Espresso Bean\nor\nGrilled Globe Artichoke\nBlack Truffle Beurre Blanc, Soft Poached Egg, Texas Toast, Fine Herbs\n\nOcean\n\nChoice of\nSanta Barbara Sea Urchin Pappardelle\nCrispy Smoked Pork Belly, Preserved Blood Orange,\nCalabrian Chile, Black Pepper Brioche, Tarragon\nor\nChorizo Crusted Diver Scallops\nSmoked Beets, Blood Orange, Red Mustard Greens, Chive Butter, Horseradish\n\nRanch\n\nChoice of\nSouthern Duck Confit\nFoie Gras & Jalapeno Cornbread, Bacon Braised Black-Eyed Peas,\nRosemary Honey, Lark Hot Sauce\nor\n72 Hour Marinated & Grilled Prime Flat Iron\nSweet Potato Gratin, Roasted King Trumpet Mushrooms,\nRainbow Chard, Bone Marrow Emulsion\n\nNew Year's Eve Dessert\n\nChoice of\nRoasted Banana Poundcake\nKey Lime Curd, Brown Sugar Ice Cream, Banana Chip, Chai Tea Caramel\nor\nDark Chocolate Bavarois\nMaple Custard, Pecan Streusel, Buttermilk Ice Cream, Huckleberry Jam\n\nincludes a complimentary champagne toast.\n\nEnjoy!","4895":"Pretty good overall. The buttermilk chicken was good. At first I didn't like it because of the green aioli sauce, but after that I took less with the next piece and the chicken was so moist and rich in taste. Sat indoors at a booth and wish we had a better table. I'd love to come back in the future.","4896":"We ordered 6 oysters one of them didn't taste right but they took care of it right away. The beet salad,  carrot, prawn, and pamegranet beef was out of this world. Highly recommended.","4897":"We made reservation prior to our trip and we are so glad we did. We got seated outside and it was packed but socially distanced. The waiters were all wearing face masks and the menu had to be viewed online. Their locktail were great to start with. The food came out pretty fast! We also had the grilled octapus but forgot to take a photo. My favorite dish was the grilled octopus and the wedge salad! I with the trout was white meat and not salmon looking meat! Haha. But they insisted it was trout! \n\nGreat for a date, family, friends dinner!","4898":"Horrible service!  Wine\/Drinks took for ever.  Missed our Brussels sprout small plate order.  Not on the ball!  And the look from the server behind the mask, he was smirking.  Well tip will be appropriate.","4899":"SOSOSO delicious. perfect date night. the server was really knowledgeable about allergies so I felt safe eating here. 100% vibes","4900":"I've been wanting to check out The Lark for a while and finally had a chance to with a great group of friends! We did a walk in on Sunday, Halloween night, and luckily even though there were no private tables available, we were given the option to sit at the large communal table which was perfect. The weather was perfect and it felt like we were eating both indoors and outdoors simultaneously. \n\nWe ordered all of our waiter's recommendations- the crispy Brussels sprouts, fried halloumi with squash and pomegranate, fried chicken and the branzino. We also ordered the prawns and a couple of drinks. Everything was delicious and the service was incredibly attentive and friendly.\n\nThey also serve a house popcorn which was easily the best popcorn I've ever had. I already found a recipe online on how I can recreate it. My favorite dish of the night was the branzino - phenomenal. A must try. The fried chicken was a generous portion but I wouldn't order it again. I'd order everything else again though! And I'll definitely be back for that popcorn. They have a great dessert menu as well but unfortunately all of us were too full to try anything. The final bill wasn't also terribly expensive considering how much food was served. It came out to about $50 per person for appetizer\/entrees\/drinks.\n\nSB usually lacks in their food quality but The Lark is a gem. My new favorite. I'll be back to try more things off the menu as well as bring my parents and more friends!","4901":"The food was great, but they had originally sat us in the very front table. No joke we had so many people walk by us that working at the lark but also many people visiting the restaurant. Some wearing mask and some not. It honestly was a table that should not be located there. Ruined our experience until they moved us to the back, which was much better. I hope the owner decides to just remove that table during the pandemic.","4902":"Amazing ambiance + American food made for a great dinner. It had a rustic feel with a gorgeous back patio with vegetables, fish, and seafood. The cocktails were great too!\n\nWhat I got:\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts - great brussel sprouts with dates added which was a perfect add 4.5\/5\nTuna Crudo - this dish honestly lacked flavor & substance for me 2\/5\nBaba Ganoush - charred eggplant spread - very yummy but not best ever had 4\/5\nButtermilk Fried Chicken - GET THIS! One of the best fried chickens ever - comes with a lot, chicken boneless and cooked perfectly in amazing sauce","4903":"We ate at The Lark before CoVid and enjoyed the outdoor ambiance and the creative and tasty vegetarian plates.  However, we just ordered the same dishes over a year later as take out due to CoVid.  Sadly, the Brussels Sprouts, Carrots, and Salad were highly over seasoned and over sauced.  The three dishes had become soggy by the time we were home.  I give them credit for trying to make interesting and new vegetarian dishes but I think they're trying too hard and would do better by not drowning them.  Next time I'll order chicken!","4904":"We were greeted with a hand written post card wishing us a Happy Anniversary! Very nice touch! In addition to that, our server gave us a couple glasses of champagne! Again, very nice touch! The way the food is presented is perfect for us- you choose a variety of small dishes that you share. You actually DINE! We chose to have one dish at a time then when we were ready another dish came! I love a restaurant that doesn't rush you. The food was presented so beautifully and so fresh and delicious!!! Gourmet at it's finest!","4905":"They tell you to order a lot and we ended up ordering too much. It was only an issue because the food was so good and we couldn't fit any more food in our stomachs. Hard to get a reservation so plan in advance. I will be going back the second I get the chance. \n\nRemember that they are all supposed to be sharing plates! I recommend getting one plate for every person you are dining with, then share everything.","4906":"This place was sooo good! Went for my 40th birthday with my mom and my sister on a girls trip. We shared the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Southern Fried Chicken, and the Hand Cut Tagliatelle Pasta, I would highly recommend all three...absolutely delicious! They say they are family style portions and to share, the portions aren't huge, but still sharable if you get a few plates for table. COVID seating was patio only, but the ambiance on the patio was perfect!","4907":"The lark is as advertised.  A great spot for a casual evening on a beautiful patio eating exceptional food.  The Paloma's were well received in our party and I was impressed with the inventiveness of the whiskey cocktails including the scotch based  cocktail.  All of the dishes were well executed.  Real food.  Generous portions. Every one seems to do Brussel sprouts these days, but they were as good as we have had anywhere.  The tagliatelle was also delicious.  The meat dishes were also strong - we shared the chicken, pork, and steak.  Really good service.  We had a really nice evening.","4908":"I highly recommend the Lark SB  for dinner, yes Santa Barbara has lots of great places to offer, but this particular restaurant is simply a must! \nThey have amazing menu concept not so typical family style, where you can try a lot of different dishes, yet won't feel overwhelmed! Organic local produce, make to perfection, my personal favorites are the hanger steak, raw oysters and crispy Brussels sprouts, just impressive! \nThe wine list is exceptional, they offer lots of wines French or local, full bar along with numerous cocktails.\nNot to mention, excellent services!! Friendly staff and beautiful indoor outdoor space! \nOne of the best restaurants in California hands down! \nCheers","4909":"This place is absolutely incredible, a truly excellent, sexy, and high class restaurant for dinner in Santa Barbara.  Had to come here after hearing raves from a friend.\n\nIf you plan to go, and get a table, you 100 percent need a reservation.  Otherwise the wait will probably be an hour or two for dinner.\n\nThey do however have the \"community table\" for walk in's, which our group of 4 worked fie for, and we sat on the corner edge so we could face each other and talk.\n\nAlso, you can join your neighors convo sometimes. Our first neighbor was a crazy grumpy and awful woman and her husband. Bad vibes. Then replaced with 2 very sweet women from Agoura Hills. Much better!\n\nOur server was  very nice as well.  Professional, Educated on the menu, Knowledgable, and able  too handle the volume of the table. The place is always packed so expect to chat a bunch in between courses.\n\nThe food is outrageously amazIng. We tried everything.\n\n1) The Beet Salad- Fresh, Delicious, Healthy\n2) The Chicken Liver Pate- Refreshing, Flavorful\n3) Beef Tartar with Chickpeas- Very Good\n4) Lamb Ribs- Incredible (BEST DISH)\n5) Paparradelle Pasta- Good, Sauce was a little weak.\n\nDessert was a delicious Bread Pudding (Off the Menu Apparently) and we also enjoyed Balvenie 12 Whiskey which is one of my favorites, and they have Blantons too!!\n\n5 stars. Incredible. One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara.","4910":"Wonderful!!! \n\nEverything from check-in to closing out was great! My husband and I came for dinner. We did have an earlier reservation before the dinner rush so our service was top notch. Free popcorn to start (could have had more of that though) Their cocktails are wonderful. I had a Tito's martini and husband had the Paloma. Both were excellent. We got the charcuterie board and the portions of cheese were just the right amount. I have had charcuterie boards where the cheese sample is so small that it  is barely one bite for two people. We split the pasta, the beef, and the octopus. I have zero complaints with the dishes and they all came out great. Definitely come here if you're visiting Santa Barbara","4911":"What a wonderful place to have dinner. The fiancee made reservations for one of my birthday dinners here.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. Large bar area and indoor and outdoor seating. We were led to a nice booth and my back was facing the outside waiting area. This is great for people watching and on a nice summer day. There was a birthday card waiting on the table. SWEET!!!\n\nThe server was very nice and explained the concept. You order tapas style and you order a tapa per section in the menu. We thought the food wasn't going to be filling, but it actually was. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n-Gnocchi with Crab\n-Crispy Smoked Pork Belly ($16)\n-Marinated & Grilled Hanger Steak ($19)\n-Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme ($7)\n\nOur dinner came out to be about $150 more or less. I love the ambiance, decor, food and service. Such a great place to have a romantic meal, special occasion or bring a group of friends.\n\nMake reservations!","4912":"Double Whammy, Graduation weekend at UCSB and so happens to be on Father's Day. I had to set forth to try a new trendy place and The Lark did not disappoint. I had made reservation a couple months earlier through Yelp (Resy) for Sunday, 7:45 p.m. party of 4. When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away, we opted to sit in the patio which was very nice.\n\nOur server (Grant?) introduced herself, gave us a rundown of how The Lark serves, we ordered cocktails while looking over the menu and munching on the Popcorn goodie. Basically Family Shared Plates, so we ordered for 4 people 5 dishes, which was what was recommended. Chicken Skin Cracklins, Japanese Hamachi Crudo, Crispy Duck Leg Confit, Grilled Australian Wagyu Bavette, Pork Ribs. All the food came out hot with a nice presentation.\n\nThe Hamachi, Duck Leg Confit, Wagyu Bavette,  and the Pork Ribs (perfect for Father's Day) all EXCELLENT! the Chicken Skins were least my favorite, over seasoned.\n\nAtmosphere: trendy (keeping up with The Funk Zone area, Service: excellent, Food: excellent","4913":"This place is so  popular as you can see from the reviews and you need a reservation every time you go. But I can definitely say all their food is made with 100% love and that is why everything is Fuego","4914":"All I have to say is this; the long drive is worth the pain. A friend of mine recommended me this restaurant few months ago and I finally decided to give it a try. First of all, I hesitated to come because of the distance but after reading all the reviews my stomach screamed from far away GO, YOU HAVE TO GO and there I was driving for 2 hrs and 35 minutes to get here. Was it worthy?? Hell yeah!!! The food was delicious. The meat was melting in my mouth; super tender and flavorful. The portions big enough and the prices were not that bad either. I was impressed for their customer service. The staff was super friendly and our waiter exceeded all my expectations of great customer service. I honestly didn't order from the menu. I asked the waiter to bring us the favorite and most popular dishes in the menu and boooooy, we didn't get disappointed me. Everything was perfectly cooked. Beautiful presentation. And the variety of the menu was awesome. If you're vegan, you'll enjoy it too. They have everything for everyone. How cool is that?? I didn't regret spending Christmas eve dining in this restaurant. Best decision ever. The only issue?   we had problems getting a reservation. We tried online, all booked, we tried on the phone, no answer.......we just showed up one hour after opening time and we were lucky to got seated right away. Besides that; Awesome experience!!","4915":"This place is amaze balls!  David, David, David is one of my favorite waiters ever.  He did a wonderful job of explaining the menu and ensuring that we did not over order as we easily could have.  He made recommendations with ease and was sincere about what combinations and flavors would yield the best meal.  He checked in and out appropriately and was had a pleasant personality all the way around.  \nWe started with the crispy brussels sprouts along with a bottle of the Tyler.  I really enjoyed the Tyler as it was light and crisp for the occasion.  We ordered the goat confit pasta, pork belly, hamachi crudo, steelhead trout, and the chicken.  The chef decides what order all of the entr\u00e9es come out in and the flow is at a great pace. \nDessert consisted of the goat cheese cheesecake and the honey cremeux.  Seriously wow the chicken is huge and incredibly tender and a must. I think we only did half of the size and still have leftovers. Overall my favorite was the goat confit and the pork belly followed by the hamachi.  The honey cremeux was actually an addition on the house from David and it was so much better than the dessert we had actually ordered.  Great atmosphere for either a great meal in the restaurant or just to hang out at the bar. It does look like there is a community table in the middle so be sure to make reservations.  Great firepits outside with great lighting for a picture.  The hostess is also very attentive and was quick to offer which is always nice.  A definite repeat!","4916":"Matt B. and I went back to The Lark for a date night last month during a weekend trip to Santa Barbara. It was as good as we remembered, if not even better. We had a 7:30 reservation this time, at an indoor table, and enjoyed the warm, bustling atmosphere. We ended up talking to an older couple from Los Angeles for like half of our meal, and this seemed totally normal in this friendly place. Service was welcoming and attentive, and we had a stellar dinner.\n\nWe had a couple rounds of cocktails, and these were all great, tasty and thoughtfully crafted. JP's Paloma was a nice, refreshing drink of citrus-infused tequila, jalape\u00f1o, house grapefruit soda, and kaffir lime leaf; La Llorona a lovely mix of Vida mezcal, pear eau-de-vie, lemon, and sage. On the whiskey side, we enjoyed the 100\u00b0 Sazerac, a sazerac variation made with Rittenhouse rye, Laird's apple brandy, cinnamon, St. George absinthe, and bitters; The Penicillin was also on point, blended scotch with ginger, honey, lemon, and an Islay float.\n\nThe food was delicious, and we ate a good deal of it, gorging ourselves thanks to my greedy ordering. First, there was The Lark's irresistible complimentary house popcorn, which I remembered from our first visit. Then we shared some raw seafood starters. The West Coast oysters on the half shell were fresh and refreshing, a half dozen served over a bed of ice with granny smith apple granita, Goodland Farms caviar lime, and red shiso. The Japanese hamachi crudo was a wonderful dish, maybe my favorite of the night, the meaty, supple yellowtail presented with Mud Creek Ranch grapefruit, grilled hearts of palm, Persian cucumber, sweet habanero, and celery. So many great flavors and textures on this plate. Definitely a must order.\n\nFor our main course, we had caramelized diver scallops, slow roasted Niman Ranch ribs, and a side of crispy brussels sprouts. The scallops were plump and silky with a nice sear to them, and they came with a warm, hearty, savory medley of roasted cauliflower, sugar snap peas, pomegranate and lime gastrique, Fresno chile \"sambal,\" and mint. The ribs were tender and flavorful, with a Southern sweet tea glaze, served with fingerling potato salad, Anaheim chiles, Easter egg radish, chives, and \"Texas Tornado\" hot sauce. The Lark really knows how to bring the A-game with its vegetable accompaniments. The brussels sprouts, of course, were particularly noteworthy, roasted tender and blasted with flavor, mixed up with medjool dates, garum, sesame, and lime.\n\nWe were pretty full by dessert, but could not resist some milk and cookies. These were insane: soft, warm Mexican chocolate cookies with cinnamon and ancho chile, served with a milky toasted almond horchata.\n\nWe loved The Lark on our first visit, but I'd forgotten a lot of the specifics, and was impressed all over again the second time around. We'll definitely be back on future trips to Santa Barbara. I'm hoping we make it back before another four years go by.","4917":"I had an AWFUL experience dealing with management here. \nI'm getting married in Santa Barbara in March, a lot of my guests are out of towners. I chose the lark to host a welcome drink the night before my wedding, thinking we could get a table for around 25 people, order food and drinks. \nI tried for an entire month to book this reservation. I got tossed around to 4 different people, 2 of which were managers. \nAlejandro in particular was extremely rude and the last person I dealt with. I was told there were bookings fees, it had to be in the wine room, then I was told I could avoid fees by booking earlier, then I was told otherwise. \nI was literally told 3 different sets of rules and fees. It was very confusing and upsetting. I explained I wanted it to be casual, we would order food and drinks. \nThere was only 1 person who had any amount of professionalism, everyone else was rude and un-helpful. \nI would not recommend having any sort of get together here. They are interested in your business.","4918":"Excellent food. Your going to pay for it but that's expected at a nice restaurant like this. I enjoy the meal style and was stuff by the end of the night","4919":"Great outdoor seating, wonderful service and good food. Our server was Dorian who was great, and very knowledgeable about wine-- and just generally one of the best experiences I've had dining in Santa Barbara. Menu has a modest, but effective selection. While they don't have vegan specific items on the menu, they will make you a vegan plate on request. They also do have a \"from the garden\" section which l is mostly vegetarian. Nice wine list selection which includes some wines, good cocktail options ... and overall A+ experience. Highly highly recommended if you are visiting Santa Barbara, or just a go-to spot if you are a local.","4920":"I kept reading about The Lark from ads, articles, and directories. One even recommended this place as a \"fancy dinner date place\".\n\nSuggestion #1: Make a reservation. Otherwise, it'll be like lottery or gambling.\n\nSuggestion #2: Come early. So you get a choice on where to sit. Also so it won't be so crowded.\n\nI gotta admit, I over ordered. It was our last night in SB and I wasn't sure when I'll be seeing The Lark again.\n\nFig and Goat Cheese Tartine - First thing that came out. My hunger was satisfied after this. Yeah. If I just had this for dinner, I would have been full and I would have been satisfied and not just because it was hearty, but also because it was so darn yummy. Highly recommend.\n\nCheese Board - Great selection of cheeses, crisps and sweets. Highly recommend.  Chosen to go along with each other well.\n\nTomatoes and Cucumber - what a great summer dish. The tomatoes were really ripe and each kind tasted differently.\n\nDill Popcorn - came as a treat. Very yummy. If they sold this on a to-go counter, I would totally buy this. Better eat them while they're freshly popped and warm from the pan though.\n\nSparkling Water - pretty darned pricey. Make sure you ask what kind they have first if you don't want to be surprised.\n\nFried Chicken - I could count in one hand the truly awesome fried chickens I've had. This just got added.\n\nPrawns - oh so good. You must order!\n\nChocolate Budino - so good! If you still have space, you must order. Or better yet, make sure you don't order too much and order some desserts.\n\nTahini Ice Cream - very good.","4921":"This was an amazing experience. Outstanding food, excellent service, presentation.  Really enjoyed our dinner. We shared all the dishes and all agreed that flavors were amazing. Those beef cheeks were probably the best I have ever tried. \nThey were a bit late to seat us for our 8:15 pm reservations but they made up for it with comp drinks which shows how much they care about customer service.","4922":"Working in the Funk Zone, I have been to The Lark at least a dozen times.\n\nNote, they do switch up their menu a little bit every month, and yet there are some constants, one being their Secret Burger which you won't find on the menu and supposedly can only be ordered at the bar or their communal table, however I have heard tell of some servers who bend the rules and will serve it at a private table. \nYou can taste the high quality of the beef and they make sure to cook it perfectly to temp. The Secret Sauce they apply to the toasted brioche bun is delish and I always ask for a side of it to dip the fries in. I'm not usually a fan of french fries, but I do adore them here.\n\nExecutive Chef Jason Paluska is definitely on top of the Upscale Farm to Table movement and fits in perfectly at The Lark.\n\nOther dishes I've tried...\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts-quite good for not being homemade.\nLittle Gems Wedge-the only \"wedge\" style salad I have ever liked. The key is the baby hearts of romaine they use instead of iceberg. \nOctopus dish(which they change up frequently)-there's always too much of whatever fruit they feature to accompany.\nMarinated and Grilled Hanger Steak-yes.\n\nThis review is based solely on my experiences sitting at the bar and communal table. The bartenders are great and always friendly.","4923":"Great staff.  Friendly service that care about the customer experience.  Food and presentation awesome.  Go with friends for food and conversation.  Great place for adult time.  Trendy ambiance and wonderful experience.","4924":"Exceptional dining experience - food, ambiance, service - top notch on all fronts!\n\nMade a last minute reservation for a Saturday night at 10PM. Ended up receiving a text that a table was available for 9:30pm on their patio and took it.\n\nAfter hearing all the hype around this restaurant, we wanted to try a few plates from each section. Ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, mushroom tartine, Buttermilk fried chicken, mussels, and prawns. Also ordered a cocktail (bees bliss) and glass of wine with dinner.\n\nLoved everything I tried! I'm surprised the Lark doesn't have a Michelin star, the quality and experience is so exceptional. Definitely worth planning around if you can get a reservation! A place worth celebrating.\n\nAlso, shout out to our fantastic server, Breanna, for taking such good care of us! We appreciated your patience and on point recommendations :)","4925":"What a great time. My sister and I had an amazing experience here while on vacation. The food, the service, even the ambience was on point- particularly challenging given the post-covid world we're in right now. \nThe highlight of our visit was our server Mitch. He was so knowledgable about the menu, so enthusiastic about our choices, and overall a pleasant and funny dude. He even took an item off our check that was ordered and dropped off to us in error but was nonetheless delicious. All the other staff were friendly and engaging as well. What a great time. Will def visit again.","4926":"My family and I were looking for a pizza place and we came to the Lucky Penny. The pizza here is so good! We got the pepperoni and Today's Farmers Market. I preferred the latter for the heavy amounts of fresh basil they added, plus it's an excellent vegetarian option. The rosemary potato chips are freshly made and well seasoned. The ambiance is nice and cozy; there's a large outdoor seating area with heating lamps. I took off a star because we had to pay for still water, which seems like it's something that should be provided in a large jar or whatnot. I highly recommend this place for the food quality and taste.","4927":"I suppose the third time is a charm! I have been here not one, not two, but three times and I'm finally giving it the 5-star review it deserves. The Lark embraces all things Santa Barbara with a beach town vibe, mock food truck (with a skeleton driver), string lights, gas lamps, plenty of foliage, and antique decor touches. While the majority of seating is outside on their patios shared with The Lucky Penny (due to Covid), there are several tables\/booths inside which require a reservation. The bar unfortunately does not have stools, however, there is a communal social distanced seating option.\n\nWe were welcomed by the hostess and received a bowl of their homemade flavor-alternating popcorn (sweet lemon poppy). We were all ravenous and fighting over each and every kernel! The appetizers and salads came out quickly, even though there was a rush of people who arrived around 6 pm. I simply would come here JUST for small plates or \"happy hour\". If it is your first time here, don't miss out on their most popular items: Crispy Brussel Sprouts or The Garden Of Little Gems 'Wedge' Salad.\n\nWe wanted to try some new items this time around which could be shared communally (highly recommended approach!). Their salads are super fresh and tossed with local vegetables. We enjoyed the Ancient Grain Salad and Heirloom Tomato & Persian Cucumbers. Everything from the celery to the cucumbers was full of flavor! We continued with the Chilled Artichoke & Crab Dip and Steelhead Trout. Both were spectacular whether it was the homemade potato chips with dip piled on top, or the meaty, salmon-like trout with its tasty maitake mushrooms. We wrapped up with the Grilled Hanger Steak including blistered shishitos, oven-dried tomatoes, green chermoula, and bone marrow butter. EVERY single one of the dishes was sure to please.\n\nAll of our food items paired well with our creative mixologist cocktails and local bottle of Brave & Maiden Cabernet Sauvignon. If you're a wino, don't pass up their spectacular wine list that is overwhelmingly Californian wines. The manager Chris was extremely welcoming and checked on our table during our meal. He is super knowledgeable about wine pairings and helped us find the right bottle to choose for the table.\nWe spoiled ourselves with dessert which usually consists of a panna cotta, tres leches, or ice cream. I can tell why they have so few options since I was not previously a fan of either of the first two until I tried them out here!\n\nIf you're looking for a place to celebrate a special occassion or enjoy shared small plates, The Lake is a wonderful choice. You may get lucky enough to see a celebrity...","4928":"\"The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one big thing -- desire.\" \n\u2015 Willa Cather, The Song of the Lark\n\nThe area around the Santa Barbara train station has grown exponentially over the last few years.  Now there are a plethora of restaurants, wineries, shops whereas before there was just the original Lilly's Tacos (Still the best taco experience I've ever had).  I discovered both the Spanish restaurant and The Lark last year and decided to try The Lark once again before another SB Bowl concert. While last year I would have given it 5 stars, this year the experience was not quite that magnificent so I will give it 4 stars.  \n\nA plus of course is free valet parking.  Given lack of parking in area, that starts the meal off right.  The restaurant includes both indoor and outdoor seating, both times we sat outside. Reservations available through Open Table. \n\nWe were seated on recent visit next to Lucky Penny's patio and that creates a weirdness of hearing two outdoor music playlists. These two places really should coordinate.  It definitely detracts from the experience.  \n\nService was solid but not overly friendly.  And some gaps by not offering us the bread course, disappearing for long stretches.  But those are minor irritants.  \n\nAs for the food, not as wonderful as last year.  The cheese board was not as impressive, crackers not as good as the bread.  Strawberry jam was best part.  \n\nThe salad my dining companion ordered this year was just okay however the charred octopus was out of this world good. The Santa Barbara Gruner Veltliner we started with was lovely, the Santa Ynez Cabernet was also nice but lacking a bit body. They also gave us a taste of the Lo-Fi Gamay but it was too unsubstantial to consider ordering.  \nSo five star visit last year, 3.5 stars this year.  I will call it a 4 star.  \n\nRecommended, but pricey especially with wine.  I think there is better value elsewhere and the competing music ambiance lowers value of outside seating.","4929":"My husband and I were in Santa Barbara celebrating our wedding and went to the Lark for a romantic dinner. We arrived early and were able to get a seat at the bar. The communication between bartender and hostess was amazing. We sat outside where we were met with amazing service from our server Max. He was spot on with the recommendations and even brought us our complementary celebratory drinks (we had gotten married the previous day). The food was so good the we ended up taking the cookbook home with us!! Needless to say if it was not for Max's great service and recommendations we would have missed out on one of the best meals I've ever had! (we had the brussel sprouts, fried chicken and steak). Thank you Max and the rest of the Lark team for such an amazing experience!","4930":"Very disappointed\nWe were really looking forward to dining at The Lark, but we were sorely disappointed. The ambiance was good hence the 2 stars but the food did not live up to the hype and was definitely not worth the money. The mussels were bland and the chef served us a couple of mussels that did not open which is not acceptable in a restaurant as it could be a health hazard. The crispy pork belly was anything but crispy. Of the 5 pieces that were served, 1 piece was pure fat, no meat at all, completely not rendered and not edible. We told our waiter about the closed mussels and the inedible pure fat pork belly and he did not seem at all concerned. \nFor a restaurant of this caliber, every single dish that comes out of the kitchen should be checked and double checked by the Chef and\/or the Sous Chef. \nI would not recommend nor would I go back to this restaurant.","4931":"My girlfriend and I had heard the hype on The Lark and it lived up to all expectations. We showed up on Saturday night without reservations but were able to grab a couple seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly if a bit scattered due to the large crowds packing the hip restaurant.\n\nWe split the beets and burrata salad, shishito peppers, hangar steak, all completely excellent. We also had a few pints of craft beers, of which the restaurant has a terrifically curated selection.\n\nWe were just looking for a bite after an unplanned and unsuccessful beach camping trip where all of the sites along  the coast were booked up, so we didn't do the full on multicourse experience, but everything was so great that I want to come back next time I'm in town.\n\nThe one sorta complaint is that the crowd is just so... well, Santa Barbara. Rich old guys trying to pass off as hip on dates with botoxed models were the main demographic of the evening.  But hey, it's good people watching, right?","4932":"The food was excellent and the staff was great as well. The kale salad with the coffee dressing was a unique and delicious dish. The scallop dish was a solid choice and the pork belly was decadent.","4933":"The brussel sprouts were very tasty as well as the popcorn. However there was a 15 minute delay after my boyfriend got his dish and when I got mine. Our main dishes were terrible we got two fish dishes and left after paying to go get burgers. Service was also bad, rarely checked up on us.","4934":"I can't wait to go back to this place! First, the outdoor ambiance was beautiful. We got sat on their patio next to the fireplace so it kept us cozy on a cold night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which might be hands down my favorite items on the menu. The cauliflower was great, but nothing compared to the Brussels. The prawns were amazing, cooked perfectly and the creamy sauce at the bottom went perfect with them. And the fried chicken was so juicy and tender. Looking forward to going back!","4935":"Great surroundings but foods are not that good as expected. Maybe cuz waiting a week to reserve and having high expectation on it makes me a little bit disappointed. Overall it's good. The sauce in oysters I really like--the apple flavor and lemon. Personally, Ribs, Crispy Brussels, Tomato salad with plums and Caramelized scallops are too salty that made me trunk almost three cups of tea. Duck liver with toasted bread is pretty good~","4936":"The Lark is not what it justo be. This was the best restaurant in Santa Barbara... Had to send the chicken back twice, not cooked enough all the way through\nWill keep trying because we justo love it","4937":"Briana was incredible. Super knowledgeable and immediately accommodating with dietary restrictions. She knows the menu. On top of that, she was incredibly sweet. Will come back and hope she's my server","4938":"In the midst of COVID and restaurants slowly reopening, I appreciate that this place does have outdoor dining. Entrance is on Anacapa St, not Helena St.\nThey provided complimentary popcorn with lemon poppyseed seasoning that was absolutely delicious! Never new popcorn could taste this good.\n\nEverything is meant to be shared and our waiter recommended about 3 dishes for 2 people.\n\nHandmade Orecchiette Pasta: Nice fresh flavors from the vegetables and the pecorino cheese added some depth. For the price, would have appreciated some protein and would be a dish I skip if I come back.\nSmoked crab dip: nice smoky flavors of the crab meat. Solid appetizer \nCrispy duck leg confit: duck was cooked perfect; the meat was soft and the skin was crispy. The corn polenta was also fantastic, but slightly on the sweeter side.\n\nOverall, a very solid restaurant that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.","4939":"This place is obviously on the list of where to eat on a Friday night, we had reservations and were immediately seated at our cute booth. Our sweet waitress brought us the popcorn and I seriously could have just snacked on that all evening, yum! We ordered the cornbread and brussels","4940":"I like the lark when Santa Barbra. Easy to get in and out of menu is Seasonal and changes.","4941":"My husband and I were pretty disappointed with our experience at the Lark. We had high expectations due to the reviews that just weren't met... \n\nWe first sat at the high top communal table while we waited for outdoor seating to free. They started us off with some complimentary chili fennel sweet popcorn, which I loved and couldn't get enough of! Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Got some cocktails (not great) and ordered a cheese board. The cheeses were not that flavorful, but the grilled bread and jam it was served with were great! I'd say it's not really a good sign if the cheese on a cheese board is not the highlight.  \n\nThen we got seated at our table. The outdoor area is cute, but not as nice as I expected from the photos. We ordered the lamb ribs and wagyu beef. The lamb ribs were cold, fatty, and gamey - a definite no-go! And the wagyu beef was just ok - kinda chewy, sauce too sweet, and paired with tough eggplant. Meh.\n\nTo top it all off, our waitress at our dinner table just didn't have a great attitude. Unfortunately, I wish we had spent one of our limited nights in Santa Barbara enjoying a better dinner somewhere else! Maybe even the neighboring pizza place!","4942":"The Funk Zone is where it's at!  We were on our way to The Lark for dinner when we happened to see our good friends from L.A. in the window of the guitar shop nearby.  What are the odds?  We chatted for a while and found out that they just had dinner at The Lark.  They recommended a couple of dishes and we were on our way to dinner.  My recommendation is to make reservations.  We didn't plan ahead.  We were told by the hostess that the communal table is up for grabs whenever spots open up.  My husband heads for the bar and I am now in shark mode.  Scanning the table looking for people that are finishing up.  This part was not my favorite.  I was successful in grabbing a couple of chairs without a long wait. \n\nMy husband returns from the bar with The Mule for me and he had a Woodford Whiskey neat.  We were immediately greeted by our waiter and served popcorn.  He gave us the rundown of the menu and this is what he had:\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts-Delicious!\nAutumn Beets & Butternut Squash- Loved the beets but the apple and caramel flavors were confusing to me as it tasted more like a dessert.\nSmoked Pork Belly with roasted Blackberry, almond brittle, pickled summer peppers and house made Chicharron-To die for!  The picture did not come out well but it was great.\nStrozzapreti Pasta & Whole Confit Goat with blackened figs, caramelized mushroom, midnight moon?, Juniper berry and chickweed- Really good but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and could not finish.\nThe service was fantastic from start to finish and we can't wait to come back!","4943":"A friend and I were having a girls' weekend away and she reserved a spot here for dinner. Having never heard of it, I went with a completely open mind and palate.\n\nWe were seated outside - per our request - and had a great table with even better service. We were given complimentary popcorn which was described as \"very yummy\" by the server. He was adorable!\n\nWe ordered the beet salad, brown butter cornbread and crispy duck confit. Every single dish was spectacular. The beet salad was super fresh and had such a good balance of acid and sweetness. The cornbread was HEAVENLY. I wish I had a block of it in front of me with that aleppo butter.\n\nThe star was the crispy duck confit. Rich, crispy, smoky, savory.... One of the best duck dishes I've had.\n\nAtmosphere was so lovely, I had such a fun time with my friend. I will definitely bring others back here and will make this a date night restaurant for SURE.","4944":"WOW. The menu was insane and I love that its a seasonal menu. Definitely a spot we will come to when were up in SB! Everything starting from appetizers to desert was unique and delicious!","4945":"So glad that we came to the Lark. The food was amazing, but the service was absolutely stellar. Our servers name was John, he was totally professional without being overbearing. He was always there to attend to our needs, I really can't say enough about him and The Lark. It is now one of my favorite places in Santa Barbara. We will be back!!","4946":"We love the Lark. Menu, food, service, ambiance - all of it stands out and deserves more than 5 stars.","4947":"What do you get when you mix gentrification, well-invested restaurant groups, and a decent intsagram marketing person? You guessed it! The Lark is overpriced menus and mediocre food. \n\nAfter visiting all 7 of ACME hospitality restaurants in the  funk zone I disappointedly report that not one of them impressed me enough to leave a review until now. The unfortunate truth is that what impresses me about The Lark (and 2\/6 of their other establishments) is not the food, in fact, its the price tag.  The Lark is for me is the textbook definition of the term, \"So over-rated\". \n\nThe Lark serves up \"family\" style portions that only a few people in a family\/group would actually enjoy, which undoubtedly encourages you to order more plates in order to accommodate everyone at one table. Fan-favorites are some of the same things you could order at ANY other restaurant and pretty hard to mess up including; the Wedge Salad, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Ribeye Steak. None of these dishes taste any as good as they do in LA or New York but they certainly match the prices? \n\nWHY? a quick stroll down their the reviews reveals the answer and it's quite easy to spot when you are there. The Lark's favorite diner is the tourist couple who is in town for the weekend from elsewhere and celebrating their \"Anniversary, birthday, graduation etc\". The ambiance caters to groups and there is a celebratory vibe considering the shared plate concept, full bar, and extensive wine list. The lark gets reccomended by every hotel in the area for guests who expect to overpay while traveling. \n\nGrowing up in Santa Barbara and having spent the last 5 years in LA, this \"LA vibe\" restaurant is the LAST thing I want to experience while in my sleepy, beachy home town. Despite my personal opinion, I HAVE recommended the Lark to a few of my high profile clients when they are meeting me as I do think this restaurant is what many of them ( being from LA and in the entertainment industry) are used to, but personally, I would never go to the Lark without an invitation. \n\nFinally, the service has not been great the times I have been invited here. On one occasion the server forgot about us at the communal table finally forcing us to get up and order at the bar, and on another, we were served faulty wine and had to wait for ages before another bottle was brought to us. If you love pairing wine and food, you will understand how frustrating this it is to have your hot food in front of you, but wine yet to be delivered.   This is why I give the Lark only 3 stars. \n\nI appreciate the chef centered menu and as the food is seasonal, will probably be back to give it another go and update my review if need be but 2 variables are required to change in order for me to augment my star rating and those are; improved service AND (considering the price) for The Lark to WOW me with the food.","4948":"The fried chicken was spectacular. The crudo tuna was fresh as well as for the located from Washington oysters: the strawberry daqurri was the perfect amount. Had 3... the chicken was very juicy and tenders highly recommended! Not dry at all.","4949":"We came here for my birthday dinner and had a wonderful dining experience! The staff was very friendly and the food is so tasty! Even though it was Covid and a few things had to be modified, we felt that the restaurant made the best of it!","4950":"We really enjoyed our dinner here. The food is very unique and the chefs know how to pair food! We got the crispy brussel sprouts and they were a-mazing! The atmosphere was very nice and the wait staff were quite attentive.","4951":"For such a highly reviewed place with great reviews on yelp, I was sorely disappointed by this restaurant. \nMy bf & I stayed for a whopping 20 minutes and left because both the service and food were so mediocre.\n\nI made a reservation on a Fri during COVID and were promptly seated.\n\nFOOD:\n- Brussels sprouts +1\/5\nWhile the server tried to explain that the marinade was what made the the Brussels sprouts taste smoky, I think they straight up tasted burnt. \nAnd yes, it doesn't take much to distinguish whether a food item is burnt or has a marinade. We sent this back and asked for the kitchen to have it less burnt. \nOur server then comes back to say that they'll take it off the bill but never brought back the \"fixed\" Brussels sprouts so we just were left.. hungry.\n- Oysters +3\/5\nWhile these exploded with flavor, I have to say that I felt like the kitchen was trying too hard because there were TOO many flavors. \nFrom floral to tart to tangy, I was left with mixed emotions about these. I given 2 extra stars, however, because they were clearly very fresh.\n- Octopus +3\/5\nI order these dish fairly often whenever I go to a tapa-style restaurant and this was by-far the saltiest, most overcooked one that I tried.\nThe octopus quality was fair but the bf & I literally had to wash down each bite with water because it was just that salty.\n\nSERVICE:\n- our server seemed to stop caring after we sent the Brussels sprouts back but the manager kindly came to express his apology for our convenience.\nHe even offered to help us make a reservation at their sister restaurant the next day but we would be leaving the morning after so we couldn't take him up on his offer.\n\nWhile I realize that our dishes could've been the only ones that were poorly executed this night, I doubt that I will want to come back again.\nWhile the manager tried to alleviate our experience, the server's dismissal of our table after we sent back the Brussels sprouts along with the dishes that weren't up to our standards left us with a sad dinner experience.","4952":"The ambiance, and of course the food is exquisite and the service was perfect!  This is great place to come and eat right off of state street - the hotel is really, really nice too!!","4953":"I realize this review will not be popular but for individuals who want to eat healthy food, you might think twice about the LARK. Yes the food is very flavorful and rich in veggies, but for my taste it's way over the top. I wonder to the chef: How much salt, sugar and fat do you really need to add to you menu items? For example, did you really need to deep fry the brussels sprouts and then add dates, bacon and an overly sweet sauce to make them palatable? Obviously the place is a big hit, with its bold flavors and creative dishes but you could use half the salt and sugar and still succeed.","4954":"one of my favorite places ever. go in and ask for recommendations, the fried chicken is always on the menu and is the best fried chicken you'll ever eat. crispy, not greasy, great sauces with it. we ordered the asparagus dish as well with goat cheese that was incredible. food that is unique and you'll never find anywhere else. worth the price for the experience. great atmosphere too, we had our own fire pit outside.","4955":"A reservations type place in downtown Santa Barbara.  Valet parking is required. Be sure to validate before leaving or its $10. The atmosphere is business casual, but could be okay to go up a step up.  The theme is rustic upscale.  The wait staff is pleasant, helpful and knowledgable.  This is important because part of the experience is understanding how to order.  It was fun either way.","4956":"Great food and drinks. One of my favorite spots for dinner when I'm visiting Santa Barbara.","4957":"Beautiful restaurant, lovely ambiance, great service.  Limited vegetarian menu.  Didn't love their selection of tequila.","4958":"So disappointed by my experience at The Lark. I am vacationing in Santa Barbara from San Francisco and The Lark was a recommendation from a fellow travel, food, and wine blogging friend. \n\nThe ambiance and food was good. The service was not. There was not one or two mistakes, but a series of 5+ mistakes. All started well with our server, but things quickly fell apart. \n\nI have celiac disease and told this to our server right away. We then asked for his recommendation on the wagyu short rib or lamb ribs. He emphatically recommended the wagyu short rib, so we ordered that, along with the wedge salad, scallops, and two cocktails. We told Wyatt we would order wine with the meat later. \n\nMisstep #1: We only received one cocktail.\nMisstep #2: We received the wedge salad with croutons.\nMisstep #3: Dishware and silverware not replaced after the wedge salad; plates and forks were covered in Gorgonzola cheese and a smoky dressing.\n\nWe ordered wine. Our server recommended one to taste and brought it out to taste, which brings us to misstep #4: he never brought out the full glass of wine. \n\nMisstep #5: After finishing the scallops, he brought out the dessert menus. We then pointed out all of these missteps because we had several people working our table, and asked if he forgot about our wagyu short rib. He responded \"ok, ok, ok\" and didn't offer any apology or solution; Wyatt simply asked if we \"still wanted the short rib\". At this point I was incredibly frustrated and told him to forget it. We left without a main course, and the experience soured a fun dinner in Santa Barbara. \n\nI wanted to love and recommend The Lark to friends, and readers\/followers of my blog. However, service is highly important to me. At times we felt forgotten. With the number of mistakes and failure to own\/course correct them, I could not recommend The Lark.","4959":"We dined here on Valentine's this year and were incredibly delighted with our choice! The ambience was very romantic with candlelit dining and an outdoor fireplace. \n\nWe shared the beets, cauliflower, hamachi crudo, and beef cheeks -- plus a few cocktails. The vegetable dishes were my favorite dishes of the night. They let the vegetables shine which was really impressive. The beets were my favorite while the cauliflower was my boyfriend's first choice. \n\nThe crudo dish was slightly clunky for me. I would have liked the fish and olives to be cut in thinner slices. However, the olives, blood oranges, and serrano peppers added a nice balance of sweetness and heat.\n\nThe beef cheeks were our least favorite of the night. While the beef cheeks were very tender, the sauce and the bacon fat potatoes were so oily it was hard to eat. This dish made us regret not getting the fried chicken for our entree to share. \n\nI would definitely give The Lark a try if you find yourself in Santa Barbara. Make sure to make a reservation well in advance as they are a very busy joint!","4960":"We came here to celebrate my moms 60th birthday and the restaurant has great ambiance, but the food was hit and miss. \nThe complimentary popcorn was amazing! The roasted brussel sprouts was also amazing, but then it went downhill. \nChicken skin had good texture, but an off putting gamey taste. The tomato with burrata had a strange, strong, almost artificial smoky taste. The pork belly, oh Lordy, I order pork belly at almost any new American restaurant I go to and it's always been a great experience, but this was a fail for me. I am not fatphopic, give me butter and cook with lard any day, but this dish was just wads of undercooked (not raw) pork fat that was just soft and greasy in the mouth. Blech. This perhaps disappointing of all the waygu beef. Chewy wads of meat and $44 to add salt to the wound. Disappointing.","4961":"I consider myself a foodie and this was one of my favorite dining experience in ages!  Love, love, loved everything.  Great ambiance.  Our server was charming.  And I don't even know where to start on the food....excellent!  I wish I lived closer.  Can't wait to go back!","4962":"First off, fantastic service. They were so friendly, anticipated our needs, and were so accommodating. The food was delicious and adventurous. The muscles had a surprising mix of flavors that worked beautifully. Even a basic fried chicken was elevated by a unique sauce. Wonderful atmosphere for a nice celebratory dinner.","4963":"Popcorn!  \n\nThey serve popcorn, rather than dinner rolls, while you wait for your order. We ordered 3 refills. Curry popcorn is now a favorite food to eat. The wine ambassador at one of the tasting rooms on State Street highly recommended the popcorn and we thought it was a passing comment from someone who really likes popcorn. We are now popcorn fans. \n\nThe service was pleasant and efficient. \n\nThe food was as delicious. We started with their nectarine and cucumber salad. It was light and refreshing. Perfect for the warm day. The oysters with watermelon granita was the highlight of our meal. It seems we should have ordered the fried chicken as we saw plates of it go by. We ordered the hanger steak, and while it was well-seasoned, it did not wow me like the oysters and popcorn. Next time, we will order the chicken. \n\nMeals are served family style. My husband and I shared a salad, an appetizer, a main course and a dessert. We were stuffed. Depending on what you order and your level of hungry, you may or may not need to order more dishes than the dishes we ordered. \n\nI strongly suggest making a reservation as this place was full to capacity. They have indoor and patio seating. Bring a sweater if you plan to eat on the patio. Once the sun dips down, it can be chilly.","4964":"Food's great.  Creative and spot on.  But the trendy (and tired)  \"shared plates\" style and menu leads to confusion and over-ordering.  Even though our waiter told it intend \"a lot of food\" we went ahead.  Our bad.  But a better explanation and menu is called for.  Also, we sat just inside the restaurant and on this December night both front doors were flung open and cold air breezes in.  I get it - COVID restrictions.  Still annoying.  Inside was chaotic and loud - lots of folks I am sure think this is the mark of a winning place, but it was clearly a decibel attack and a challenge to communicate.  But on the things that really matter:  loved the food, had a bunch of leftover and a reasonable corkage - I'll give it 4 stars.  But clearly I can't say this is a \"must do\".  Other SB spots rival the food with a better experience (for me).","4965":"We ordered one of the \"Family Dinners\" using Curbside pickup.  I so much appreciate the curbside option during Covid.  The meal was fantastic!!!  We had Dinner for two includes: Roasted Butternut Squash & Fuji Apples, Cast Iron Roasted Cauliflower, Hand Cut Tagliatelle Pasta, Valrhona Chocolate Budino.  Everything was outstanding, except for the Tagliatelle which was mediocre.  Everything was packaged and presented nicely.  We brought it home, opened up a nice bottle of local wine, and sat by the fire and enjoyed a nice dinner.  Our entire dinner was $55 for two people.  For what we got and how nicely it was prepared, I thought it was reasonably priced. It was nice to have a simple pleasure during these very difficult times and support a local restaurant at the same time.","4966":"Great location, had an amazing dinner there with my parents.  Great if you love to sample foods with complex taste profile.  Plus their fried chicken is killer!","4967":"Elevated dining experience. From start to finish this was a fantastic meal. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu. I greatly appreciated our server checking in about our dietary needs to help guide us in ordering the right dishes for us. The cuisine had Mediterranean\/ Middle Eastern influence and spices and was gorgeously plated. The craft cocktails were truly special and equally beautiful in presentation. Its hard to say what I enjoyed most, but I really think ambience sets the tone for a restaurant. Both the outdoor garden patios as well as the warm brick interior made for a very comfortable aesthetic. Especially now post Covid I think it's harder for restaurants to operate at this level - so when they go above and beyond it really should be recognized.","4968":"The lark is a local favorite and it's on every list of top restaurants in Santa Barbara. We really wanted to love this place and had high expectations based on what we read. \n\nThe ambiance is very warm and welcoming with a winding brick outdoor patio lined with iron fireplaces. We went on a Wednesday with reservations and we were glad we did because it was buzzing. \n\nThe catch here for us was the food. We were told that the style was small shared plates and multiple were recommended but the portion sizes were huge. We came hungry and order four plates but only managed to have a few bites of each. I recommend ordering less than you think you might need.\n\nWe ordered a seasonal squash pasta that had every ingredient that I love. The pasta came out so salty that it we weren't able to eat it. I'm the biggest fan of pasta and would have found any excuse to eat it if I could. We also ordered a fig and burrata tartine that sounded amazing but didn't taste as good as it looked. The ingredients didn't really make sense together and it was very heavy. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed the vibe and were having a great time away in Santa Barbara, so this wasn't a huge miss for us. But if we came with high foodie expectations we would have been disappointed.","4969":"Food is good not great. The sauce that came with the hanger steak totally over powered it. Again the green beans were smothered in a sauce and toppings that completely over powered them. Both hanger steak and green beans are wonderful on their own! The cuts of tuna in the crudo were mediocre. And lastly service sucked. We waited a good 10 minutes before our server came to greet us, then only to ask what kind of water we wanted... we had to ask to order our drinks. We brought a wine and she asked if she should pop it to let it breath and we said yes, but 10 minutes later she had not gotten to it and we had to stop her and ask. Once we had our food, which we got one at a time, she came by once to check on us. It was our anniversary so she did surprise us with a dessert which was a nice touch. Overall the food is overpriced for what it is and the hospitality needs A LOT of work. Expect to \"work\" to get service.","4970":"A local highly recommended this place.  It's insanely popular and difficult to get a reservation.  So plan ahead!\n\nFood:  everything was cooked well.  No dish stood out.  My only complaint is food here can be slightly one dimensional.... with a heavy emphasis on sour\/acidity.  From the mocktails to the apps and main courses... everything was sour.  The curry popcorn was so addicting we might have asked for 2nds, 3rds or 4ths?  Yums\n\nAmbiance:  very cool hip vibes and very busy!  \n\nService: fast efficient and friendly.  We had a baby stroller with us and they accommodated \n\nThe restaurant location is a little hidden.  Be patient when you're looking for this place as it's tucked away past a common area.","4971":"Best palomas in town! We came here the weekend of dine-in reopening after COVID-19 and this place did not disappoint. There is a very cute outside seating area, that has a great summertime vibe with a food truck (for decoration) and string lights! This place allows puppies, soooo that's also a plus, because who doesn't want to stare at cute doggos while they enjoy a yummy meal?! \n\nTheir cocktails are delicious. I cannot recommend their paloma or mule enough! \n\nFor apps, their Brussels sprouts and smoked crab & artichoke dip is tasty. \n\nFor a main meal, their hanger steak served over shishitos was SO DELICIOUS! \n\nI recommend coming here in your prettiest summer sundress & bringing great company with you to enjoy the night!","4972":"Sorry was really disappointed.  We had a party of 11.  They put us in the back corner where the waiter couldn't get to the people against the wall so every time food\/drinks\/napkins\/silverware came to us I had to pass it down.  The food all came out at different times- which they told us would happen but waiting an hour for the chicken dish when they said it would be 25 minutes was unacceptable.  Our bill and to over 700 dollars and our waiter made us feel like we were not wanted.  We had to always ask for water, alcoholic beverages took a long time to get to us sometimes we had asked twice for them. The food was mediocre at best. We tried almost everything on the menu and no one thought the food was very good.  There are so many great restaurants in Santa Barbara-  would not go back.  But it was packed with people- so there must be a following.","4973":"We are visiting from NY and chose to spend our last evening here at The Lark, at the recommendation of a friend who grew up here. What a mistake. Menu is quite limited and very overpriced. My boyfriend had his heart set on the lamb ribs only to have our waitress tell us the kitchen was out of them. She offered no suggestion of what else he should order so he went with the fried quail. That is not enough food for anyone to make a meal out of! We also ordered the pappardelle, which took well over 40 minutes to come out. Even more offensive is that the tables on either side of us received their food quickly. How long does it take to make pasta?? We had to ask her to check on it twice. We were left starving, disgusted and infuriated we wasted time and money here. Do better.","4974":"Tucked in the Funk Zone, the Lark has a hip exposed brick interior, paired with farm to fresh table food. They had some fun non-alcoholic options, including a refreshing jalape\u00f1o peach spritz. For dinner, we split the fried chicken and the hangar steak, both which were delicious. We were worried that it wasn't enough food for the two of us, but it was actually the perfect amount. The fried chicken was juicy and came with a delicious sauce. The hangar steak was cooked perfectly and complemented the fresh vegetables nicely.","4975":"I'd give the service a 2.5 just because our food came out at drastically different times. my burger, then the fish 10+ minutes later, then the chicken about 10 more minutes after that. however, the restaurant is new so i'll cut them some slack.\n\nbut WOW. the 4 is for the food- everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic. the menu, although relatively limited, is to die for. the fish and chicken were so well done with unique and delicious sides (fennel, grapefruit slaw? yum!) & the atmosphere is lovely, with such cool light fixtures, horizontal succulent walls outside, and concrete floors. the staff was also extremely friendly & helpful.\n\nthey even had a birthday card waiting at the table upon our arrival for our mom & included a complimentary pot de creme dessert for our celebration (which was out of this world).\n\nthe only complaints were the kinks in the food timing, & the drinks were only okay. they sound a lot cooler \/ more creative than they were- the egg white margarita, mule, etc. were just okay. I love the idea of farm fresh ingredients & premium alcohol only, but these ones are not necessarily worth the price. anchor did it way better. also it gets VERY hot inside, so either try to get a spot outside or go on a cooler night because it gets stuffy.\n\nOverall, so thankful to everyone at The Lark for making my mom's birthday such a fun, delicious, and just wonderful experience. can't wait to try it again.","4976":"I went to The Lark last week for a friend's birthday dinner and loved it. Definitely one of the best new places in town. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is really fun and energetic. The cocktails were great, too and we loved the outside seating. Think the valet was having an off night...they seemed a little bored and inattentive...almost like they didn't want to be there. :(","4977":"We came here for dinner and had a phenomenal culinary experience! We reserved a table outside on their spacious patio and once we sat down our sever brought over the most delicious tasting popcorn. It had a wonderful spice to it and was very hard not to devour the entire thing in two seconds. We did have to ask to be moved to a different table outside as the one we were originally seated at was surrounded by these little birds that kept flying by our head and trying to get close to our popcorn. It was just a little annoying and I wanted to make sure we enjoyed our dinner, which we ended up doing. They like to serve everything family style so you order all items at once and they come out all together. We ended up ordering three items for the two of us to share...we went with the Whipped Sheep's Feta & Pistachio Dip, Crispy Halloumi & Butternut Squash, and the Grilled Prime Hanger Steak. Everything had phenomenal flavor and the hanger steak came with these blistered shishitos peppers which were prepared to perfection! The three courses were a perfect amount of food for the two of us. The service started out really good as the restaurant wasn't too crowded but once the place started to fill in, the attentiveness faded off a little. Wasn't too big of a deal but was just something we noticed. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience and cannot wait to come back again!!","4978":"Amazing! Seated right away at socially distanced tables. Got the tagliatelle and beef cheeks - we were blown away! Incredible flavors that were unique and delicious. Finished with the tahini ice cream which may be the best dessert we've ever had. Best part? KYLE! Our waiter, Kyle, explained everything, gave great suggestions and was an overall delight during our entire experience. I would add 5 extra stars just for his superb service.","4979":"Loved this restaurant!! The decorations were so cute and elegant with romantic lighting. Our group was seated at the family style table which you could easily socialize at with other parties if the occasion called for it. The food was made to perfection without a doubt. My other girlfriends enjoyed as well but I was secretly blown away by their cornbread. Should've asked for the recipe lol. Lark was definitely the highlight of my foodventures in the area!","4980":"We were a party of 6 celebrating a special occasion. I had made a reservation weeks in advance and asked for a cake, that they declined to do. We decided to go ahead with the place even so, and we're glad we did.\n\nWe ate through most of the menu:\nDevilled Eggs - delicious, but not mind blowing\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts - I see what the hype is all about, really interesting take on an unloved vegetable. And yummy!\nMarinated & Grilled Boneless Short Rib - loved the steak. Nicely done... a bit on the salty side though.\nHamachi CRudo - The avocado dish and all the other accents like the jicama and the orange etc. made the dish\nTexas Gulf Coast Redfish - if you like sharp flavors this dish is for you. The redfish itself was unmemorable, but the dirty rice and creole shrimp sauce is what we'll remember\nSlow Roasted Superior Farms Lamb Ribs - This was hands down our favorite. The medjool date caramel on the lamb ribs made them out of the world. The fennel was a delicious touch. We almost ordered a second plate.\nMary's Roasted Chicken - chicken was succulent. Grits were yummy and okra was awesome.\n\nDessert\nWe had the goat cheese cheesecake profiteroles, spring doughnut, chocolate tres leches cake and the banana cream & hibiscus. It was all super delicious.\n\nI really do recommend going to this restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. Do go with a large group, so you can really taste your way through the menu.","4981":"We had reservations on Sunday at 7pm. It was busy when we arrived. There's outdoor and indoor seatings. We opt for outdoors. It was really aired out above us and the sides. There was complimentary flavored popcorn to start. We ordered the crispy brussels sprouts, Santa Barbara Hope Ranch Mussels, Morro Bay Black Cod, Wayne Farms Buttermilk Fried Chicken, and grilled Creekstone Prime Hanger Steak. Everything was good. But the hanger steak wasn't as tender as I liked it. Service was fast and good. We also drank some wine. Wines were good and prices are standard.","4982":"We were a little underwhelmed with this place. Food and drinks were good but nothing special for the price point. The server told us to order family style, as their dishes all have generous portions but that didn't really seem to be the case. We ordered oysters, the prawns, the tagliatelle, and another appetizer and they all just seemed like normal entree sizes. Food was very flavorful however. I just don't think this place was anything to write home about and it was quite pricy.","4983":"We have been here many times and although the food is great, the service is always lacking.  We did not have a reservation so we got the last seating on a Saturday night - it was close to 10pm.  We ordered some salads, 2 burgers and 1\/2 rotisserie chicken.  Apps came out just fine, then burgers but no chicken.  Everyone at the table was finished with their meal and still no chicken.  Our server said to us, \"I could just kill my kitchen tonight\" when we asked why the chicken was taking so long and if we could cancel it.  She said we could not cancel it - in all the years I waited tables not once did I tell my customers they could not cancel an order, especially when fault was on myself or kitchen.  So we simply waited for the chicken....  Someone ordered hot tea which took about 20 minutes to get to the table.  Chicken finally came, then bill, nothing comped, nothing offered.  I don't believe our server notified management of the issue as I assume someone would have spoken to us and at least apologized.","4984":"I've been here quite a few times and I make the trek to just sit and enjoy the Brussel sprouts with dates, and I mean literally medjool dates. Yes, that's it. I like everything else, but those Brussel sprouts got me each and every time. Make sure to book online for reservations and you also may get lucky as a walk in although there is no guarantee. Start off with a special drink or glass of wine, ask for a booth if you can or enjoy the outside CA vibes, then enjoy a dinner shared with loved ones or just a plate of yummy Brussels on your own! Mmmmmm! Can't wait to go back.","4985":"Came here the other week with my wife and some coworkers for dinner. I really like the ambience and the customer service is on point here. They describe the fresh ingredients used in each dish they serve at the table and the drink specials are super tasty.\n\nOur table shared the crispy brussel sprouts, which were really good and our table finished it quickly. \n\nI shared the wedge salad with my wife, and it too was really good, with large chunks of blue cheese, and the thick cut candied bacon was a perfect compliment, to the spicy pecan crunch.\n\nFor my main entree, I had ordered the lamb, and unfortunately it missed the mark for me. The lamb was a dry, overcooked and lacking flavor.\n\nI almost order the \"grilled ribeye for 2\" which I believe was a 12 oz ribeye. 2 coworkers ordered it and I tried some of it. While it isn't a thick cut, it was tender and flavorful.\n\n It is a bit dark in the restaurant so taking pictures of the food can be difficult without an obnoxious flash. \n\nAll in all, i think the food is a bit over priced for what you get, but the location, service, and ambience makes up for it. I'll be back to try out other items before making this my final review.","4986":"While some of the dishes we ordered felt a bit like modern experiments, they were all excellent, including the chocolate brownie dessert with grapes. The cod may have been the tastiest main course of our weekend trip. \n\nThe environment was hip and our outdoor seat surrounded us with an eclectic mix of persons from around the world. Our server was also very good. I also appreciated the fact that they offered NA beer.","4987":"Most dining expereinces out are enjoyable (because we check reviews first before we go:)). Rarely am I shocked at the quality of a chef and a kitchen's skills as I was on New Years Eve at the Lark. There is attention to detail at every level. Front of the house staff are well educated in the product they serve and take pride in providing a top end expereince. We had the Beet and Pear Appetizer and the Fried Chicken for the main course, both executed with finese and skill. For a treat we endulged in both the brownie and olive oil cake, each excellent. The specialty drinks for the evening were wonderful as was the pairing recommendation by John our waitstaff.   There are great restaurants in California and places such as Santa Barbara, rarely do I come across a location where execution at all levels of a meal leaves me in Awe. Well Done!","4988":"great food, family style plates made for sharing. great service, each plate was cleared and replaced before the next course and the food came out quickly. three courses in about 1.25 hours. nice atmosphere outside with a fire and a heater.","4989":"I really enjoyed our meal here. We over-ordered and left the place happily stuffed. Be advised that a reservation is a near-requirement on a weekend night, and the only way our group of 4 got around that was to arrive at 5:30 and hope for the best. We lucked out and got seated immediately, but had to leave by 7:00 (plenty of time).\n\nDeviled Eggs - delicious, with an adorable pancetta topping that looks like mini-bacon.\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts - surprisingly, just on par with what you'd get at a self-respecting gastropub. Every version of this dish I've tried has been bold enough to get it right, so this actually felt like one of the more average offerings of the meal.\nSouthern Pimento Cheese - also highly recommended. Comes with a kick!\nOysters - did not try these myself but they came highly recommended. Not for the faint of stomach.\nGarganelli Pasta & Whole Confit Goat - my entree and my favorite of the night. Large penne-type pasta in a rich confit that is just short of gamey. Loved this dish!\nBlack Garlic Glazed Lamb Shank - a beast of an entree. This was huge, and I'm told delicious, but holy smokes I could barely bring myself to look at it by this point in the meal.\nThey make a good Old Fashioned.\n\nOur service was great and we Uber'd our way through town so didn't need to take advantage of their complimentary valet (with validation). Would love to go back to SB to visit this place again!","4990":"I'll keep my review simple.  Heard a lot of hype about this place and was hoping to not be let down.  We weren't.  Been there a few times and the food was excellent.  Worth the wait for a reservation - you're sure to have a memorable meal and the location itself is beautifully set up.","4991":"Good place for sharing food. The food itself is high quality and well cooked. Need to make reservation if you can.\n\nBlack cod: 10\/10. Tender and tasted.\n\nLamb Kabob: 9\/10 . A little overcooked. Otherwise, it's perfect.\n\nCrab toast: 10\/0.  Crabs on two pieces of bread.\n\nPistachio Dip: 10\/10. I specifically like this type of chips they are using.\n\nCrudo: 11\/10. Yes. You read it right. More than 10. Fish skin and raw trout. This is the best I got from them.\n\nTheir draft beers were good too.","4992":"Came here to celebrate NYE and we got the halloumi, lamb, and feta\/pistachio dip. The lamb was our favorite and was seasoned perfectly and came with in the perfect portion size for 2. The halloumi also worked well with the butternut squash. The pistachio dip was a bit off with a somewhat strange floral taste that didn't quite go with the rest of the dish (according to us). \nOverall we enjoyed our experience- the staff was friendly and helpful and passed out glasses of bubbly to celebrate the new year at the end of our dinner !","4993":"This is the first review I have ever posted. That is how strongly I feel about my position. I will not return to this restaurant. I made a reservation on December 14 for the evening of December 26. We wanted to take our son who is visiting from Boston out for a special evening. We are local Santa Barbara residents who patronize Santa Barbara restaurants on a regular basis. My husband is 70 years old and I am 68 years old. We specifically requested outdoor seating as we had done only a couple of weeks before  when we had been there with friends  for dinner on 12\/11 because we do not sit inside restaurants as a result of Covid. On 12\/11 there was no issue. When my reservation was confirmed via text, it reminded me to dress warmly because it was chilly outside. When we arrived for our dinner reservation on time, we were told that we would have to sit inside and that no outside seating was available. We were told at that time for the very first time that outside seating was not guaranteed. There was outside seating available but we were told they were being saved for a large group of 12 and another group of six. Somehow these people  were able to obtain guarantees for outdoor seating but we were not. Yes the food and service is good but our treatment as local Santa Barbara residents was abysmal. We left with no dinner and a ruined evening.","4994":"Great place! The food was great, and the place for great! We sat outside on their patio on a warm spring night. The place was very full, but they were able to quickly accomodate our group even though we were late for our reservation.\n\nThey offer seasoned popcorn to munch on as you peruse the menus, but if you ask for bread, they have that as well.\n\nOur group of 5 got and shared the crispy brussel sprouts (which had a great sauce), carmelize asian pears and red kale (which was a huge plate of kale), honey glazed rainbow carrots (with housemade fromage blanc which was very tasty), marinated and grilled hanger steak (which was cooked to a perfect medium-rare), yellowtail hamachi crudo, and farmers market pappardelle (with lots of veggies). Between all that food and 6 drinks (great cocktails), our total came to about $200.\n\nWould definitely come back here again!","4995":"Truly a delicious \"Shared Dining Experience\" here in the heart of the Santa Barbara Funk Zone.\n\nWe kept hearing about the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Winter Beets & Marinated Burrata, Caramelized Cauliflower, Cast Iron Morro Bay Black Cod, Creekstone  Prime Hanger Steak, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. With our large group we fortunately got to try them all . . . and each one was incredibly delicious.\n\nNotable wine-by-the-glass which was perfect for the entire meal: Grimm's Bluff, Happy Canyon, Rose of Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nAs cool as this special night was we were seated outside and comfortably next to one of their fireplaces, and surrounded by their portable heaters. \n\nOur server Laurel stuck with us from beginning to end, and she made sure the food came out promptly, and was excellent with her wine and cocktails recommendations. Can't say enough how thorough she was in making sure our night was special. Also special thanks to host Alberto for keeping an eye on us throughout the evening. \n\nHighly recommend making reservations to this very special restaurant as it is truly a hot-spot in Santa Barbara. Afterwards Alberto walked us next door to Pearl Social for a continued evening of specialty cocktails.","4996":"After spending an evening wandering around the touristy restaurants on State Street, I decided to yelp restaurants in the area and came upon The Lark.  Hidden away in an artsy district of galleries, wine tasting rooms, and hip bars, The Larks is a gem.  \n\nThe food was really excellent.  The brussel sprouts were so delicious and rich I almost thought I was eating meat, and the cheese plate was probably the most beautiful cheese plate ever to be assembled.  I could have skipped the deviled eggs, but then again I'm not really a fan of deviled eggs to begin with. \n\nThe ambience was perhaps even better than the food.  We sat at a tiny little table outside with our dog, and it was perfect.  The warm lights, fire pit, and quiet chatter made for a most romantic evening.","4997":"THE FOOD - expect to share, served family style\n(ranked from favorite to least favorite)\n\nGrilled peaches - I was skeptical about this one but it was a great dish\n\nSouthern pimento cheese tartine - packed full of flavor\n\nComplimentary popcorn - this was too addicting, they gave us a plate once we asked for more\n\nRosemary cornbread - just as the name sounds, wasn't dry at all\n\nI guess in the grand scheme of things, I was underwhelmed with the execution of most of their proteins which is why they ranked lower here.\n\nSpanish octopus\n\nTrout - very similar to salmon\n\nCrispy duck confit\n\nRibeye steak for two - this was my least favorite dish and for a $60 price tag, it was not money well spent. The meat didn't have that lusciousness that I think of when biting into a ribeye. I think there was about 5-6 slices on this (luckily we got two for the table) but I could easily get a nice steak with side elsewhere.\n\n---\nTHE SERVICE\nCassie was great, service with a smile and always made sure we were taken care of.\n\n---\nMAIN GRIPE\nWe had reservations to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party. Toward the end of the evening, we were about to wrap things up when we noticed that a few other people had gotten seated at the table next to us. Moments later, someone from that group came up to us and asked if we could speed things up (not in a friendly manner at all) because they had been waiting 30 minutes over their reservation time. First of all, not my problem and second, where do you get off trying to blame us for keeping you from being seated? I was surprised that even half of their party got seated because that made it very clear who needed to leave (us) before they could get seated. The restaurant also never gave us any indication on when we needed to leave--if they had, we would have honored it. And mind you, we weren't just sitting there telling our life stories, we consistently ordered drinks throughout the evening.","4998":"Let the record show- I update reviews when my next visit exceeds my previous one. Trouble is, rarely go back to a place that had once underwhelmed me.... UNLESS I'm there by invitation. \n\nThis was just the case with the Lark. \n\nI recently went back to the Lark as an invited dinner guest with a couple friends and was able to snag a seat at the communal table without having to wait in line.\n\nOur meal was absolutely delicious we enjoye the sumptuously sweet and savory duck leg confit over polenta, chared balsamic Brussels sprouts, some sort of Persian inspired cucumber salad with yogurt dressing (which was actually my favorite dish) and several cocktails. \n\nI was only disappointed in the wine left wine list which left much to be desired and lacked sufficient options for by the glass purchases ( there were maybe only 5\/7 BTG options) . \n\nService was OK, not stellar but good. \n\nI recommend they spend some more time curating their wine list. They are on their way to becoming something great.","4999":"I wanted to love The Lark. I thought I would love the Lark.  I planned to love The Lark. But I didn't love The Lark. \n\nIt's absolutely beautiful--the restaurant, the cocktails, the food, even the people serving the food. \n\nWe were seated and took some time to admire the design of the restaurant--there are really fantastic details everywhere you look, from the chandeliers inside, to the fire pit grate outside, to the mismatched silverware. And I was excited about the family-style service...I love getting to try a bunch of different dishes. This place was living up to all my expectations!\n\nAfter placing drink orders, we chatted for a really long time before our food order was taken. No problem--I like a leisurely pace. \n\nFinally, my cocktail, the California rattlesnake, arrived. Made with bourbon, lemon, absinthe, and egg white foam, I was surprised to find it a bit one-dimensional and flat. But I was not yet disheartened...surely this was a one-off. \n\nThe first few courses were really wonderful:  Brussels sprouts with dates and lime in a fish sauce--crispy, savory; a stone fruit and burrata salad with cashew praline and pickled cherries--bright, light, balanced; the little gems wedge--crisp and creamy; the pimiento cheese spread--smoky, spicy; and the Dungeness crab gnocchi--pillowy, rich, so delicious. Each was beautifully plated and equally enjoyable to eat. Just what I was hoping for!\n\nThis is when things sort of fell apart. We had a half hour lull. No food, no server checking on us, no water refills, no nothing. We had an 8:30 reservation, so by now it was getting close to 10:00. We were hungry. We were tired-ish. This was not what I had envisioned. \n\nIt was with much excitement that we eyed a server bringing a beautiful entr\u00e9e to our table. Alas, it was the Jidori chicken, which we had not ordered. Sigh. We sent it back reluctantly, and settled a bit deeper into disappointment. \n\nA few minutes later, our server stopped by the table to inform us that the kitchen was backed up, apologize for the wait, and tell us our entr\u00e9es were on their way. She offered a gratis glass of wine, which we appreciated but we declined...just wanted our food. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later, they brought out our crispy trout and short rib (both recommended by our server). The trout, served with pole beans, cilantro pistou, squid, cherry tomatoes and garnished with two deep fried squash blossoms, was surprisingly unflavorful. The beans added nothing and were texturally problematic for me. The trout was well cooked, but overall the dish was meh. The short rib was beautiful, but not so great in the flavor or tenderness departments. Also there just was not very much of it. The morsels of summer squash served with it were amazing. The shishito peppers were a bit undercooked. My lack of love for this experience was being further confirmed. \n\nThe desserts were, overall, underwhelming. Not bad, but not fantastic. Each had a lot of elements, and some of them were really wonderful, but on the whole they just didn't rock my world. Which is too bad, because I really love desserts that rock my world. They did comp one of our desserts because of the long wait, which was nice. But still...I did not love The Lark. \n\nMaybe it was an off night. Maybe this wasn't a typical experience. Maybe if I came back, I would love The Lark. Now I just have to convince my husband that we should give it another shot.","5000":"Fun space and really good food. I love how the neighboring restaurant and a DJ and stringed lights. The ambiance felt communal while still keeping social distance in place.\n\nOur server was a little absent but I felt she made up for it once she knew we were waiting a bit to start by ordering our wine.\n\nWe would definitely return.","5001":"WOW, THE BEST local Farm to Table dining experience I've had!  A must try for anyone who appreciates a creative, fresh and phenomenal culinary experience with a quaint outdoor (also have inside dining) setting!  What struck me is their attention to food prep details ... each dish ordered had SO many ingredients to make it perfect, and then served to your table a dish or two at a time \"family\" style.  Loved everything about their foods; and very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive service gives it extra high marks.  Recommend making a reservation for this 5.0+ rating in my book.  App costs are $12-18, and entrees range $20-40, but so worth it for a special celebration or gathering!\n\nFor me, the Cast Iron Mediterranean Branzino and Grilled Prime Hanger steak were at the top of the list for entrees.  Branzino fish was tender, mild and flaky, served with a light and fresh salad creation!  The Hanger steak was grilled perfectly, melted in your mouth and served with a rich, flavorful sauce and fresh veggies.  Neither will disappoint any foodie!\n\nThe Lamb Shawarma Rillettes was unique and amazing too, served with sea salt lavash and fresh veggies charcuterie style!  And their Buttermilk Fried Chicken was excellent; an upscale version that makes comfort food truly delightful!\n\nFor apps, don't miss their Crispy Brussel Sprouts - so good it could be a meal by itself.  And the Marinated Mushroom Tartine is one of a kind, gotta try one if your a \"shroom\" fan!\n\nI could keep going but I'm sure you have a picture of how great this dining experience was for me.  When back in SB, this is one of the first places I'll return.  ENJOY!!!","5002":"It was the experience that did it for me. The food was really good., but Breana D., our server was the best! I have a pepper allergy (certain chilies) and she took time to caution me against certain meals and gave me great alternatives. She was so very attentive and kind.\n\nThe rest in my group had the Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Crispy Pork Belly. \"Uhhhhhh my gawd amazing!\" is how they described them. The Brussels sprouts have peppers in them so I was unable to try them, but they looked wonderful.\n\nWe shared:\nHawaij Mushroom Tartine - a bit vinegary but I'd eat this again. Great \"meaty\" mushroom flavor.\nCast Iron Green Beans - EAT THIS! I loved this. The flavors work very well together.\nGalpin Farms Nectarines & Lemon Cucumbers - Breana recommended removing the fresno chilies, and it was wonderful. Very fresh ingredients.\n\nSo this place has a huge wine, beer, and spirits list. I didn't have anything this time, but intend to return for dessert and a flight of amaro. Because who has amaro flights?!? I can't wait. And of course I'll request Breana's section.","5003":"This place was really underwhelming. After a whole day of wine tasting, my girlfriend and I wanted some light tapas for dinner. Saw great reviews here on Yelp, and the menu sounded delicious. The restaurant was packed and had a hip vibe. We were able to get a seat at a communal table, which was technically inside but behind us was the open patio so we were still able to get fresh air and a nice breeze. There was complimentary popcorn for us, which was good for munching on.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and helpful in recommending what to eat. Unfortunately, we ended up not loving anything we ordered with the exception of the brussels sprouts. This came in a large bowl and is perfect for sharing. \n\nI loveee deviled eggs, but this is the first time I tried one I didn't like. The seasoning on top was just too much, and the flavors were weird.\n\nThe pork belly, usually another one of my favorites, was dry and chewy here. Only came with 3 pieces, but my friend didn't even want more than 1.  \n\nWe were really looking forward to the charcuterie plate to go with more wine. We were expecting a yummy spread of cured meats and cheeses, but instead we got lots of bread and a giant jar of pate. Not terrible tasting, but just not what we wanted. \n\nSo breakdown: 5 stars for atmosphere, which was appropriate and beautiful to end a day in SB; 4 stars for service; 1.5 stars for food, which is the most important factor, so probably won't be coming back.","5004":"My father-in-law turned 71 this month, and Matt B. and I treated him to dinner at The Lark. He's lived in Santa Barbara since the early '70s and had never really hung out in this part of town. I guess it's a trendy area - the block seemed packed with cool restaurants and bars. It felt almost like the east side of L.A.\n\nWe had a 5:15 reservation, which was all we could get a few days in advance. The restaurant was busy - we got a table on the patio adjoining the parking lot (where there was free valet, incidentally), but the back patio and most of the nice inside tables were booked. I really liked the space. The setup was open and the decor was casual but very attractive and carefully appointed. The atmosphere was pleasant and lively. Service was good - our waitress took was attentive, and she laughed at my father-in-law's jokes.\n\nWe drank cocktails with dinner off a small but interesting menu. I loved the Red Hook, a boozy sipper with Templeton rye, Punt e Mes, and maraschino. The Copper and Sand was a sweeter drink made with blended scotch, agave, Carpano Antica, and brandied cherries. We sipped and snacked on a complimentary basket of popcorn flavored with a piquant, satisfying mix of mint, grated ginger, cilantro, lime salt, chile de Arbol, lime zest, and olive oil.\n\nThe Lark encourages family style dining, and we ordered a delicious birthday feast with our waitress's guidance. We started with half portions of the cheese and charcuterie boards. I'd highly recommend both. The cheese board came with three cheeses - Buellton Blue, Humboldt Fog, and Jasper Hill cheddar - along with rosemary black pepper honey, figs, pear membrillo, and crostini. The cheeses were all excellent and the spread of accompaniments tasty and thoughtful. The charcuterie was equally lovely, with soppressata picante, finocchiona salami, prosciutto, granny smith apple mustard, house pickled vegetables, and watercress. The meats were top notch, and I loved them with the colorful assortment of pickles. There was more or less a whole dumped jar of pickled onion, carrot, pepper, and cauliflower - I kept the extra on a separate plate to munch on throughout dinner.\n\nOur waitress recommended about two to three dishes per person, but since we started hefty she actually stopped us at five altogether. That was helpful. We shared the ahi crudo, the scallops, and the ribeye for the rest of our meal, and the last especially left us stuffed. The ahi crudo was our lightest dish, but even that was a decent portion, with at least three big pieces of sashimi for us each. The ahi was great quality, silky and plump. It came with picholine olive tapenade, toasted almonds, grilled cucumber, oregano, and some bright slivers of kumquat. The herb roasted diver scallops were another delightful seafood treat. They were perfectly cooked, with firmness giving into creamy, meaty centers. They came with green beans and fris\u00e9e over a bed of blackeyed peas, Spanish chorizo, grilled sweet corn, summer squash, lime, and cilantro - this succotash was worth spooning up on its own. Finally, we had the pastrami crusted beef ribeye, served with cippolini onions, cherry tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, mustard greens, and a horseradish mustard jus. The portion was huge, with what seemed like a dozen long strips of medium rare ribeye draped over the hearty vegetable sides. The steak was flavorful and tender, and I loved the horseradish and juicy popping cherry tomatoes.\n\nWe shared two desserts, and one of them came with a candle for my father-in-law. Both were delicious. The Meyer lemon tart featured a smooth sour curd on a buttery crust, with poppy seed meringue and blueberry compote on the side. The Tahitian vanilla ice cream sandwich was at least as good, with the ice cream set between chewy hunks of butterscotch blondie, with poached pear and a drizzle of brown butter for fancy points.\n\nThe check came out smaller than expected, due in part to the generous portion sizes. We were all very happy with our meal and the restaurant. Matt and I don't even live in Santa Barbara, but we have plans to revisit The Lark pretty soon.","5005":"Three of us arrived around 8 pm on a Friday and the place was packed! We put our name on the list for an actual table but ended up scoring 3 spots at the communal table in the bar area after about 15 minutes. That whole area is a seat yourself type deal.\n\nFor drinks I ordered a gin based cocktail with citrus and cremant (bubbles) and a cuke garnish... if I'm remembering correctly. I can't recall the name though! It was served in a flute and was absolutely delicious, so of course I ordered another... I mean, it would be silly not to. It was the perfect balance of sweet, tart, fizzy, and refreshing. Yay.\n\nYou get some complimentary spiced popcorn to snack on, which was yummy too. You are supposed to share food here, but my friend and I are not the sharing type. Whatever, do what ever suits you best, you know? So I went with the Rancho La Familia Redbor Kale salad. It was a mountain of kale so if you like kale, this salad is for you. The salad included thinly sliced honeycrisps, crushed hazelnut praline, shaved rainbow carrots, aged gouda, sage and an apple cider vinaigrette. I would have liked more cheese, because cheese. But all the flavors were tasty and went well together. The salad did have the perfect amount of dressing. Note: apparently kale does not absorb alcohol very well so just keep that in mind in case you're planning on boozing. I also had a couple bites of my friend's Late Summer Heirloom Tomatoes--green peppercorn vinaigrette, crispy castelvetrano olives, plots, midnight moon, lavendar mint--uhhh what is this another language? Anyway that's what the online menu says so I think that's what she ordered. I definitely preferred my kale. The tomatoes themselves could have been a little better and this plate is obviously meant to share unless you enjoy noshing on a pile of tomatoes. You do you.\n\nI didn't mind sitting at the communal table, everyone was friendly. We had some group chats and also separate convos as well. Service was decent. No real complaints. This place is a little pricey but the atmosphere is fun and everything seems to be high-quality.","5006":"My partner and I celebrated our anniversary the other night here. It was our first time and our waiter Oscar was friendly and treated us so well! \n\nExperience: 5\/5\nWe were welcomed with a little anniversary card which was very thoughtful.  The outdoor seating area was really nice and there were heat lamps to keep us warm. The food came out in a timely manner and when we were done with everything, Oscar brought out some complimentary pours of rose to celebrate our special night. Thanks Oscar, you're awesome!!\n\nFood: 4\/5\nWe were brought some popcorn to snack on before the meal. Not sure what the seasoning is but it's really good! The mushroom tartine we ordered was also great and probably my favorite item of the night. Brussel sprouts were delicious too but the sauce was a little heavy for me. Lastly, the famous boneless fried chicken was tasty but not the best fried chicken I've ever had. Maybe I just prefer bones-in. I enjoyed the various dipping sauces on the plate as well.\n\nDrinks: 5\/5\nMy partner had the black Manhattan and I had the gimlet and both were very good, no complaints.\n\nDefinitely want to come back to try everything else on the menu!","5007":"The food was good to great, where the experience fell apart was in the service.    The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived yet (during covid)  we were seated right next two other tables.   I assumed the other tables had reservations but remained empty for the remainder of our stay.   The staff was oblivious to the tables they did have, forgetting to recover tables when food was served, ignoring customers waving checks ready to leave, adding plates to our table without removing empty dishes.  Everyone was on autopilot.   It was a real shame because the food was beautiful and delicious.   I would not return despite that.","5008":"Really lovely place for a date night! (Make sure to make a reservation, especially on weekends.)\n\nThe menu is well-crafted with lots of really tempting options. It's on the slightly more adventurous\/inventive side, which I appreciate. I think some of the items can toe the line between gimmicky and \"unique for unique's sake\" but for the most part, I think the dishes were well thought-out and well-executed.\n\nSourdough pretzel: yummy and comforting. The hop butter and beer mustard seemed like it was trying too hard to be different. I love hops, and I love beer, but in this application, it wasn't working in the butter. Overall, innovative idea, though.\n\nSouthern picnic: Was a cute idea and the pimento cheese was tasty, but I ended up feeling like I wish I had just gotten the \"normal\" cheese board. It was overall just a bit too sweet altogether as an assembly of flavors -- between the ham and sweet jalapeno jelly. I couldn't remember the pickles, which says a lot, actually. It wasn't a very memorable bunch of flavors\/textures.\n\nChicken liver mousse: This made me a fan of chicken liver mousse. It was a wonderful, rich, comforting flavor!\n\nGreat cocktail menu selections here and wonderful ambiance (not to mention its location right in the heart of the urban wine trail). I'll definitely be back!","5009":"Amazing-- the service and the food! Recommend the fried chicken, pork belly, and the Brussels sprouts! Drinks were great too. Will be coming back.","5010":"This place is sooooo good! The ambiance is great outside!. Lots of fire pits and heaters. The food is so good. Tapas style dining and you definitely want to come here with people who like to share and try new food. The menu is not insanely big which is so nice for this style dining. Everything we had was good. Top favorite were the cauliflower and the fried chicken. The service was really top notch too. I would highly recommend trying this place when visiting Santa Barbara or if you live here. I know I'm bringing my friends back here!","5011":"Arrived here Friday night to dine with a friend, and what a treat! Excellent atmosphere. Excellent service. Excellent food. I haven't enjoyed a meal like this since an anniversary dinner at Jano's. Albeit, the company was outstanding, but everything about the Westin makes enjoying time with friends, that much richer. Thanks to the Westin, for an amazing evening, and to my friend Helen.","5012":"They have redone their menu since I was here last summer and it was delicious!!! I was a little bit disappointed in the artichoke that we started off with, however, I had the steak for dinner and it was amazing!!!! Had the bacon wrapped shrimp also for an appetizer and it was delicious!! Excited for dinner tomorrow night!","5013":"The deserts are amazing. The service was great. Very patient with the kids. Breakfast was Solid too.\nIn addition to the wonderful view of the mountains, the food is great","5014":"Great service from Dani!  She was so nice, and took the time to get to know us!  My girlfriend took me here for my birthday dinner last night.  I had the pappardelli pasta with chicken and lots of delicious veggies on it!  A nice glass of white wine, the rolls were ok, and I got a free triple chocolate desert!  Denise had the salmon which looked so thick and juicy! The view was beautiful, and it was quiet and relaxing.  The best!!  There were quite a few things on the menu that sounded great, and it was difficult for me to choose.  Very nice experience!","5015":"In two years in Tucson, our best two meals have been at Azul. We have tried the roast chicken, which sounds boring, but was slightly crunchy on the outside and tasty throughout. We have also sampled the scallops, salmon, and mahi mahi, as well as 3 or 4 of the sides. It is one of those high-end restaurants that provide small portions, but we had a coupon both times. It is pricey, but the results were excellent.","5016":"We've had breakfast at Azul several times and always enjoyed it. Last night was our first dinner experience at Azul. The environment is very nice and the presentation good. What was lacking was flavor. My scallops had a strange off putting chemical flavor and my wife's pasta dish was bland and flavorless.","5017":"Extremely disappointing. I was here for a convention and due to time constraints was limited to my lunch options. First thing I noticed was the lack of smiles on the hosts' faces. Do you really hate your job this much? It does not have to be a genuine smile (although it would be nice), but please, please, do not make me feel like I am inconveniencing you. My second issue with this place was that they had a guest list going for the tables yet there were empty tables (apparently waiting to be bussed) the entire time I ended up waiting for my salad to go (which was about 15 minutes). Which brings me to my last point: the salad.  I ordered a $16 salad advertized to include kale, arugula, tomatoes, croutons, mandarins, and garlic-roasted shrimp. Well, there were four shrimps (garlic - yes, roasted - not really; I felt like I was eating barely warm garlic butter dipped shrimpies), one halved cherry (!) tomato (the tiniest I have ever seen), two pieces of mandarin, and two little croutons.  I estimated the value of this salad to be approximately $4.15.  I guess I hope that the arugula and kale will allow me to last through the next four hours of seminars. Kudos to the restaurant for assisting me in my weight loss (trying to lose a couple of pounds for my wedding), but for those with healthy appetites, this place is not worth your time, money, or palates.","5018":"An absolute beautiful venue for a meal. However the service was sub par and the food disappointing. We ate lunch on two occasions and had breakfast twice. Since the food was mediocre we didn't try dinner. The Westin can do much better!","5019":"As part of my review for the Westin La Paloma,as a whole, I had to credit Ramon at Azul for sharing his pictures from the recent fire in the mountains. Freaking amazing! As Angeleno tourists that knew nothing about this fire, he really made the night and had us staring at the mountains in awe. Cool guy.\n\nOn to the food: The free range chicken was divine. Fellow Yelper JL always teases me about ordering chicken at a restaurant, but I always say that making a truly remarkable chicken is a sign of a great chef. It can go so wrong and oh so right. Glad to say, Azul made it right. Perfectly seared skin and juicy. \n\nThe calamari was also fantastic. So nice, we ordered it twice in two days. The fig and  mission burrata were also good. Almost too good, that we practically were full before the meal came. The cilantro lime shrimp salad was nice, but not as nice as the chicken. \n\nOverall, great time, romantic setting, juicy chicken. What a brilliant time!","5020":"On my last visit to the Westin La Paloma, I made my way to the AZuL bar for a late night snack. The cool, electric blue lights pull you in, and beckon you to \"come hither.\" I was well satisfied with a tasty Farmer's Market Salad featuring fresh arugula, carrots, and avocado. I opted for the calamari appetizer, as well (as I often do, if I see it on a menu). It was fair, but not the best I've ever encountered. Even if I didn't enjoy the food, I would stop by just for the cocktails and the view. They have several clever & creative martini choices here. The 'Royal Blue' (crafted with acai blueberry vodka, Chambord, Cointreau, and cranberry), sent me off to bed with sweet dreams. \n\nThe next day, my crew and I sat in the spacious lounge area, soaking up the gorgeous Tucson views. I have yet to try the full restaurant. We just wanted to nibble on a few apps, so I selected the fries with black and white truffle aioli, and the antipasti plate with burrata, prosciutto, nectarines, & aged balsamic. I also decided to take a chance on the calamari again. The fries and antipasti were quite good, but the calamari seemed even more lackluster this time. It is described as pecan crusted (although it appeared most of pecans were on the plate vs. on the calamari) with an avocado poblano crema and chile de arbol salsa. It is a stellar concept, just not executed very well on these 2 occasions. My delightful 'Pear with a Punch' martini (pear vodka, Pama, sweet & sour) soothed any minor quibbles I had with the calamari, though. \n\nI'm sure I will make my way back to AZuL bar & lounge again soon. I think it's a fab \"date\" or \"girls\/guys night out\" spot.","5021":"Was looking forward to a nice meal outside so I could enjoy the weather and beautiful scenery, then the food came.  Not an undercooked pork chop, a raw one.  Completely ruined the evening.  Who serves raw meat?","5022":"Azul is definitely a favorite of mine.  When I want to take my friends and family out to a place where I know the service and food will be spectacular, I take them to Azul. \n \nAzul has really worked hard on every detail of their dining experience.  They have a wonderful atmosphere, excellent service, and great food.  All their effort has turned Azul into a truly amazing experience.  This is what fine dining is supposed to be!\n \nI've had almost every item on their current menu, and I'm adamant that this is their best menu yet.  My favorite still has to be the seared braised rabbit and pancetta galette dish!  This is the best rabbit dish I've ever had, and the pancetta galette is a crisp and gooey delight!  Every dish I've had, from the slow roasted free range chicken, to the pork chop Milanese, has been exquisite.  Chef Amanda has really made this menu shine, and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. \n \nIf you sit near the windows, you can take in the breath taking views of the mountains while you dine.  If music is your thing, then maybe you could sit near one of the many live acts they often have playing in various spots around the restaurant.  But regardless of where you sit, the staff has got you covered.  Their excellently trained staff is on the top of their game.  They never leave you wanting for anything.  When you go to Azul, they really have you covered. \n \nAzul is one of my favorite places in town.  The staff is always friendly and efficient, the ambience is always what I'm in the mood for, and the food is always out of this world.","5023":"Ordered the chorizo tacos.  Hardly a hint of chorizo in the flavor- very bland overall.  Also SIX DOLLARS for regular orange juice.  Not impressed.","5024":"Service was soooooo slow. Spend 20 minutes for the check and to get the card back. Didn't expect  to waste my time with that","5025":"Really,  stars for the service and food.  I'm generous enough to add the extra star for the cool blue ambiance.\n\nWe checked in later in the evening and decided to have something light for dinner.  The restaurant wasn't very busy when we were seated.  My hubby and I pondered over the menu and decided to share the beet salad with goat cheese ($13), calamari fritto ($12), roasted tomato and mussels ($13).  The KIDS MENU had a choice of pasta with marinara, but opted for pasta with butter and parmesan ($7) for my little cutie pie.  The food is so-so and nothing exciting.  My son's pasta was undercooked and they forgot to put the parmesan cheese.  I should have sent it back but I didn't.  \nOur server was not rude or anything.  She just wasn't as attentive for working at a self proclaimed upscale restaurant.  The busboy didn't pick up the bread plates, so we stacked them.  Our drinking glasses were only filled when we asked for it.   \n\nThe Sunday brunch didn't look all too appetizing or even worth the money, so we headed for AJ's down the street.  \n \nWe would rather eat out for dinner or eat lunch at Sabino's swim up bar.","5026":"Not vegetarian\/vegan friendly. Only dish I was able to get was a cauliflower soup . However service was very kind enough to make double check with the cooks and this view is beautiful","5027":"Granted it was Christmas when we ate, but pretty disappointed. Not that it was bad, just really meh, and certainly not worth the price.","5028":"A-OK, Exactly. Naturally, we were drawn to the gorgeous restaurant nestled right next to the reception desk. We were staying at La Paloma for the weekend so I came down here for drinks frequently that were pretty good, however when I tried this place for lunch it wasn't that good. Tried the Mediterranean-style wrap sandwich, and the bread was so thick with very little meat. The desserts were good, especially the warm cobbler with ice cream and the tiramisu. Not enough to salvage the meal however.","5029":"Very attentive and wine knowledgable server. She recommended the filet and it didn't disappoint. Rubbed with spices and topped with jalape\u00f1o, jicama slaw. She was happy to sub the mash for some veggies. Pared with a nice cab. Not too shabby for a hotel restaurant.","5030":"5 stars for the food and the second waiter that we received.  We had the pork chop, lemon scallops with fettucini and the lasagna rollups.  They were all delicious.  For dessert - we shard the pana cotta, beignets, and molten chocolate cake.  \n\nOur first waitress was terrible - didn't bring the bar menu, didn't bring the lemons and never told us about the specials.  The final straw was when she brought some more bread with no dipping sauces. She would just disappear.   I walked up to the hostess stand to talk to the manager.  They replaced her and he was great.  He was attentive and checked in on us regularily.   \n\nThe manager did rectify the situation immediately and we had a very nice dinner with great food.  The next time we are in Tucson visiting my daughter at college, she wants to go back here again.","5031":"My wife and I were not impressed.  The quality of food and the price of food did not match up, and their service was slow, which I could understand if the restaurant had been busy, but it wasn't.  My wife and I were looking for a new experience and this was a failed experiment.","5032":"Updated review after going to the La Paloma for New Year's Eve. We went to the Azul lounge for drinks and appetizers. We waited at least 20 minutes without recognition that we were sitting in the lounge. My friend went to the bar to request menus. Someone brought 4 menus for our party of 4, handed us 2 of them, then walked away with the other 2. At least 15 minutes later, no one had come to take our order. I went to the bar to request a server and they sent someone over after awhile. Drinks finally came and 1 drink was wrong. Food came and was actually delicious (only reason that it gets 2 stars instead of 1). Server did come to check on us once but never came back. He didn't bring our check after waiting for at least 30 minutes. We finally went to the bar to ask for our check and the bartender reacted like we were really inconveniencing her. Never had such poor service at a Westin.","5033":"I've been to Azul a couple of times now, and my last visit was truly amazing.  They did everything you would expect a finer dinning establishment to do and more!\n\nIt seems like people come to this restaurant for the atmosphere as much as the food.  Azul has even created a comfortable and interesting atmosphere for their guests' enjoyment.  The restaurant is clean throughout, and the look is different from the other places in town.  This seems like a great place for a first date or a business meeting.  They even have a variety of live musicians playing in the background for their guest's enjoyment.  \n\nThe service was great.  My guest and I were never wanting for a thing during our visit.  It seems like their service staff is psychic.  It seems like they were refilling our drinks every time we took a drink, and they were kind enough to refill our complimentary bread twice while waiting.  \n\nBut where Azul really shines is with their food!  I highly recommend the cashew crusted lamb rack.  It was absolutely delicious!  The meat was so tender and very juicy.  It was a large portion of lamb, served with an attractive presentation of spring pea risotto, citrus mint aioli, and tomato chutney.  Everything complimented the lamb, and the entire entr\u00e9e was full of tasty flavors.\n\nThe pan seared arctic char was another success.   The fish was crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside.  The splash of cherry hickory barbeque sauce not only added color to the plate, but a unique flavor to the dish.  Not that the fish needed it, because it was absolutely delicious.  And the grilled asparagus and fingerling potatoes were also great additions.\n\nThe brulee of artisan cheese was another great surprise.  It was an assortment of tangy sauces with an appetizing block grilled cheese.  For dessert, my guest and I really enjoyed the warm molten chocolate torta.  Not much to say about it, other than it was really good too!\n\nI highly recommend Azul to anyone who wants great food with outstanding service.  I will definitely be going back!","5034":"The outdoor patio at sunset is a majestic setting.  However, the food needs more attention.  The calamari was tender but was overly oily.  The roasted chicken breast was on the done side.","5035":"Tasty cocktails and delicious steak.  The atmosphere is nice. I ate here during Shannon's Slumber Party and it beat the hell out of the crap they were selling there.","5036":"Very creative chef - we have dined twice and sampled 4 separate appetizers and 4 entree's.... all were very special. The dining room is quiet elegance and service professional, available but not intrusive. You look out over swimming pools and waterfall with the Catalina Mountains in the background. Sunset on the mountains - lovely food, good wine list - just a beautiful evening.","5037":"This restaurant is the reason I finally got a yelp id. It was unfortunately a terrible dining experience.  I had the rolled noodle with shrimp and the boyfriend had chioppino. My dinner was practically inedible. The waiter, although pleasant, was one if those who said everything on the menu us really good. Wish that had been true. The chioppino seemed ok but a  small portion for the price. The only nice thing was the nice view of the mountains.","5038":"Seriously, I love this place. I have been going to Azul on an d off for quite a while. It is such a pretty place to go haAng out. The food is amazing. The one time that I had bad service there the manager more than made up for it. Now the service is top notch, as is everything else in this place. The layout is perfect for small groups of 3-6 people with comfy chairs and sofas. The bar area is set up so that even when there is music playing you can still carry on a conversation without having to yell. Go for the beauty, stay for the food and go back for the wonderful time you had there.","5039":"This is actually a difficult review to write, so it needs to be broken down....\n\nAtmosphere: 1 out of 5 stars-- \nWe had to ask where Azul was located after walking into the Westin La Paloma. We were pointed in the direction of the stairs.... down the stairs to the breakfast buffet restaurant?!?! Yes, Azul is really not a \"new restaurant\", but new food in an old restaurant. The breakfast buffet station is still there, as are the chairs and uninspiring decor. The image portrayed by the website is the opposite as to the actual vibe (or lack of a vibe) in the restaurant. Boring tan carpet, plain cafeteria style banquettes with the addition of white table cloths. Brightly lit with a very eclectic music selection (opera.. classical... easy listening). \n\nService: 2.5 out of 5 stars -- \nThe service would be perfect... for a breakfast buffet, but doesn't match up with the food. Our bottled water was never poured for us, we weren't asked if we wanted another glass of wine. Forks were sometimes taken away, sometimes dropped.. but never replaced without asking. No offer for coffee or cocktail with dessert. Just average. \n\nNow the good stuff...\nFood: 4 out of 5 --\nThe food is a huge disconnect from the atmosphere and service. And that is a good thing. The food is labeled as mediterranean style. We had the Valentine's Day 4 course meal. Mine: seared scallop carpaccio with a delicious blood orange vinaigrette; ravioli stuffed with goat cheese and arugula; pan seared sea bass with brussels sprouts, bacon and maple butter sauce; dark chocolate valentine gateau. Never had scallop carpaccio (although the \"seared\" and \"carpaccio\" does seem to be a bit of a contradiction), but it was quite good. Ravioli was decent, but not too exciting. Sea bass was perfectly cooked and paired with a nice polenta. Dessert was delicious, with a champagne berry cream with strawberries on the side. Husband had: merlot braised oxtail; ravioli; pancetta wrapped beef tenderloin; same dessert. The braised oxtail was very flavorful and served with caramelized shallots on crostini - good mixture of flavors and texture. The tenderloin itself was a little bland, but definitely was perked up by the cognac mushroom ragout. \n\nWe left somewhat confused... we really loved the food, but wished we could have carried the plates to someplace with nice ambiance and more upscale service. Almost like taking a plate of food from neighboring Janos and eating it at a Village Inn. Just odd. If they remodeled and retrained the servers, we would be back without hesitation, but as of now... not so sure.","5040":"I suggest you find other options. As the main restaurant at the Westin la Paloma resort, one would expect more effort to offer a higher quality restaurant for its guests and visitors. The staff us friendly, but service is annoyingly slow, regardless of time of day. The food is OK at best, but will fill you up if you're hungry. I wish that my comments were more positive, but their management needs to know that improvements should be strongly considered even with a relatively captive (hotel guests) customer base.","5041":"Truth be told, my experience a few weeks back ranked between 2 1\/2 - 3 stars, but that isn't an option!  So, here goes.....\n\nMy wife and I adore the La Paloma resort where the Azul Restaurant and Lounge are located.  There was a time when their service and their food was absolutely impeccable; sadly, that time is no longer.  We ordered a bottle of wine and the young waiter clearly had not been trained in proper wine service etiquette.  In a place like this in the Foothills, that alone is unforgivable.  Beyond that, as the night winded down, the wait staff were more interested in clearing empty tables and other chores rather than helping each other with existing guests.  Drinks went unfilled.  Food came out completely incorrectly.  And, not once did the manager or a representative stop by to see how things were going.\n\nOn the bright side, Azul can rebound from the mediocrity in which they now espouse, though the question remains whether anyone there cares enough to do so.","5042":"Great, friendly service and the eggs bene is pretty tasty.  Great presentation even though I ordered my hollandaise on the side.","5043":"Ambiance-3 stars(construction blocked view\nService- 5 star\nFood-4 star\nPrice- Pricey\n\nHad a coupon which helped the price but the main entree portion was small. Very tasty but small. Salad was very good.  Bread was fresh. Beer was cold. Mac-n-Cheese was great. \n\nI would rate this a 3 for the value. But I guess you don't eat at a hotel restaurant for value...","5044":"I got the prix fixe menu with the Pear & Arugula Salad, Slow Baked Salmon Filet, and Shade of Chocolate. I didn't love the salad, I probably should have asked for the dressing on the side. Even then, the Farmer's Salad looked heartier and better. The salmon was delicious, although a little on the salty side for me. The chocolate desert was delicious. Service was excellent and very accommodating for a large group. If you're staying in the hotel, it's really convenient.","5045":"Came here for breakfast and was irritated and disappointed almost immediately. I called down from my room to see how late the breakfast buffet was being served. I was told 11am. I strolled down at 10:15 to find them clearing the buffet. I asked what was going on and they said there weren't many people so they shut it down early. That would have been nice to know earlier, I could have come down sooner. I was offered the option of ordering off the menu, which I reluctantly agreed to.\n\nThen came the service. In a word... Terrible. I had to wait nearly 15 min to even be seen by a server. All the while bussers were tearing down tables around me (and the other 4 people in the restaurant). The waiter took my order but never offered any water and it was another 10 minutes before he returned with my juice - It's not as if he had a lot if other tables.\n\nThe menu was boring and uninspired. I was really hoping for a good meal. Oh well - I hope I never have to return.","5046":"Tonight was my first time dining here.\nThe hostess was friendly and made a great first impression of Azul.\n\nThe meal was presented nicely and food quality was good. Plates and food came out hot.\nI did not care too much for the taste of my seasonal pork chop creation, but that is my personal taste. The fall squash pur\u00e9e for example tasted a lot like my son's baby food jars. \nOthers might  like it. \n\nI was thoroughly underwhelmed with the quality of the service.\n20 Minute wait for my beverage (no refills). The promised bread and butter never arrived and a soup I had sent back was not taken off the check.\nWe might need some re-training here.\n\nThe restaurant was half empty- staffing seemed sufficient. \nMaybe just one of those days....","5047":"Oh Azul... how amazing you are.\n\nI re-visited Azul, a favorite of mine, for my mother's birthday, and they did not disappoint!  The last couple of times I've visited Azul have been truly amazing experiences.  Quite literally fine dining at its best! \n \nAzul's menu changed with the coming of the new season, and I think this is their best menu yet.  While I miss the lamb from their past menu, there was more than enough to keep my mind off their lamb.  The slow roasted free range chicken was delicious, and the grilled vegetables that accompanied it were equally tasty.  (Can you say grilled taro root?  Yum yum!)\n  \nTheir new seared braised rabbit and pancetta galette dish is my new favorite!  The rabbit is truly amazing, simply the best rabbit I have ever had!  The pancetta galette was just as good as the rabbit.  I wanted to save the best bites for last, but couldn't decide which was better.  Chef Amanda has really created a spectacular menu here.  You simply have to check it out.\n  \nWhile dining, you can bask in Azul's relaxed atmosphere, or take in stunning views out their giant panoramic windows.  The restaurant is clean through and through.  The staff isn't missing a beat either.  They never leave you wanting for anything.  They are bringing you refills, complimentary bread, and new place settings before you even realize you need them.  They even have a variety of live musicians playing in the background for their guest's enjoyment. \n \nI highly recommend Azul to anyone who wants great food with stellar service.  I cannot say enough good things about Azul, and I will definitely be going back!","5048":"My filet mignon was great my salad was terrible. Service was super slow for us. But we sat near a larger party that came after we did and left before we did. For  a $100 meal for two adults and a 2 year old. I was not impressed.","5049":"The short ribs appetizers - very tough.  Chicken - OK but nothing spectacular. Berry cobbler was good.\nService was very good.","5050":"The breakfast buffet was the way to go this morning.  Quite a number of offerings from eggs cooked with bacon,  crispy bacon, fresh sausage (the real stuff), hash browns, pancakes,  and assortment of fresh fruits and other continental breakfast items.  The buffet included our coffee and juice which was nice to have that all in one price of $21\/person.  The food was nicely cooked; was especially surprised at how good the eggs were as buffet eggs are almost always terrible.  Easy option while staying at the Westin and with our $5 off coupons for choosing the \"green option\" for our room was a pretty reasonable deal.  A lovely start to our day.","5051":"I was impressed with the resort and its amenities, however the food was not the best. The pork chop was dry as the ground outside. For the price you would expect more out of the food. The server didn't ask how our food was nor did he check on us enough. When I return next year I would not get food there.","5052":"I went to Azul with some girlfriends during a bachelorette weekend at the Westin La Paloma.  We ate here twice.  Once for dinner and once for breakfast (to-go).  I found the service to be slow at times, but the food was decent and we were in no rush.\n\nFor dinner, we all shared some of the small plates and appetizers.  I really liked the pork belly sliders and surprisingly I really like the calamari, which is something I don't normally eat.  We weren't impressed with the cheese plate, which was lacking most everything... nuts, fruits, etc.  Since we were there celebrating a special occasion, our waitress threw in a chocolate lava cake for dessert.  I consider myself a chocolate lava cake connoisseur and I thought it was top notch.\n\nFor breakfast we decided to take our food to-go so we could sit by the pool.  I had the egg and cheese flatbread, which didn't really wow me.  I can't speak for the other girls, but they did seem to enjoy their food.  \n\nFor what it's worth, I would go back again because Azul served a very important purpose in our weekend.  I think they could provide better service and lower prices a bit to get more customers to flock there, but that's just my two cents!","5053":"We went to Azul as a family our first night in Tucson since we were staying at La Paloma.  The restaurant seemed to be woefully understaffed and it took forever to place a drink order.  I ordered a merlot and it tasted like it had been stored outside in the 105\u00ba heat..., roasted and raisiny.  The waiter brought another glass after a while, from a new bottle, problem solved for the moment.\n\nI ordered the ribeye, medium rare.  The steak they served was less than an inch thick and medium well.  The waiter brought a replacement, 20 minutes later, that was rarer than rare.  Everyone else was already finished with their meals, so I choked it down.  \n\nOverall, way too expensive for such a lack luster experience.  My advice,  drive to one of the many great restaurants within a few miles of the resort (Wild Flower was awesome) and skip eating here.","5054":"This was my 1st time here. Our serverThomas was very attentive. Brandon was our bus boy, very polite and courteous. My salad was fresh and delish. The margarita was excellent. Prices reasonable. Nice, cozy dining area, suitable for conversations and enjoying good company. Highly recommend!","5055":"Food was really overpriced. Service was pretty bad. Steak was Outback quality at Capital Grill price. The rest of the food was serviceable but not great. There are much better options.","5056":"This is my first dining experience at Azul and the food was very decent for a resort restaurant. The menu were all decently priced.","5057":"First of all, the food was fantastic.\nThe service was awful.\nWe had a glass of wine and an appetizer each...it took an hour and a half to get in and out.\nThe restaurant wasn't busy. The wait staff was emotionless and unenthusiastic. We were there for 20 minutes before we were poured water...he mumbled something incoherent; another 20 before our waiter came by. After an hour the bread came and two minutes later the food. When we were finished the busboy simply took our plates without saying anything.","5058":"On Friday evening I attended a charity event at the La Paloma. It was in the ballroom so close to Azuls bar. My boyfriend and I figured we would wander down there to grab a couple of drinks since the ambiance was quite appealing. The bar was busy but not to the point service should have been poor.. Especially with two bartenders. \n\nThe only reason I give two stars rather than one is because the male bartender seemed to be working quite hard and had a positive demeanor. On the other hand, the woman was absolutely awful. She was an older lady and beyond rude. The woman couldn't handling making more than a couple simple drinks at a time. I realized this since I heard a man order a double whiskey rocks, a vodka tonic, and a corona. I was standing next to him so I asked for a xx lager and corona, thinking it would save her time grabbing three beers at once rather than making multiple trips. Her response was \"Shhh! Shhh!!\" As she put her hand out at me motioning to stop. Needless to say I turned around and left the bar. I haven't been treated so poorly at a nice resort let alone any restaurant bar. I think it goes unsaid that I will not be returning to this establishment again.","5059":"A much better-than-average hotel restaurant. Always a little hesitant to try them, but the food (the little I had) and service were both great.\n\nHad the three sisters salad and it was VERY TASTY! Not sure how healthy it was (the main reason for ordering a salad for me) but it had great\/interesting flavors, a light dressing, good crunch, and lots of freshness. \n\nNice wine list and good selection of drinks. Had the Washington Chte Michelle Cabernet Sauvignon and it was outstanding (at 11 a glass- not too bad). \n\nComplimentary bread was brought to the table which was warm, fresh and sinfully delectable. \n\nOverall a great choice.","5060":"Russell Michel is off to an amazing start at Azul. The new chef is in the process of moving to a new menu, but no matter what he conjures up, I hope he keeps his rack of lamb, which is some of the tastiest I've ever had. The chicken was simple, but moist and tasty, and the chocolate tort dessert was truly memorable. \n\nOther hits were the scallops and the side of mashed potatoes (the sides are really substantial at a reasonable price) and the extremely rich mac and cheese (I hate there two nights in a row). The mixed berry cobbler wasn't very tasty, so that's one to skip.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, making both evenings very enjoyable.","5061":"Not impressed, Azul. Had we not had a coupon, I would have been seriously disappointed. \n\nOur waitress was sweet, but totally clueless. The menu is not large - we asked one question, which she didn't know the answer to. \n\nThe calamari was maybe the worst I've ever had. It was cold and looked like it had been sitting on the plate awhile. The sauce was just slopped on. It tasted like I was eating a pretzel in mustard sauce. Very strange.\n\nWe each ordered the steak meal - steak, a salad, and side. \n\nOur steaks arrived in an appropriate time frame, but where were our salads? The kitchen was super backed up according to our waitress. Not sure if that makes sense - how could they cook a steak, but not slap a salad on a plate? \n\nThe salads came out literally 30-40 minutes after the steak. They were nothing special, but fresh, at least.\n\nI ordered my steak medium - it was definitely cooked well - but it had good flavor. The mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts were good.\n\nThe waitress brought the bill without asking if we wanted dessert, which we did. Our bill was $96 and we needed to spend $100. We then ordered the key lime gateau. Who knows how long it was sitting out because it had a dried coating on top - like cooked jello. It was impossible to eat with the film on top - we would have had to use a knife, so I scraped it off ...  mmmm .... lovely.\n\nI won't be back.","5062":"The food is amazing.  I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the rib eye. The service was great as well. We had a very  attentive waiter. Did not have to ask for water as in other reviews. The ambience is great, prices and food quality are great. I go to azul for any special occasion and never had a bad experience..","5063":"Disappointment! =\/\n\nMy boyfriend and I stayed at the Westin resort so we wanted to try this restaurant that was there. We also had a gift certificate that we wanted to use so we ended up eating here for our anniversary dinner. \n\nI can't believe how disappointing it was. We ordered the calamari to start which I thought was a bit salty and I've never had calamari that was topped with greens before. lol. For the entree I ordered the Salmon while my boyfriend ordered the Pork Chop. My Salmon was tiny and was not anything great at all. I've definitely had better. I think the most disappointing part was that the food was just ok, but it was about $25 a plate with NO sides. Each additional side would be $7. \n\nThe only good thing I would say was the the customer service was excellent. My glass was always filled and everyone was extremely friendly. Other than that, I wouldn't come back for $25 a plate for just \"ok\" food.","5064":"Easter Buffet- slow & mediocre service....food quality was decent, but not great! Be prepared to wait in line. Excellant coffee. Replenishment of food was slow, flow of food was wonkey. Ex serup and blueberries before the french toast. Probably will not return. Making the reservation was odd too, had to leave a message for F&B Mgr to call back?","5065":"I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2 because at least they're trying here... They're going for a kind of upscale chill-out lounge vibe, which is pretty bold for Tucson, which tends to vacillate between two extremes: either a kind of 1993 grunge aesthetic on the one hand and a 1989 Kenny G fern bar vibe on the other.\n\nThe seating is spacious and very comfortable and it's a great place for a date where you actually want to talk or a business conversation.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the fancy lights and reasonably cool music you are still at the Westin La Paloma, so how cool can it really be?  But I appreciate the effort.  Ghost Bar, it ain't.\n\nThe bar has their act together.  Perfect drink execution.  The menu, alas, is a different story.  We tried 2 or 3 things during their happy hour and they were all, frankly speaking, horrible.  \n\nService was friendly.  The manager came over and talked to us and asked, for no particular reason, if he could offer us something on the house.  We got the middle eastern plate.  It was really, really sad.  Two pieces of romaine lettuce with about a tablespoon of hummus on each and a small piece of pita bread.  $16!!!  We literally looked at it and laughed. \n\nOnce again, I have to ask, did nobody in Tucson go to culinary school?  Even at the Westin?  Everyone seems to just be making it up as they go along at every restaurant in town here.\n\n(By the way, what is it with the middle eastern places and pita bread in this town?  You always get one piece of pita bread.  What the hell?  It's pita bread.  It's cheap! I really don't get it.)\n\nAnyway, our bill comes and we'd been charged for the sad little hummus plate.  I pointed it out to the server and she cheerfully took it off.\n\nWe would definitely go back for cocktails but I would pass on the menu.","5066":"There are problems with management that should not be happening in this price range. \n\nCame for a birthday with a party of 9, 6pm reservation on a Friday night.  2 other tables filled.\n\nStarted off with a bang with great service, good wine, and everyone's appetizers were a hit (duck tacos, watermelon caprese, calamari).\n\nThings went downhill with the main course.  Over an hour wait, and when it did arrive, everyone who had the scallops absolutely loved it - super tasty, perfectly cooked.  However, the rest of the dishes were cold and overdone.  My ravioli shouldn't arrive a cold, congealed mess at $24.  All of the food would have been tasty if it had not been sitting around - clearly just an issue with the kitchen being able to time the orders.\n\nWe all ordered dessert and coffee.  Took 15 mins for the coffee, which arrived cold.  Staff explained they had not been trained on the machine.\n\nDesert took another 15.  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was super tasty, the chocolate mousse cake was awesome, but I ordered the cheesecake and it was...stale.   When I asked when it had been made, I was told it was six days old.  Felt like we should've been throwing a BD party for the cheesecake, not my friend.  $10 a pop, not cool. \n\nThe staff was great and trying their best, and it has the potential to be a fantastic restaurant, but at this price point diners shouldn't have to deal with this kind of stuff.","5067":"Had dinner at The bar last night. The bartender was very friendly and very knowledgeable on the menu. I ordered the DND to drink, which was basically a very delicious rum punch. I also ordered the steak quesadillas, at the bartender's recommendation. I am so glad I listened. This was honestly the best steak quesadilla I have ever had. It was a generous portion and packed with flavor. I must admit, I was nervous to eat hotel food, but this was gourmet quality!","5068":"I took my 94 year old mother to the Westin Resort and decided to stay in and dine at Azul.  The staff was waiting for us and could not have been more attentive, friendly and helpful.  The food was perfect; we had the scallops and New York Steak.  Both entrees came with a starch and vegetable.  They were beautifully presented.  The cocktails,  appetizer and dessert were equally as good.","5069":"Weary travelers we were. The bartender was on point and she set us straight after a looong drive from Scottsdale. They have this incredible outside patio with heated water fountain thing!! . Ensure you arrive well before sunset to watch the light against the hills. We returned later for a cocktail and our server Kimberlee was the most delightful person we have met on this trip. It's so nice to have a friendly face who takes the time.","5070":"We ended up getting stuck here due to the gas outage so it was nice to actually spend some time here. I thought the lounge atmosphere was nice. It's definitely something Tucson needs. \nThe crowd is a little older then I would have liked. \nThe drinks were pricey and small but tasty so thumbs up to the bartender.\nThe food was shockingly good. I read some negative comments and I have to disagree.\nI tried the wings and the panini. Both were above par. The wings were different then anything I've ever eaten. Good job!\nThe panini needed salt but was good overall. \nThe price is pricey! Go during happy our and get it half off. \nI'll be back....","5071":"The restaurant is in the Westin La Paloma hotel  There is a lounge near the entrance and the restaurant is downstairs.  Both have a wonderful view of the Catalina Mountains.  The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor patio seating.  The menu is not large-two kinds of steak, chicken, pork chop, lasagne and scallops.  They offer a tasting menu where you have a choice of two entrees and either a 2 or 3 course meal.  The \"cottonwood\" is $55.00 for 3 courses including your choice of filet mignon or NY steak so is a pretty good deal.  The organic chicken was a good meal-chicken was tender and sauce was tasty-came with 2 pieces of chicken.  Service was very good.","5072":"Had dinner here last Monday with family and friends.  Overall the experience was good.  The guacamole appetizer was generous but needed some salt.  Service was also good but for a Monday night, it was probably on the slow side.  It was cold outside so we didn't enjoy the scenery that others have mentioned.\n\nI had the grilled pork chop and it was done nicely.  Good portion and cooked nicely...  It went well with the carrot puree.  Based on what others were saying about their meals, it was good but not great.  Would probably come back on a warmer night to sit outside and enjoy the scenery.","5073":"New Years Eve Dinner. Classy joint. Nice ambiance. Decent price for a nice upscale dinner. Wait staff was friendly and attentive.","5074":"We went his afternoon. Grandpa ordered coffee, never arrived. The tortillas came in a filthy napkin Hair included. Wait staff not even trained to apologize! Burger came with cold fries. Overpriced & mediocre. Save yourself","5075":"The dining trio of my mother, Gary (husband) and I was intact and ready for new culinary experiences. So off we went to Azul. It's a lovely restaurant on the lower level at La Paloma, with fantastic views of the noble Catalina Mountains.\n\nThe summer can be a much quieter time at an early dinner dining hour at resorts, and we found it pretty much the case when we visited. We decided to try soups, salads and entrees on this visit. Everything is a la carte, so bring a well-padded wallet or credit card account.\n\nDinner rolls were tasty with a crusty exterior with soft interior, served with virgin olive oil and pepper. We also asked for balsamic vinegar, which is so good with olive oil.\n\nGary's French onion soup was the winner, hands down! A generous crock with baked-on cheese arrived. It was full of sweet onions in a lovely bouillon (not too salty) that was actually a little sweet. I had to wrench myself away from gobbling more of it (It was Gary's dish). My mom's bean and ham soup was also tasty, with a light clear base. Just watch out for some fatty ham pieces (used to season it, I'm sure). I ordered a basic salad with a delicious (citrus?) dressing. It was a great mix of greens and veggies, including arugula.\n\nWe had been tempted by some entrees we saw listed on the Entertainment Book page for Azul, but found that the menu had changed and those dishes were no longer offered. The meals we purchased ranged from $19 to $28. Gary's chicken was tasty and mom's sea bass was served filet-style at her request (normally served tail-on & head-on). It was tender and tasty, a slight bit salty. My salmon was very delicious and perfectly cooked. It also was a tad bit salty (as if it had been salted just before serving it). We opted not to order the side vegetables, which sounded great, but we did not think we'd have room for them ($7 each side).\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt. We enjoyed our meals and that great view. It is a bit upscale in cost for a la carte and the portions. See photos. I would suggest the restaurant consider adding some greens or rice-or something-to the plate to give it some substance. And if you want a snack or light meal, that French onion soup would hit the spot!","5076":"5 Star View and Setting for Breakfast, but 3 Star Food and Service...the view was stunning on the patio overlooking the pool and the mountains.  The breakfast buffet was good, but nothing extraordinary.  Service was slow, but very friendly!","5077":"Sorry, the waiter was attentive and friendly but the fish I ordered was tasteless and overcooked even though I had specifically requested it to be slightly cooked and the portion was very small ) I took three teaspoons and was done)The vegetables were flavorless and  needed more cooking. The mixed salad hardly had any  dressing and had red peppers that needed to be sliced thinner. For the price of it all it wasn't worth it. I would go there for drinks next time or for coffee and a desert which was the only thing ok. Thei tiramisu was too sweet and the portion was small for the price . It hardly had any cake to\nIt. The service needed more attention to see if\nwe needed anything as we had to call them for water, Eric and there wasn't that many people.","5078":"My wife and I went there for Valentines diner. When I made the reservation, I was not told it was a fixed menu. So we were not very happy with the surprise! They seated us 35 minutes after our reservation time. Again not happy! Wait staff did the best they could but the food was marginal at best. The table next to ours ask to see the manager, who never did stop by. He just took 50% off their bill. We talked to waitress about how tough the steaks were and thought the manager might come by but he just took 20% off our bill. This one of the worst displays of what a manager is suppose to do! Very disappointing! Will not be back!!!!!","5079":"I've eaten here once before during a previous Westin stay and was not impressed. All I remember was the ceviche definitely left something to be desired. However, I believe Azul makes the food for room service at the Westin, and my most recent meal was delish.\n\nIf my assumptions on the room service are correct, the breakfast was perfectly made. I requested 2 poached eggs, wheat toast, and sausage. The sausage was a tad greasy, but it had a nice snap and good flavor.\n\nFor dinner I ordered a glass of Washington chardonnay, the market salad, and the shrimp ravioli (quattro formaggio). The market salad had beets, carrots, pistachios, and some fancy greens over a horseradish cream. The cream was INTENSE and delicious. I loved the salad! The ravioli was supposed to come with 3 giant shrimp, but instead came with 7 LARGE shrimp - yay! There was a perfect amount of broccolini\/roasted grape tomatoes\/mushrooms, and the sage butter is to die for. Do note that you should NOT eat the sage.... I don't think I've ever cooked with sage nor remember specifically having sage... but it's INTENSE by itself. Don't eat the sage lol. I did respect that they weren't just button mushrooms, but also some fancy ones thrown in.\n\nI would order dinner again!","5080":"Came in for dessert and bubbles. Katie waited on us and was fantastic!  She was very friendly!  She did a great job!!","5081":"Oh my, this was a delight.  Especially after reading some of the reviews.  We were seated immediately, had service immediately and were continually being pampered and served immediately.  Krista was our server, she was very attentive and took care of our every dining need.\n\nWe ordered champagne as we were celebrating our 17th anniversary.  She asked if we were celebrating a special event or was it just a champagne type night.  We shared with her it was our anniversary. She immediately said it would be their pleasure to comp us dessert.\n\nWe shared a Caesar salad, it was an average salad, I'm glad we shared it because it was alot of salad.  Then we both ordered proven\u00e7ale dijon crusted rack of lamb. Our sides were fresh grilled asparagus and baked cauliflower gratin. Every item was delectable!  I couldn't find anything to fault them.  They made our anniversary so very special and a wonderful experience.  \n\nNot only was the meal delicious, but the dessert they served was served on a plate that said Happy Anniversary!  To top this all off we had a coupon for $25 off, which even made our evening sweeter than sweet!  \n\nI totally recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special event or just to have a delectable dining experience.","5082":"Went out to lunch at Azul. The restaurant area was very quiet, kind of odd to be the only one dining in a restaurant, but there was a great view of the mountains. The architecture of the Westin is beautiful, a lot more upscale than what you would normally find in Tucson. \nThe waitress was friendly, and started us off with warm bread with oil and pesto that was delicious. My boyfriend and I shared a carafe of Sangria that was also very good. \nThe portion size of our lunch was quite large. I ordered a spicy shrimp meal with fries and it was probably the best shrimp I've ever had.  My boyfriend had a panini that was also quite tasty.  Not what you would normally expect for hotel food.","5083":"We spent a weekend at La Paloma and while there we spent some time and lots of money at the Azul Lounge.  The views are amazing but a lot of the seating is faced away from the mountains which doesn't make sense.  Service was slow at first but we arrived in the middle of happy hour so we just helped ourselves to the bartender.  Everyone was friendly enough but $20 for 2 cocktails is way overpriced.  Nothing fancy just some Captain and cokes.  I understand you're a resort but really?  We had a couple then ventured out.  The next day we went to the restaurant and enjoyed their breakfast buffet which was a very nice spread and even prettier to look at.  They had something for everyone and setup so you could easily find and help yourself to anything from scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, sweet breads, toast, oatmeal, salsas, yogurt and fresh fruit and jams.  Delicious!  I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for breakfast but we did enjoy it while we were there.","5084":"It's a special time when I get to visit my home city and make new memories where the old ones began! Myself, friends and family dined outside on the gorgeous patio during a recent stay and we were smiling from ear to ear! Our server Daniel did something I wish all servers did- \"read the room\". He was attentive, helpful, knowledgable, but most importantly he knew when to check in on us and when we were obviously enjoying the food, spirits, and views. \n\nMY RECOMMENDATIONS: Adobo dry wings and carne asada nachos to start- Salmon Veracruz, the burger, and the steak torta were big hits. I was SO SAD they were out of their TRES LECHES, but it was for a good reason. \n\nAgain, a beautiful experience all in all- don't trust negative reviews- trust this Tucson native who makes an absolute point to keep AZUL and La Paloma a \"must see\" on visits home! Thanks for the memories!","5085":"This restaurant is offers a great menu ( see photos, different from that on Yelp)but is extremely overpriced given the fact that it is one of the 2-3 dining options in the Westin La Paloma Resort and Spa.\n\nHaving arrived in the resort on a hot Arizona summer evening, I chose to have a light salad (Tomato and Watermelon) and indulge in dessert for dinner but when my salad arrived I was quite shocked seeing the portion! Though the plate looked quite pretty, it was nowhere near worth $12!!! I had requested for walnuts to be added to my salad, and it was brought without any. When I requested it a second time, a small bowl of walnuts were given on the side...\n\nThe Triple chocolate mousse dessert was the saving grace, but I do wish there were better dining options for resort guests!","5086":"Two terrible experiences in 24 hours.  Dinner was sub par and the breakfast buffet was empty the whole time we were there.  Not Westin quality at all.  Not sure what is happening at this place.","5087":"For $40 a plate price range... yea no. We ordered the beef tenderloin medium rare (came out late with burnt crust) and the chicken ravioli (came out late and chicken was rubbery with bland white cream sauce). Then the straw that broke the camel's back was the cheese cake being served on a piece of bread... no joke. See picture.","5088":"I came to the Westin for a conference and normally I don't eat in the hotels because of the prices. Unfortunately, the Westin La Paloma is set back a bit from everything, so grabbing a quick lunch or dinner away from the hotel can be tricky. On the first day, I had lunch at the restaurant. A Cobb salad that cost around $20 after tip. That salad was worth every dime I paid. Every bit of it was as fresh as you would want it to be for that price. I feel like I ate a salad from a chef as opposed to a pre-made concoction from a chain restaurant. So, on my last night I decided to splurge a bit for dinner. Two beers (Blue Moon at $7 a bottle) with the Azul Burger. Let me explain this religious experience. The bun is freshly baked. No mistaking it. The hamburger meat taste like it came from a butcher rather than food services company. Grilled onions, fresh, unwilted lettuce, tomato and some fancy cheese that tastes the way cheese is supposed to taste on a burger. The fries were good. I'm not a fry fan, but these were appropriate for the burger.\nThere are more expensive meals that I would now feel confident purchasing.\nAzul is a quality restaurant in a hotel, not a hotel restaurant. Those who travel often will know what I mean.","5089":"My boyfriend and I arrived this morning for a beautiful weekend here at La Paloma. We came down this evening to enjoy dinner on the patio down at Azul. Our waiter, Tyler, was the most pleasant person and made our experience so much better! He was very educated on the menu, as well as drinks and wines. We made small talk as well letting us know he truly cares. Food was amazing but wanted to leave this review based on Tyler's performance. Will definitely come back. Thanks again Tyler","5090":"I should probably preface this by saying I've never tried their food. The views are spectacular and the bar area has a nice open feeling, but I just don't feel like anyone goes out of their way to make the evening remarkable. Staff trots around helping tables on multiple levels it seems, they rarely make eye contact, and short of snapping it's hard to have a server come by your table. I'd probably spend more time here if I felt like people cared about my experience, but that just doesn't seem to be the case.","5091":"I ate at Azul 2 years ago for my birthday and it was probably one of the most memorable birthday dinners I've ever had. The atmosphere is so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. It's located at the bottom level of the lobby at La Paloma so you will get a nice view of the mountains and pool area. I had tortilla soup for my first course, open faced lasagna for my main course, and creme Brule. This restaurant is fine dining without feeling uncomfortable. It's pricey but delicious.","5092":"Listen, considering this is a hotel restaurant, I give it high marks. Excellent service, outdoor seating, good drinks and a good selection of Tex-mex ish options is what you can expect. I had a great quesadilla with the fixings and it was great. Definitely would eat again while in the area.","5093":"I want to first say that I'm basing my review of this place off of the food, and not the staff. To start, everyone we encountered was extremely nice and helpful. However, the food was atrocious. To corroborate someone else's review, the dinner rolls were the best part of the meal. I ate here on 2 different nights, and ordered the ribeye which came with asparagus and potatoes. The second day, I ordered some adobo dry rub wings. All I can say is if you love unbearably salty food, then come come. Secondly, if you love paying tons of money for food with worst quality than bar food, then come here. I understand it's a hotel, but for the price, I think they can manage to step up the quality.","5094":"We just finished a long drive, just wanted a drink and a light snack. Last time here, we had a great experience at Azul so decided to go back. Unfortunately this time a huge auction event was being set up for that evening, so the bar was not open. We went to the main dining area which was only occupied by one other table of people. We ask the one and only hostess\/server if we could just have a drink and snacks and yes was the answer.\n\nWe sat outside on the beautiful patio, ordered a Martini a little dirty with extra olives and a Cosmo not to sweet, Chips Guacamole and Salsa. When the drinks came out both were served in a highball glass with the smallest pour I've ever had. My Cosmo came out rubie red, no vodka and again the tiniest mixed drink I've ever had. When we complained, we were told that was the pour and they don't have martini glasses. Really! That's because they were all allocated along with the bartender to the auction event! Told the server that the drinks were unacceptable. Round 2, drinks came back in martini glasses and prepared correctly. And for the note the Guacamole Salsa and chip were very good.","5095":"The updated review is more of a 3.5. I have eaten at Azul numerous times, and dined here a few months ago when I was staying in the hotel. \n\nIt was very clear that this place has been one of the many victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was very evident with the menu selection, which was simplified, but mostly with employees. In the past, this restaurant was staffed with very polite and well-trained people in their 20s. This time, it seems they were all layed-off, and they brought in employees from the kitchen--like dishwashers to do the table service. Their demeanor just did not seem like they were trained adequately to do they job they were doing. When someone in my party accidently bumped their elbow and splattered a little bit of coffee on the table, the older \"gentleman\" who was responsible for walking around filling up drinks made a joking, and somewhat snide comment. I wouldn't have been fazed by this at an IHOP or Wafflehouse, but it sure did at a four-star resort.\n\nThe bar staff were fantastic, though. I did come down in the evening for a nice, stiff drink and they always did a great job\n\nWith all that said, the posole verde was absolutely phenomenal, and a very rare treat. Only the red and white variants tend to be common out here.\n\nI think once COVID-19 starts to come to an end, this restaurant will be back to its former glory. Until then, I'd be cautious.","5096":"What a disappointment. It's such a beautiful venue, you want the food to be good, too...too bad it just isn't. The dinner rolls were the highlight of the meal, and I'm sure they weren't house made. I had the chicken poblano. It came with Calabacitas. The chicken was significantly over done and tough. The sauce was bland and uninteresting. If there was poblano in this recipe, I couldn't taste it. The Calabacitas were terrible...greasy, with very little flavor. My mother had an incredibly uninspired turkey sandwich melt with overly salted sweet potato fries. To top it all off, I went home with a stomach ache. I'm not prone to them. The only good thing I can say about this place is that of course it's a lovely view, and that the service was excellent. I feel bad for the people who work here, but maybe they make some money on the booze. Bottom line: if you're out for drinks, it's probably a great spot. If you want a meal, go elsewhere.","5097":"My husband and I had dinner at Azul last night. \nWe had reservations, and were seated promptly at a lovely outside table. Our waiter was personable, knowledgeable, and efficient. Service was very prompt. My gosh, the view of the mountains is breathtaking! \nOur meal was delicious. I had the salmon, but my husband wanted something lighter and got the Caesar salad with the spicy chipotle dressing and added chicken. They were both delicious, and the portions were very generous. \nWe live in Tucson, and enjoy Dining at Azul. It's not just for hotel guests.","5098":"We went here for breakfast the morning we were leaving. It was absolutely perfect. We had the chorizo tacos and the lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both of which I recommend. The mimosa was mainly champagne instead of orange juice and I certainly wasn't complaining about that! \n\nOur waitress Lilia is what really made this a memorable experience though. She anticipated our every need, managed that tenuous line between not coming to the table enough and coming too much perfectly, she was so friendly and welcoming. We cannot say enough great things about her.","5099":"This place is good for breakfast but the food isnt very impressive. Many, if not all of the breakfast menu items can be found in their buffet (which I also found overpriced compared to other Westin hotels I have been to). The selection was alright and felt more like the kind of breakfast you would find at a holiday inn express or marriot but at a much higher price. If you do opt for the buffet its almost $22 per adult and includes coffee and OJ. \n\nThe staff is very attentive and nice but if you pay with cash be prepared to wait for your change.","5100":"Romantic ambiance, AMAZING service, and options not found on other Tucson menus!\n\nRib-eye cooked perfectly & whole grilled sea bass. Whipped potatoes with marscapone and brussel spouts with apple wood bacon both a must try.\n\n***Desserts are lacking, stay away from the \"molten cake\" ( it was molten alright, burnt to the core) and the panna cotta( made with oh so many gelatin strips).","5101":"The views are simply amazing. Tres leches was my favorite menu item. Dinner menu was a little more limited than I would prefer.","5102":"I recently took my significant other here for his birthday together w my 2 teenager kids. The experience wasn't really something you can rave about. It was just ok. \nThe hotel lobby is lovely: grand staircase to the restaurant, big arched windows with a picture view of the Catalinas & the hotel's gorgeous pool. But upon careful scrutiny, it looks like the hotel is begging, not to be updated, but cleaned. Dust in between staircase & corners, peeling wall paper in the bathroom. \nOur server that day was polite but impersonal, or lacking the inclination to make us leave impressed. The food for its exorbitant price is so-so.... not memorable. I liked it tho that they didn't charge for my SO's chocolate\ncake, even that didn't taste impressive. Will we\ncome back? Maybe to do staycation but will def\nstay away from this restaurant."},"date":{"0":"2017-12-29 17:47:57","1":"2016-02-04 18:50:12","2":"2015-06-21 02:55:23","3":"2014-05-08 14:14:54","4":"2017-07-08
